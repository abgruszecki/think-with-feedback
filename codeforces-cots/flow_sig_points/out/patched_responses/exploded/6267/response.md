Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of swaps needed to make a binary string balanced. Balanced here means that the number of "01" subsequences equals the number of "10" subsequences.

Hmm, first, I need to understand what makes a string balanced. Let's think about the counts. The number of 01 subsequences is the count of all pairs where a 0 comes before a 1. Similarly, the 10 count is all pairs where a 1 comes before a 0. For these two to be equal, the total must be the same. But how?

Wait, the total number of such pairs is actually the same. Because for any pair of two different characters, it's either 01 or 10. So the sum of 01 and 10 counts is equal to the number of 0s times the number of 1s. For them to be equal, each must be equal to half of that product. But that product must be even for that to be possible. However, the problem states that the input can be made balanced, so we don't have to check for that.

So, the condition for the string to be balanced is that the product of the number of 0s and 1s is even. Because (c0 * c1) must be even, otherwise (c0*c1)/2 would not be an integer. Wait, but the problem says the input can be made balanced. So when c0 * c1 is even, then it's possible. Because then each 01 and 10 counts can be (c0*c1)/2 each. So, our first step is to calculate c0 and c1 (counts of 0s and 1s in the string). If the product is even, then possible.

But the problem says that the input can be made balanced, so we don't have to check that. So our goal is to rearrange the string such that the 01 and 10 counts are equal, which requires that the product c0*c1 is even, which the problem ensures.

Wait, but even if the product is even, how to arrange the string such that the counts are equal. For example, in the sample input 101, c0=1, c1=2. Product is 2, which is even. Then the counts are (1*2)/2 =1 each. Which they are.

So the balanced condition is equivalent to c0*c1 being even. Because the sum is c0*c1, and each part must be half of that sum. So, the problem reduces to rearranging the string into a form where the counts of 01 and 10 are each (c0*c1)/2.

But how does the arrangement affect these counts? For example, in the string 101, the 0 is between two 1s. The 01 pairs are (0,1) and (0,3), and 10 pairs are (1,3). So each count is 2 and 1? Wait, no. Wait, 01 pairs are pairs where a 0 is followed by a 1. So in 101 (positions 1:1, 2:0, 3:1), the 01 pairs are (2,3). But the 10 pairs are (1,2), (1,3). So 01 count is 1, 10 count is 2. But in the first example, the output says that the counts are equal. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait the first example input is 101. The output is 0, meaning it's already balanced. Let's see:

The problem statement says that in the first example, the counts are 1 each. How?

Wait, for 01 pairs: indices where 0 comes before 1. So in 1 0 1, the 0 is at index 2. The 1s after it are index 3. So one 01 pair. For 10 pairs: any 1 followed by 0. The first 1 is index 1, followed by 0 at index 2. Then the first 1 (index1) is followed by 0 (index2), but the 0 is followed by another 1. So 10 pairs are (1,2) and (1,3) perhaps? Wait no, the 10 pair requires s_i=1 and s_j=0 with i<j. Wait no, wait the 10 subsequence is when a 1 is before a 0. So in 101, how many such pairs are there?

Wait, the string is '1','0','1'. So possible 10 pairs: indices (1,2) only. Because s[1] is 1 and s[2] is 0. Then the 10 count is 1. The 01 pairs are (2,3). So 1 each. Hence balanced. Oh right, because the other 1 (index3) is after the 0. So only (2,3) for 01. So both counts are 1.

So how does the arrangement affect the counts. For example, the 0s and 1s need to be arranged such that the number of 0s before 1s is equal to the number of 1s before 0s.

Wait, but the total possible pairs is c0*c1. So to have the counts equal, each must be exactly half of that. So the arrangement must split the 0s and 1s such that the number of 0-1 pairs is equal to the number of 1-0 pairs.

But how to achieve that. Let's think: For a string to have equal 01 and 10 pairs, the arrangement must be such that the number of 0s before each 1 is balanced by the number of 1s before each 0. Wait, perhaps the optimal arrangement is when the string is either a palindrome (if possible) or some balanced arrangement. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement must have an equal number of 0s and 1s, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, let's take the example where c0=3 and c1=3. Then the product is 9, which is odd. So that's impossible. But according to the problem statement, the input can be made balanced, so perhaps the product must be even.

So, the key is that the counts of 0s and 1s must multiply to an even number. Then the required counts are (c0*c1)/2 each.

So the first step is to find c0 and c1. Then check if their product is even. If not, but according to the problem statement, the input can be made balanced, so maybe this is not necessary here.

But for the problem, we need to arrange the string such that the 01 and 10 counts are equal, which is possible.

So, how to arrange the string to minimize the swap steps.

Wait, the swap steps can swap any two characters. Each swap can change two positions. The goal is to reach a certain arrangement with minimal swaps.

The problem is similar to finding the minimal number of swaps to arrange the string into a certain target pattern, which meets the balanced condition.

But what's the target pattern? There might be multiple possible target patterns (different arrangements of 0s and 1s) that meet the balanced condition, and we need to find the one that requires the minimal swaps from the original string.

So the approach could be:

1. Enumerate all possible target arrangements that satisfy the balanced condition.

2. For each such target, compute the minimal number of swaps required to reach it from the original string.

3. Choose the minimum among all these.

But the problem is that for a string of length up to 100, enumerating all possible arrangements is impossible. So this approach is not feasible.

Hence, we need a smarter way.

Wait, but maybe the target arrangement has a certain structure. For example, the minimal swaps would correspond to swapping the string into a specific arrangement that can be computed based on the counts of 0s and 1s.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal swaps can be determined by the positions where the 0s and 1s are misplaced in a certain target pattern.

Wait, let's think about the structure of the balanced string. The balanced condition is that the number of 01 pairs equals the number of 10 pairs, which is (c0 * c1)/2 each.

Let’s model the arrangement. Suppose we have a certain number of 0s and 1s. Let's say c0 is the count of 0s, c1 the count of 1s, and c0 * c1 must be even.

In a balanced arrangement, the sum of all 0s before 1s plus the sum of 1s before 0s equals c0*c1, and each must be (c0*c1)/2.

Hmm. Let's think of the arrangement as a sequence where each 0 contributes to some 01 pairs and each 1 contributes to some 10 pairs. To get the total for each to be (c0*c1)/2, perhaps the arrangement must be such that each 0 has exactly (c1)/2 1s after it, and each 1 has (c0)/2 0s after it. Wait, but this might not always be possible. Or perhaps the arrangement is such that the 0s and 1s alternate in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the balanced condition can be achieved by having exactly (c0*c1)/2 01 pairs. Let's think of the arrangement where all 0s are to the left of all 1s. Then the 01 pairs would be c0 * c1, and the 10 pairs would be 0. Which is not balanced. So that's bad.

Another arrangement: alternating 0s and 1s. For example, if c0 = c1, then the number of 01 pairs would be equal to the number of 10 pairs. For example, 0101: the 01 pairs are positions (1,2), (1,4), (3,4). 10 pairs are (2,3), (2,4), (3,4) if that's the case. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps in such a case, the counts are balanced.

Wait, perhaps for a balanced arrangement, the number of 0s and 1s must be even. But no, the product c0*c1 must be even. So one of them must be even.

So, possible scenarios:

Case 1: c0 is even and c1 is even. Then product is even.

Case 2: c0 is even and c1 is odd, or vice versa. Product is even.

Case 3: both are odd. Product is odd. But according to problem constraints, this case can't happen.

So the problem ensures that either c0 or c1 is even, or both are even.

So, given that, how to arrange the 0s and 1s such that the number of 01 and 10 pairs are equal.

Let’s think of an example where c0=2 and c1=3. Product is 6, which is even. Each must be 3.

Wait, how to arrange 0s and 1s such that the number of 01 pairs and 10 pairs are both 3.

For example, the string 11010. Let's see:

But in the third sample input, the string 11010 is not balanced. The output is 1. After swapping, it becomes 01110. Let's see:

In 01110, the 0s are at positions 1,2. The 1s are positions 3,4,5.

The 01 pairs are the 0s followed by 1s. Each 0 at 1 and 2 contributes 3 1s (positions 3,4,5). So 2*3=6 01 pairs. Wait, but the product c0=2, c1=3 is 6. So each count should be 3. But this arrangement gives 6. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the sample input 3 is 11010. Original counts are c0=2, c1=3. So product is 6, each count should be 3. But the original 01 count is 1, 10 is 5. So after swapping, the 01 and 10 counts become 3 each.

So the arrangement after swap is 01110. Let's see:

0 at position 1: 3 1s after (positions 2,3,4,5? Wait 0 in pos1, then in 0 1 1 1 0. Wait, no. The string after swap is 01110. So positions are 0:0, 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:0.

Wait wait, the sample input says after the swap, the string becomes 01110. Let's analyze:

Original input was 11010 (c0=2, c1=3). After swapping two characters to get 01110, which has the same c0 and c1.

In 01110:

The 01 pairs are:

0s are at positions 0 and 4. Wait no, the string is 0,1,1,1,0. So the 0s are positions 0 and 4. 1s are 1,2,3.

So 01 pairs: 0 at 0 has 1s at 1,2,3. 0 at 4 has no 1s after. So total 3.

10 pairs: 1s followed by 0s. 1 at 1 has 0 at 4. 1 at 2 has 0 at4. 1 at 3 has 0 at4. So 3 pairs. So yes, each count is 3.

So the arrangement 01110 has the 0s and 1s arranged in a way that the 01 and 10 pairs are equal.

So, how to find such an arrangement, and then compute the minimal swaps.

The problem is to find the minimal swaps to reach such an arrangement.

But how to model the target arrangement.

Alternative approach:

The minimal swaps would be determined by how many 0s and 1s are in the correct positions in the target.

But first, we need to find what the target arrangement looks like.

But what's the pattern of the target arrangement?

Hmm. Let's think about the balanced condition. The number of 01 pairs is equal to the number of 10 pairs, which is (c0 * c1)/2.

The 01 pairs can be calculated as sum over all 0s of the number of 1s to their right.

Similarly, the 10 pairs are sum over all 1s of the number of 0s to their right.

So the balanced condition is:

sum_{i where s[i] is 0} (number of 1s after i) = sum_{j where s[j] is 1} (number of 0s after j) = (c0 * c1)/2.

So to find the arrangement where this equality holds.

But how to model this.

Alternative idea: For the sum over 0s of the 1s after them to be equal to (c0*c1)/2, perhaps the arrangement has to be such that for each 0, the number of 1s after it is exactly (c1)/2. But wait, if c1 is even, then each 0 would contribute c1/2 1s after. Then total would be c0 * (c1/2) = (c0*c1)/2. Which is exactly the required value.

Similarly, if c0 is even, then each 1 would have exactly c0/2 0s after, leading to sum of c1*(c0/2) = (c0*c1)/2.

So the target arrangement must be such that:

If c1 is even, then every 0 in the string has exactly (c1 / 2) 1s after it.

If c0 is even, then every 1 in the string has exactly (c0 / 2) 0s after it.

But how to arrange this.

For example, if c1 is even, then perhaps the 0s are arranged such that the first half of the 1s are before some 0s, and the second half after. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 0s and 1s are arranged in a way that for each 0, exactly half of the 1s are after it.

This seems possible if the 0s and 1s are arranged in a way that the 0s are placed such that each has exactly half of the 1s after them.

But how to model that.

Let's take the case where c0 is even. For example, c0=2, c1=3. Then c0 is even. Then each 1 must have exactly (c0/2) =1 0s after it. So each 1 in the string should have exactly one 0 after it.

So for the sample input 3, the target arrangement would have each 1 followed by one 0.

But in the sample's target arrangement (01110), the 1s are at positions 1,2,3, and the 0s are at 0 and 4. So for each 1:

- position1: after are 1,1,0. So 1 zero after. So count is 1.

- position2: after are 1,0. Count is 1.

- position3: after is 0. Count is 1.

So each 1 has exactly 1 zero after. So the sum is 3*1=3, which equals (2*3)/2=3. So that works.

So, in the case where c0 is even, the target is to arrange the 1s such that each has exactly (c0/2) 0s after them.

Alternatively, when c1 is even, arrange the 0s so that each has exactly (c1/2) 1s after.

So the approach could be:

Depending on which of c0 or c1 is even, the target arrangement will have certain positions for 0s and 1s.

But how to model this.

Another example: c0=3, c1=4. Then c1 is even. So each 0 must have 2 1s after it.

So the sum is 3*2=6, which is (3*4)/2=6.

In this case, the 0s must be placed such that each has exactly 2 1s after.

So how to arrange the 0s and 1s for that.

Perhaps the 0s are placed in positions where they are followed by two 1s each. For example, in a string like 0011101 (but I'm not sure, need to check).

Alternatively, maybe the target arrangement is such that the first k 0s are placed before the first m 1s, etc.

Wait, perhaps the arrangement is as follows:

If c1 is even (so each 0 must have (c1/2) 1s after), then the 0s are arranged in such a way that each 0 is followed by exactly (c1/2) 1s. But how to achieve that.

Alternatively, the 0s are arranged in a group where each 0 is followed by a certain number of 1s.

Alternatively, the 0s are placed such that the first part of the string has 0s, each followed by exactly (c1/2) 1s, and then the remaining 1s.

Wait, perhaps the 0s are positioned in such a way that after each 0, there are exactly (c1/2) 1s. For example, if there are 3 0s and 4 1s, each 0 must be followed by 2 1s.

But the sum of 3 * 2 =6. Which equals (3*4)/2=6.

So, the 0s would need to be placed in positions where each has exactly 2 1s after.

But how to arrange them. For instance, for 3 0s and 4 1s, the arrangement could be 0 1 1 0 1 1 0. Then for each 0:

First 0: followed by 1,1,0,1,1,0. So number of 1s after is 4? No, that's 4 1s. Wait, no. Let's see:

Wait, the first 0 is at position 0. The 1s after are positions 1,2,4,5. So 4 1s. But each 0 needs to have 2 1s after. So that's not right.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement is a balanced mix where each 0 is followed by exactly two 1s. But how.

Alternatively, the arrangement could be such that each 0 has exactly two 1s after it, but the positions are interleaved.

Alternatively, perhaps the target arrangement is not unique. So the minimal swaps depend on the closest possible arrangement to the original string.

But this complicates things.

So, perhaps the approach is:

The target arrangement must be such that the 0s and 1s are arranged in a way that for each 0, there are exactly k 1s after it, and for each 1, there are exactly m 0s after it, where k = (c1)/2 (if c1 even) or m = (c0)/2 (if c0 even).

But how to model this.

Alternatively, when either c0 or c1 is even, the optimal arrangement is to split the 1s (if c1 is even) into two equal parts, or split the 0s (if c0 is even) into two equal parts.

Wait, here's an idea. Let's suppose that c1 is even. Then each 0 should have exactly c1/2 1s after it. So the 0s are arranged in such a way that each 0 has exactly (c1/2) 1s after. How?

One possible way is to arrange the 0s such that all the first (c1/2) 1s are before the 0s, and the remaining (c1/2) 1s are after. Then each 0 is in between the two halves of the 1s. So for example, if c1 is 4, then the 0s are placed after the first 2 1s and before the next 2 1s. Wait, but this way, each 0 has exactly 2 1s after it.

But then the 0s would all be in a group. So the arrangement is 1s (c1/2) followed by 0s (c0) followed by 1s (c1/2). But in this case, each 0 is followed by exactly (c1/2) 1s. So this would satisfy the condition.

Similarly, if c0 is even, then arrange the 1s in such a way that the first (c0/2) 0s are after the 1s, and the next (c0/2) 0s are before.

Wait, but for example, if c0 is 2 and even, c1 is 3. Then the arrangement would be 0 0 followed by all 1s. But then each 0 has 3 1s after, but the required is (c1/2) which is 1.5, which is not possible. Wait, but in this case, c0 is even (2) but c1 is 3, which is odd. So according to the problem's condition, the product must be even. 2*3=6 is even, so possible. So in this case, the target arrangement must have each 1 followed by exactly 1 0. Which is possible by placing each 1 followed by exactly 1 0.

But how to arrange that. For example, 1 0 1 0 1. Then each 1 has 2 0s after? No, for each 1, the number of 0s after is:

1 at position 0: 0s at 1 and 3. So 2.

1 at position 2: 0 at 3. So 1.

1 at position4: none.

Total sum: 2+1+0=3. Which is (2*3)/2 =3.

So this arrangement would work.

But how to model such arrangements.

Alternatively, perhaps the target arrangement is such that for each 0, the number of 1s after it is (c1/2) if c1 is even, and for each 1, the number of 0s after is (c0/2) if c0 is even.

So, the target can be determined based on which count is even.

So, the approach is:

- Compute c0 and c1.

- If c0 is even and c1 is even:

   Then we can choose to arrange based on either 0s or 1s, whichever gives a better (minimal swap) arrangement.

- Else, if c0 is even: arrange the 1s such that each has exactly (c0/2) 0s after.

- Else (c1 is even): arrange the 0s such that each has exactly (c1/2) 1s after.

But how to model this.

Once the target arrangement is determined, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of swaps to reach that arrangement.

But the target arrangement could have multiple possibilities. For example, when both c0 and c1 are even, there are two possible target arrangements (based on 0s or 1s), and we need to choose the one that requires the minimal swaps.

So the plan is:

1. Compute c0 and c1.

2. If both are even:

   a. Generate the two possible target arrangements: one where each 0 has (c1/2) 1s after (arrangement A), and one where each 1 has (c0/2) 0s after (arrangement B).

   b. For each of these arrangements, compute the minimal swaps required.

   c. Choose the minimal between the two.

3. Else if c0 is even:

   Generate arrangement where each 1 has (c0/2) 0s after.

4. Else (c1 is even):

   Generate arrangement where each 0 has (c1/2) 1s after.

But how to model these arrangements.

But how to represent the target arrangement. For example, when c1 is even, and each 0 has exactly (c1/2) 1s after it. How to create such a arrangement.

Let's think of the arrangement as a string where the 0s are placed in positions such that after each 0, there are exactly k 1s. For example, for c0=2, c1=4 (even), k=2.

So, each 0 must have exactly 2 1s after. So the 0s are placed such that between the 0s and the end of the string, there are exactly 2 1s.

But how to arrange them. For example, if the 0s are placed at positions where there are two 1s after each. But perhaps the 0s are placed in the first part of the string, but interleaved with 1s.

Alternatively, perhaps the target arrangement is a certain permutation of 0s and 1s that can be determined by a certain pattern.

Wait, perhaps for the case where c1 is even, the target arrangement is such that for each 0, there are exactly (c1/2) 1s after it.

One way to achieve this is to arrange the 0s such that each 0 is followed by exactly (c1/2) 1s, and the 1s are split into two equal groups: some before the 0s and some after.

Wait, for example, if there are 4 1s (c1=4), then each 0 must be followed by 2 1s. So the 0s can be placed between the first 2 1s and the next 2 1s. So the arrangement is 1,1,0,0,1,1. Then each 0 has 2 1s after. So that's correct.

Another example: c0=3, c1=4. So each 0 must have 2 1s after. The arrangement could be 1,1,0,0,0,1,1. Each 0 is followed by 2 1s. But in this case, the 0s are grouped together. Each 0 in this group has the same number of 1s after.

But if there are three 0s, then each would have two 1s after. Let's see: positions 2,3,4 (assuming zero-based or one-based). Wait, the 0s are at positions 2,3,4. After each, there are two 1s (positions 5 and 6). So each 0 has 2 1s after. So the sum is 3*2=6 = (3*4)/2=6. Correct.

So for c1 even, the arrangement is to split the 1s into two equal parts, and place all 0s between them.

Similarly, when c0 is even, the arrangement is to split the 0s into two equal parts, with all 1s between them.

So, the target arrangement for when c1 is even is: first (c1/2) 1s, then all c0 0s, then (c1/2) 1s.

And when c0 is even: first (c0/2) 0s, then all c1 1s, then (c0/2) 0s.

But how to model this.

So, the steps for the algorithm would be:

For each possible target pattern (depending on whether c0 or c1 is even):

1. Generate the desired target string (e.g., for c1 even, the pattern is '1'*(c1/2) + '0'*c0 + '1'*(c1/2)).

2. Compute the minimal swaps needed to reach this pattern from the original string.

Then, choose the minimal among all possible targets.

But how to compute the minimal swaps between the original and the target.

Wait, the minimal number of swaps needed to turn the original string into the target is equal to the number of positions where the original and target differ, divided by 2, but only if the differing positions can be swapped. Wait, no. Because each swap can fix two differing positions. For example, if a position has a 0 but the target has a 1, and another position has a 1 but the target has a 0, swapping them would fix both positions. So the minimal number of swaps is (number of differing positions where s[i] is 0 and target[i] is 1) divided by 2. Because each swap can fix two such differences.

But wait, the number of positions where s[i] is 0 and target[i] is 1 must be equal to the number of positions where s[i] is 1 and target[i] is 0. Because the counts of 0s and 1s are the same in both the original and target strings. So the number of 0→1 differences is equal to the 1→0 differences. Thus, the total number of swaps is equal to the number of 0→1 differences divided by 2.

So, the steps to compute the swaps for a given target pattern are:

- For each position i, compare original[i] and target[i].

- Count the number of positions where original is 0 and target is 1 (call this cnt01).

- The number of swaps needed is cnt01 // 2.

Because each such swap fixes two differences.

Alternatively, the number of swaps is the number of mismatches divided by 2, since each swap fixes two mismatches.

But wait, perhaps the total number of mismatches must be even, and each swap reduces the count by 2.

So, for a given target, the minimal swaps is (number of 0→1 mismatches) // 2.

Because the number of 0→1 and 1→0 mismatches must be equal (since the counts of 0s and 1s are the same between original and target), so cnt01 = cnt10. So the total mismatches is 2*cnt01. And each swap reduces cnt by 2.

So the minimal swaps is cnt01.

Wait, no. Because each swap fixes two mismatches. For example, if in positions i and j, original is 0 and 1, and target is 1 and 0. Swapping them fixes both. So each such pair requires one swap. So the number of such pairs is cnt01, and each requires one swap. So the total swaps is cnt01.

Ah, right. Because cnt01 is the number of 0→1 mismatches. Each such requires a swap with a 1→0 mismatch. So each pair contributes one swap. So the total number of swaps is cnt01.

So for a given target pattern, the number of swaps is the number of positions where the original is 0 and the target is 1. Because the number of 1→0 positions is the same.

So the algorithm is:

For each possible target pattern (based on c0 and c1 evenness):

1. Generate the target string.

2. For each position i, compute whether original[i] and target[i] are different, and count how many times the original is 0 and target is 1 (cnt01).

3. The swaps needed is cnt01.

Then, among all possible target patterns (could be one or two, depending on evenness of c0 and c1), choose the minimal swap count.

So, the approach is:

- For the given s, compute c0 and c1.

- Determine all possible target patterns based on evenness of c0 and c1.

- For each possible target pattern:

   a. Generate the target string.

   b. Compute the required number of swaps.

- Choose the minimal swap count among all targets.

Now, the problem is to generate the target patterns correctly.

For example, when c1 is even, the target is '1' * (c1//2) + '0' * c0 + '1' * (c1//2).

When c0 is even, the target is '0' * (c0//2) + '1' * c1 + '0' * (c0//2).

But in the case where both are even, there are two possible targets, so we need to consider both and choose the minimal swaps.

So, for example, if c0=2 and c1=2, both even. Then possible targets are:

- '1100' (based on c1 even: 1s split into two groups of 1 each, 0s in middle).

- '0011' (based on c0 even: 0s split into two groups of 1 each, 1s in middle).

But maybe other targets are possible, but according to our earlier reasoning, these are the possible candidates.

But wait, in this case, the target could also be '1010' or '0101', but the way we generate the targets is based on splitting into two groups. So perhaps the way we generate the targets is correct.

Another example: c0=3, c1=4. c1 is even. So target is '11' + '000' + '11'. Which is '1100011'. Then each 0 has 2 1s after.

So for the sample input 3, where c0=2, c1=3 (c0 even), the target pattern is '00' + '111' + '0' (but wait, c0 is 2, so split into 1 and 1. So first part is '0' * (2//2) = '0', then the 1s (3), then '0' * (2//2) = '0'. So the target is '0' + '111' + '0' = '01110', which matches the sample's target. So in this case, the swaps needed are computed by comparing the original '11010' with the target '01110'. The differences are:

Original: 1 1 0 1 0

Target:   0 1 1 1 0

Comparing each position:

Pos 0: 1 vs 0 → target 0 (original 1 → mismatch).

Pos 1: 1 vs 1 → match.

Pos 2: 0 vs 1 → original 0, target 1 → mismatch (count as 0→1).

Pos 3: 1 vs 1 → match.

Pos4: 0 vs 0 → match.

So the cnt01 is 1 (pos2) and the cnt10 is 1 (pos0). So swaps needed is 1. Which matches the sample's output.

So this approach works.

So, the plan is:

Generate all possible target patterns based on evenness of c0 and c1.

For each target, compute the required swaps (cnt01) and choose the minimal.

Now, the code steps:

1. Read the input string.

2. Compute c0 and c1.

3. Generate possible targets:

   a. If both c0 and c1 are even:

      - Generate two targets: one for c0 even and one for c1 even.

   b. Else if c0 is even:

      - Generate one target: split the 0s into two parts and 1s in the middle.

   c. Else (c1 is even):

      - Generate one target: split the 1s into two parts and 0s in the middle.

4. For each target in the generated list:

   a. Compute the number of positions where original is 0 and target is 1 (cnt01).

   b. swaps = cnt01.

5. The answer is the minimal swaps among all targets.

Now, implementing this.

But how to generate the target string.

For example, when c0 is even:

target = '0'*(c0//2) + '1'*c1 + '0'*(c0//2)

Similarly, when c1 is even:

target = '1'*(c1//2) + '0'*c0 + '1'*(c1//2)

But in the case when both are even, generate both.

So, in code:

targets = []

c0 = s.count('0')

c1 = len(s) - c0

if c0 % 2 == 0 and c1 % 2 == 0:

    # Both even: generate two targets

    target1 = '0'*(c0//2) + '1'*c1 + '0'*(c0//2)

    target2 = '1'*(c1//2) + '0'*c0 + '1'*(c1//2)

    targets.append(target1)

    targets.append(target2)

elif c0 % 2 == 0:

    # c0 even: split into two parts

    target = '0'*(c0//2) + '1'*c1 + '0'*(c0//2)

    targets.append(target)

else:

    # c1 even

    target = '1'*(c1//2) + '0'*c0 + '1'*(c1//2)

    targets.append(target)

Once targets are generated, compute the swaps for each.

Now, comparing each position between original and target.

For example, in code:

def compute_swaps(original, target):

    cnt01 = 0

    for o, t in zip(original, target):

        if o == '0' and t == '1':

            cnt01 +=1

    return cnt01

But wait, the original and target must have the same length, which they do.

So, the code for each target in targets:

min_swaps = infinity

for target in targets:

    swaps = compute_swaps(s, target)

    if swaps < min_swaps:

        min_swaps = swaps

return min_swaps

Thus, the code should work.

Now, test the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

Input: 101 → s is '101'

c0=1, c1=2 → product 2, even. But c0 is 1 (odd), c1 is 2 (even). So generate target based on c1 even.

target is '1'*(1) + '0'*1 + '1'*1 → '101'. So original and target are same. swaps=0. So output 0.

Sample 2:

Input: 1000110 → c0=3, c1=4 → c0 is odd, c1 even. So generate target based on c1 even.

c1//2 = 2. So target is '11' + '000' + '11' → '1100011'. But original is 1000110.

Wait, wait. Let's compute c0 and c1 for input 1000110:

s is '1','0','0','0','1','1','0' → c0 is 4 (positions 1,2,3,6), c1 is 3 (0,4,5). So c0=4, c1=3. Then product 12, even.

So c0 is even (4), so the target is split into two parts of 2 zeros each, with 3 1s in between.

So target is '00' + '111' + '00' → '0011100'.

Original is '1000110'.

Compare:

Original: 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Target:   0 0 1 1 1 0 0

For each position:

0:1 vs 0 → mismatch (10).

1:0 vs 0 → okay.

2:0 vs1 → 0→1 (cnt01 +=1).

3:0 vs1 → cnt01 +=1.

4:1 vs1 → okay.

5:1 vs0 → 1→0, but not counted in cnt01.

6:0 vs0 → okay.

So cnt01 is 2 (positions 2 and 3).

Swaps required: 2.

But the sample's output is 0. Wait, this is a problem.

Wait, the sample input 2's output is 0, meaning the string is already balanced. So according to the code, when the target is generated, but the original is not the same as the target, but in reality the string is balanced.

Ah, this indicates a flaw in the approach. Because the code's generated target may not be the only possible balanced arrangement. The original string may already be balanced, but not in the generated target patterns.

Wait, this is a critical issue.

In sample input 2, the string is already balanced, so the code should generate a target that matches the original, or find that the required swaps are zero.

But according to the code's approach, when c0 is even (4) and c1 is 3 (odd), the target is generated by splitting the 0s into two groups of 2 each, and 1s in between. So target is '0011100'.

But the original string is '1000110', which is already balanced, but the code will compute swaps for the target '0011100' as 2, and the actual correct answer is 0. So this approach is wrong.

Ah, so the approach of generating only a specific target pattern is incorrect. There might be other target arrangements that also satisfy the balanced condition and are closer to the original string.

Thus, the previous reasoning is flawed.

So, the initial approach of generating certain target patterns and choosing the minimal swaps between them is incorrect.

We need a different approach.

Alternative approach:

The problem is that the previous code assumes that the only possible balanced arrangements are the ones generated by splitting the 0s or 1s into two equal groups. But the actual balanced arrangement can be different.

So, the previous approach would miss some possible target arrangements, leading to incorrect results.

Hence, a new approach is needed.

Alternative idea:

The balanced condition requires that the sum of 1s after each 0 equals (c0 * c1)/2. So, the arrangement must have this sum. But how to find such arrangements and compute the minimal swaps.

But enumerating all possible arrangements is not feasible for n=100.

Another idea: the minimal swaps required to balance the string depends on the current positions of 0s and 1s, and their contribution to the sum.

But how to model this.

Alternative plan:

We need to find a permutation of the string's characters (same count of 0s and 1s) such that the sum of 1s after each 0 is equal to (c0 * c1)/2. The minimal number of swaps required to reach such a permutation is the answer.

But how to find such a permutation and compute the minimal swaps.

But for n=100, this is computationally challenging.

Alternative approach: the minimal swaps are determined by the number of inversions between the current string and the desired string. But how to model the desired string.

But perhaps the minimal swaps can be computed by finding the positions of 0s and 1s in the desired arrangement, and then matching them with the current arrangement.

But the desired arrangement is not unique, so we need to find the one that requires the minimal swaps.

But how.

Another idea: the required sum of 1s after 0s is (c0*c1)/2. Let's denote this as required_sum.

The current sum for the original string is sum_01 = sum for each 0 in the string, the number of 1s after it.

sum_01 should be equal to required_sum.

But the original sum_01 may already be required_sum. In that case, no swaps are needed.

But if not, we need to swap characters to adjust the sum.

But how to compute the minimal swaps to adjust the sum.

This is unclear.

But in sample input 2, the sum_01 is 6. required_sum is (4*3)/2=6. So the original sum is already correct. Hence, no swaps are needed. But according to the previous approach, the code would generate a target pattern and require swaps, which is incorrect.

So, the initial approach fails to account for the possibility that the original string is already balanced, even if it doesn't fit the generated target patterns.

Thus, the code needs to first check if the original string is already balanced, which can save some steps.

But how to check if the original string is balanced.

Yes, compute sum_01 and sum_10. If they are equal, then output 0.

But sum_01 is the number of 0-1 pairs in the original string. sum_10 is the number of 1-0 pairs.

But sum_01 + sum_10 = c0 * c1. So if sum_01 == sum_10, then sum_01 = sum_10 = (c0*c1)/2.

So, to check if the original string is already balanced, we can compute sum_01.

If sum_01 == (c0*c1)/2, then output 0.

Otherwise, proceed with finding the minimal swaps.

But even if the original sum is correct, there's no guarantee that the code's generated targets would have the same sum. So, the code must first check if the original string is balanced. If yes, output 0.

So, the first step is to check if sum_01 equals required_sum. If yes, return 0.

Otherwise, proceed.

But in sample input 2, the original sum is 6, which equals (4*3)/2=6. So the code would output 0.

But according to the previous approach, the code would generate a target that is different from the original, leading to a higher swap count.

Thus, the code must first check this.

So, the modified steps:

1. Compute c0 and c1.

2. Compute required_sum = (c0 * c1) // 2.

3. Compute sum_01 for the original string.

   a. sum_01 is the number of 0-1 pairs.

   b. For each 0 in the string, count the number of 1s to the right.

4. If sum_01 == required_sum: return 0.

5. Else: proceed to generate target patterns and compute minimal swaps.

But even after this, the problem remains: the code's generated targets may not include the optimal arrangement, leading to higher swaps than necessary.

So, the previous approach is incorrect.

Alternative approach:

The problem requires the minimal number of swaps to reach a balanced string. Swaps can be between any two characters (not necessarily adjacent).

The minimal number of swaps to reach a certain arrangement is equal to the number of positions where the current and target characters differ, divided by 2. Because each swap fixes two positions.

But this requires that the target arrangement is known.

But how to find the optimal target arrangement.

Alternative idea: the minimal swaps needed to achieve a balanced arrangement is the minimal number of swaps required among all possible balanced arrangements.

But for n=100, this is impossible to compute directly.

Thus, we need a way to model the target arrangement that can be achieved with minimal swaps.

The key insight is that the minimal swap count is determined by the number of misplaced 0s and 1s in the optimal arrangement.

But what's the optimal arrangement?

Perhaps the optimal arrangement is one that is as close as possible to the original string, thus requiring minimal swaps.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding the optimal positions for the 0s such that sum_01 equals required_sum.

But this is challenging.

Alternative approach:

Let's model the problem as finding the set of positions for the 0s such that the sum_01 for those positions is required_sum. Then, among all such possible sets, find the one that requires the minimal swaps from the original positions of the 0s.

But how.

The minimal number of swaps is determined by the number of 0s in the original string that are in their desired positions.

But the problem is similar to finding the minimal number of swaps to move the 0s into certain positions.

Let's suppose we have a desired set of positions for the 0s. The minimal swaps needed to achieve this is equal to the number of 0s in the original string that are not in their desired positions, but this is not necessarily correct.

Because each swap can exchange a 0 and a 1. So, if there are k 0s that are not in their desired positions and k 1s that are not in their desired positions, the minimal swaps is k/2.

But how to find the desired positions of the 0s.

Alternatively, perhaps the desired positions of the 0s are those that maximize the number of 0s already in their positions, thus minimizing the swaps.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding a subset of positions to place the 0s such that the sum_01 for those positions is required_sum, and the number of 0s already in those positions is maximized.

But this is a combinatorial optimization problem that's difficult to solve for n=100.

Alternative idea: since the required_sum is (c0*c1)/2, which depends on the counts of 0s and 1s, perhaps the positions of the 0s can be determined by their contribution to the sum_01.

For example, placing a 0 in a position with more 1s to the right increases the sum_01.

Thus, to achieve the required_sum, we need to arrange the 0s in positions where their combined contribution of 1s after is equal to required_sum.

But how.

The sum_01 is the sum over all 0s of the number of 1s after them.

So, to maximize the sum_01, place the 0s as early as possible.

To minimize, place them as late as possible.

But the required_sum is a fixed value. So, we need to find a set of positions for the 0s such that their sum of 1s after is required_sum.

But how.

This seems similar to a knapsack problem: select exactly c0 positions such that the sum of the number of 1s after each selected position is equal to required_sum.

But for n=100, this is computationally feasible with dynamic programming.

But even this may be challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem by selecting the positions of the 0s in such a way that the sum_01 is required_sum, and then compute the minimal swaps to reach this configuration.

The steps would be:

1. Compute the required_sum.

2. For the original string, compute the sum_01. If it equals required_sum, return 0.

3. Else, find the positions to place the 0s such that the sum_01 is required_sum, and the number of 0s already in those positions is maximized.

4. The minimal swaps is (number of 0s not in the desired positions) // 2.

But how to find such positions.

Alternatively, the problem can be transformed into finding a subset of c0 positions such that the sum of the number of 1s to the right of each position in the subset is equal to required_sum.

But this is a challenging problem.

Alternative idea: the sum_01 can be computed as follows:

For the entire string, precompute for each position i the number of 1s after i.

If the character at i is 0, this contributes to sum_01.

But if the character is 1, it doesn't.

So, if we can select c0 positions (could be any positions) where the sum of the number of 1s after each selected position is equal to required_sum, then the minimal swaps needed is the minimal number of swaps to move the 0s into those positions.

But how to find such positions.

This is the crux of the problem.

For example, in sample input 2:

The original sum_01 is 6, which equals the required_sum. So no swaps needed.

In sample input 3, the original sum_01 is 1. required_sum is (2*3)/2=3. So sum_01 is 1 <3. So need to arrange the 0s in positions where their sum of 1s after is 3.

The solution is to move the 0s to positions 0 and 4 (as in the sample's target arrangement). Let's see:

Position 0 has 3 1s after. Position 4 has 0 1s after. Sum is 3+0=3. Which matches required_sum.

But how to find such positions.

The problem is to find a subset of positions (exactly c0 of them) where the sum of the 1s after each position is required_sum.

Once we find such a subset, the minimal swaps required is the number of 0s not in the subset positions, divided by 2.

But how to find this subset.

This seems like a variation of the subset sum problem, which is NP-hard. But for n=100, and required_sum up to 100*100=1e4, this is possible with dynamic programming.

But how to model it.

Let's precompute for each position i, the number of 1s after i. Let's call this ones_after[i].

Then, the problem becomes selecting exactly c0 positions, such that the sum of ones_after[i] for those positions is required_sum.

The minimal number of swaps is the number of 0s in the original string that are not in the selected positions. Because each such 0 needs to be swapped with a 1 in a selected position. The number of such swaps is the number of 0s not in selected positions (since each swap fixes two positions).

Wait, the number of 0s not in selected positions is equal to the number of selected positions that are currently 1. Because the selected positions must have exactly c0 0s. The number of 0s in the selected positions is x. So the number of 0s not in selected positions is (c0 - x). But the selected positions must have exactly c0 0s. So the number of 1s in the selected positions is (c0 - x). These 1s must be swapped with 0s in unselected positions.

So the number of swaps is (number of 1s in selected positions) + (number of 0s in unselected positions) divided by 2?

Alternatively, the number of swaps is the number of positions where the original character is 0 but not in the selected set (need to swap them out) plus the number of positions in the selected set where the original character is 1 (need to swap in 0s). The minimal number of swaps is the maximum between these two, but since each swap can fix one of each.

So, the number of swaps is the number of 0s not in the selected positions (A) plus the number of 1s in the selected positions (B) divided by 2. Because each swap can fix one A and one B.

So, swaps = (A + B) // 2.

But A = number of 0s not in selected positions = (original c0) - (number of 0s in selected positions).

B = number of 1s in selected positions = (number of selected positions) - (number of 0s in selected positions) = c0 - (number of 0s in selected positions).

So A + B = (c0 - x) + (c0 - x) = 2*(c0 -x).

Swaps = (2*(c0 -x))//2 = c0 -x.

So swaps = c0 -x, where x is the number of 0s in the selected positions.

So to minimize swaps, we need to maximize x.

Thus, the problem reduces to finding a subset of c0 positions with sum_ones_after = required_sum, and the maximum x (number of 0s already in those positions).

This way, the minimal swaps is c0 -x.

Thus, the algorithm becomes:

1. Precompute ones_after[i] for all positions.

2. Find all subsets of c0 positions such that the sum of ones_after[i] for those positions is required_sum.

3. Among all such subsets, select the one with the maximum x (number of 0s in the subset).

4. The minimal swaps is c0 -x.

But how to find this subset.

This is a variation of the subset sum problem with a constraint on the size of the subset and maximizing the number of elements already in a particular state (0s).

But for n=100, this is computationally challenging.

However, the constraints on the input size are small (n <= 100), which makes this approach feasible with dynamic programming.

The dynamic programming state can be defined as dp[i][k][s] = the maximum number of 0s that can be selected among the first i positions, choosing exactly k positions, and achieving a sum of s.

The goal is to find dp[n][c0][required_sum], which is the maximum number of 0s in the selected subset.

The recurrence would be:

For each position i (0-based), for each possible k (number of selected positions up to i), for each possible sum s:

- If we select the i-th position:

   new_k = k + 1

   new_s = s + ones_after[i]

   new_x = current_x + (1 if s[i] is '0' else 0)

   update dp[i+1][new_k][new_s] to be the maximum between its current value and new_x.

- If we do not select the i-th position:

   carry over dp[i+1][k][s] = max(dp[i+1][k][s], dp[i][k][s])

The initial state is dp[0][0][0] = 0.

Once the DP is filled, the answer is the maximum x where dp[n][c0][required_sum] exists.

The minimal swaps is then c0 - x.

If no such subset exists (but according to the problem statement, the input can be balanced), then it's guaranteed to exist.

But for n=100 and required_sum up to 100*100=1e4, this DP may be feasible.

But with n=100, c0 up to 100, and sum up to 1e4, the state space is 100 * 100 * 1e4 = 1e8, which is manageable with optimizations.

But even 1e8 is a bit large for Python. However, given the problem's constraints (n up to 100), and the time limit of 2 seconds, this approach may be possible.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Precompute ones_after for each position.

   For each i in 0..n-1:

      ones_after[i] = number of 1s in s[i+1..n-1]

2. Compute required_sum = (c0 * c1) // 2.

3. Check if the original sum_01 equals required_sum. If yes, output 0.

4. Else, compute the maximum x using DP.

5. Minimal swaps is c0 -x.

But how to compute sum_01 for the original string.

sum_01 is the sum of ones_after[i] for all i where s[i] is '0'.

So:

sum_01 = sum( ones_after[i] for i in range(n) if s[i] == '0' )

Thus, step 3 is to compute this sum and compare with required_sum.

If sum_01 == required_sum, output 0.

Else, proceed with DP.

Thus, the code will look like:

Compute ones_after array.

Compute sum_01. If sum_01 == required_sum: print 0.

Else:

   Run DP to find the maximum x.

   swaps = c0 -x.

   print(swaps).

Thus, this approach correctly handles the sample input 2, since the sum_01 is already required_sum, so output is 0.

For sample input 3:

sum_01 is 1. required_sum is 3.

DP will find a subset of 2 positions with sum 3 and maximum x.

In the original string '11010', the zeros are at positions 2 and 4.

If the desired subset is positions 0 and 4:

sum_after[0] is number of 1s after 0 in the original string. The original string is '1','1','0','1','0'.

ones_after for position 0: s[0] is '1', so if we select this position, but it's a 1. But in the desired subset, we need to select positions with 0s. Wait, no. The desired subset is any positions, but when we select a position, if the original s[i] is 0, then x increases by 1.

In the target arrangement, the subset is positions where the 0s are placed. For example, in the sample's target arrangement, the 0s are at positions 0 and 4.

In the original string, position 0 is '1', position 4 is '0'.

So x = 1 (only the 0 at position4 is in the selected subset).

sum of ones_after[0] (if selected) is ones_after[0] = number of 1s after position0: s[1], s[3] are '1's. So 3 positions (1, 3,4? Wait, position0 is index 0. After that are positions 1,2,3,4. So s[1] is '1', s[2] is '0', s[3] is '1', s[4] is '0'. So the number of 1s after position0 is 2 (positions 1 and 3).

So ones_after[0] = 2.

ones_after[4] is 0.

Sum is 2 +0=2, which is not 3. So this subset is not valid.

Another subset: positions 2 and 3.

ones_after[2] is number of 1s after position2: s[3] is 1, s[4] is0 → 1.

ones_after[3] is 0.

Sum is 1 +0=1, not 3.

Another subset: positions 0 and 3.

ones_after[0] =2, ones_after[3]=0 → sum 2.

No.

What about positions 0 and 1?

ones_after[0]=2, ones_after[1] = 2 (after position1, s[2] is 0, s[3] is 1, s[4] is 0 → 1 one. So ones_after[1] is 1.

Sum is 2+1=3. So sum is 3.

In this case, the selected positions are 0 and 1.

In the original string, these positions are '1' and '1'.

So x is 0 (no zeros in these positions).

Thus, swaps = 2 -0 = 2. But the sample's output is 1.

So this approach would give a wrong answer.

Wait, this suggests that the DP approach may not be sufficient.

But the sample's optimal solution is achieved by moving the 0 to position0. In the selected subset of positions 0 and 4, the sum is 2 (from position0) + 0 = 2, which is not required_sum. But the desired sum is 3.

So how does the sample achieve the required sum of 3.

In the sample's target arrangement, the sum_01 is 3.

In the target arrangement '01110' (positions 0,1,2,3,4):

0s are at positions 0 and 4.

ones_after[0] = number of 1s after 0: positions 1,2,3 → 3 ones.

ones_after[4] =0.

Sum is 3 +0 =3.

So the subset of positions 0 and 4 gives the required sum.

In the original string, these positions are '1' and '0'. So x is 1 (only position4 is 0 in the original).

Thus, swaps = 2 -1 =1. Which matches the sample's output.

So the DP approach would need to find this subset (positions 0 and 4) with sum 3.

But how to compute ones_after[i] for the original string.

In the original string '11010' (indices 0-4):

For each position i:

i=0: s[i] is '1'. The 1s after are positions 1,3.

But in the original string, after i=0, the characters are '1','0','1','0'. So 1s are at 0+1=1 and 3. So ones_after[0] = 2.

i=1: s[i] is '1'. After are '0','1','0' → 1 one. So ones_after[1] =1.

i=2: s[i] is '0'. After are '1','0' →1 one. So ones_after[2]=1.

i=3: s[i] is '1'. After is '0' →0 ones. So ones_after[3]=0.

i=4: s[i] is '0'. No characters after. So ones_after[4]=0.

So the ones_after array is [2, 1, 1, 0, 0].

 required_sum is 3.

We need to select 2 positions (since c0=2) where the sum of ones_after is 3.

Possible subsets:

- positions 0 and 1: sum 2+1=3. x is 0 (both are 1s in original).

- positions 0 and 2: sum 2+1=3. x is 1 (position2 is 0).

- positions 1 and 2: sum 1+1=2 <3.

- positions 0 and 3: sum 2+0=2 <3.

- positions 2 and 4: sum 1+0=1 <3.

- positions 0 and 4: sum 2+0=2 <3.

- positions 2 and 3: sum 1+0=1.

- positions 1 and 4: sum 1+0=1.

Hmm, but according to this, the only subsets that sum to 3 are positions 0 and 1 (sum 3), and positions 0 and 2 (sum 3).

So the maximum x is 1 (for subset 0 and 2: s[0] is '1', s[2] is '0'. x=1).

So swaps would be 2-1=1.

Which is correct.

Thus, the DP approach would select this subset.

Thus, the code would return 1 for sample input 3.

Thus, the approach is correct.

Thus, the code must be implemented with the DP approach.

Now, implementing the DP.

In Python, for a string of length 100, the DP table can be represented using dictionaries or 3D arrays. But for efficiency, we can use a 2D array for each step, and update it for each position.

But even with n=100, c0=100, and required_sum=5000 (assuming 100*100/2), the state space is manageable.

But in Python, using a list of dictionaries or a 3D list may be feasible.

Implementing the DP:

Initialize a 2D array for the current state of (k, s) → maximum x.

For each position i from 0 to n-1:

   For each possible k in 0..c0:

      For each possible s in 0..required_sum:

          if current state (k, s) exists:

              consider not taking position i: carry over.

              consider taking position i: new_k = k+1, new_s = s + ones_after[i], new_x = x + (1 if s[i] is '0' else 0).

Thus, the code can be written as:

Initialize dp as a list of dictionaries. dp[k] is a dictionary mapping sum to the maximum x.

Initially, dp[0] = {0:0}.

For each i in 0 to n-1:

   new_dp = [{} for _ in range(c0+1)]

   for k in range(c0+1):

       for s in dp[k]:

           current_x = dp[k][s]

           # Option 1: not take i

           if s in new_dp[k]:

               if current_x > new_dp[k][s]:

                   new_dp[k][s] = current_x

           else:

               new_dp[k][s] = current_x

           # Option 2: take i, if k < c0

           if k < c0:

               new_k = k+1

               new_s = s + ones_after[i]

               if new_s > required_sum:

                   continue  # no need to track sums larger than required

               added_x = 1 if s[i] == '0' else 0

               new_x = current_x + added_x

               if new_s in new_dp[new_k]:

                   if new_x > new_dp[new_k][new_s]:

                       new_dp[new_k][new_s] = new_x

               else:

                   new_dp[new_k][new_s] = new_x

   dp = new_dp

After processing all positions, check dp[c0][required_sum]. The maximum x is dp[c0].get(required_sum, -infinity).

If it is found, then swaps = c0 -x.

Else, it's impossible (but the problem states it's possible).

Thus, the code will be:

Read s.

Compute c0 = s.count('0'), c1 = len(s) - c0.

required_sum = (c0 * c1) // 2

Compute ones_after:

n = len(s)

ones_after = [0] * n

for i in range(n):

    cnt = 0

    for j in range(i+1, n):

        if s[j] == '1':

            cnt +=1

    ones_after[i] = cnt

sum_01 = 0

for i in range(n):

    if s[i] == '0':

        sum_01 += ones_after[i]

if sum_01 == required_sum:

    print(0)

    exit()

# Now, perform DP to find maximum x.

# Initialize DP.

dp = [{} for _ in range(c0 +1)]

dp[0][0] = 0

for i in range(n):

    new_dp = [{} for _ in range(c0+1)]

    for k in range(c0+1):

        current_dict = dp[k]

        for s_val in current_dict:

            current_x = current_dict[s_val]

            # Option 1: not take i

            if s_val in new_dp[k]:

                if current_x > new_dp[k][s_val]:

                    new_dp[k][s_val] = current_x

            else:

                new_dp[k][s_val] = current_x

            # Option 2: take i, if k < c0

            if k < c0:

                new_k = k+1

                new_s = s_val + ones_after[i]

                if new_s > required_sum:

                    continue  # can't exceed required_sum

                added_x = 1 if s[i] == '0' else 0

                new_x = current_x + added_x

                if new_s in new_dp[new_k]:

                    if new_x > new_dp[new_k][new_s]:

                        new_dp[new_k][new_s] = new_x

                else:

                    new_dp[new_k][new_s] = new_x

    dp = new_dp

# Find the maximum x in dp[c0].get(required_sum, ...)

max_x = dp[c0].get(required_sum, -1)

if max_x == -1:

    # Impossible, but problem says it's possible.

    pass

swaps = c0 - max_x

print(swaps)

This should handle all cases correctly.

```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Thus, the code outputs 1.

Sample 4: input 11001100 → output 2.

s = '1','1','0','0','1','1','0','0' → c0=4, c1=4. required_sum= (4*4)/2=8.

sum_01 for original:

The 0s are at positions 2,3,6,7.

ones_after for each 0:

position2: s[3] is 0, s[4] is1, s[5] is1, s[6] is0, s[7] is0 → 2 1s.

position3: s[4], s[5], s[6], s[7] → 2 1s.

position6: s[7] →0. ones_after=0.

position7: none. ones_after=0.

sum_01 = 2+2+0+0=4. required_sum=8. So not equal.

Thus, code proceeds with DP.

The required_sum is 8.

The code will compute the maximum x where selected subset of 4 positions has sum 8.

In the optimal arrangement, perhaps the 0s are placed in positions 2,3,4,5. Or something like that.

But according to the sample's output, the minimal swaps is 2.

Thus, the code will compute the maximum x such that the subset has sum 8. Then swaps =4 -x.

For example, if x is 2, swaps is 2.

Thus, the code should output 2.

Thus, the code is correct.

Thus, this is the correct approach.
