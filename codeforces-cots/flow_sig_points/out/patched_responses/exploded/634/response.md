Okay, let's see. The problem is about counting the number of subsets of problems that meet certain conditions. Let's break down the requirements.

First, the subset must have at least two problems. Then, the sum of their difficulties must be between l and r, inclusive. Also, the difference between the maximum and minimum difficulty in the subset must be at least x. 

So, how do I approach this? The constraints say that n can be up to 15. Oh right, 15 is manageable with bitmasking because 2^15 is 32768, which is a manageable number. That's a key insight here. So the plan is to iterate through all possible non-empty subsets (but check if they have at least two elements), calculate their sum, check the min and max, and see if they meet the conditions.

Wait, but the subsets with size 1 are excluded. So for each subset, first check if its size is >=2. Then, compute sum, check sum between l and r. Then compute max and min in the subset, check if their difference is >=x.

So the steps would be:

1. Generate all possible subsets of the problems (each can be represented by a bitmask where each bit indicates whether the problem is included).
2. For each subset:
   a. If the subset has less than 2 elements, skip.
   b. Calculate the sum of the elements.
   c. Check if sum is between l and r (inclusive).
   d. Find the minimum and maximum elements in the subset.
   e. Check if max - min >=x.
   f. If all conditions are met, count it.

Now, how to efficiently generate all subsets and compute their sum, min, and max?

For each bitmask from 1 to (1<<n)-1, we can iterate. But for each subset, we need to track the sum, min, and max. Since n is small (15), even O(n) per subset is acceptable. Because 15 * 32768 = 491520 operations. That's manageable within the time constraints.

So the approach is feasible.

Let's think about possible optimizations. For example, pre-sorting the array might help in quickly finding the min and max of a subset. Wait, but if the subset is sorted, then min is the first element and max is the last. But the elements in the subset can be any combination. However, when generating the subset, you can track min and max incrementally.

Alternatively, for each subset, iterate through the bits that are set and collect those elements, then compute sum, min, max. But with n up to 15, even this is manageable. Because for each subset, the number of elements is up to 15. So per subset, O(k) where k is the number of bits set. For 3e4 subsets, each with up to 15 elements, total operations are 3e4 *15 = 4.5e5, which is acceptable.

So the steps in code would be:

Read n, l, r, x.

Read the list of c's.

Initialize count to 0.

Loop over all possible bitmask from 1 to (1<<n) -1:

   For each bitmask, check the number of set bits (using bin(mask).count('1') or a bit counting function). If less than 2, skip.

   Then, collect the elements where the bit is set.

   Compute sum of those elements.

   If sum is not between l and r, skip.

   Find min and max of the subset.

   If (max - min) >=x, increment count.

So the code can be written as:

Read the input.

Then for each mask in 1..(1<<n)-1:

   count_bits = bin(mask).count('1')

   if count_bits <2: continue

   total = 0

   current_min = infinity

   current_max = -infinity

   for i in 0..n-1:

       if mask & (1<<i):

           val = c[i]

           total += val

           if val < current_min:

               current_min = val

           if val > current_max:

               current_max = val

   if total >= l and total <= r and (current_max - current_min) >=x:

       count +=1

So this should work.

But can we optimize this further? Let's think about the order of checks. For example, if the sum is already over r, we can break early. But in the current approach, we need to collect all elements, compute sum, min, max. There's no way to compute those without checking all elements in the subset. So no early breaking here. So the code is as efficient as it can be.

Now, considering the input constraints. The maximum sum can be up to 15*1e6 = 15e6. So when l and r can be up to 1e9, the sum can be 15e6, which is way below 1e9, so even if l is 1e9, but sum is 15e6, it's skipped. But that's handled correctly.

So the code should handle all cases correctly.

Now, let's check the examples.

First example input:

3 5 6 1

c = [1,2,3]

Possible subsets with size >=2:

Check all subsets. Let's see which ones meet the conditions.

Subsets:

mask 011 (elements 2 and 3): sum 5. min 2, max 3. 3-2=1 >=1. sum is 5 in 5-6. So count.

mask 101 (1 and 3): sum 4, which is below 5. So no.

mask 110 (1 and 2): sum 3. No.

mask 111: sum 6. min 1, max 3. 3-1=2 >=1. So yes.

So total 2, which matches the example.

Another example:

Third example input:

5 25 35 10

c = [10,10,20,10,20]

We need subsets of size >=2, sum between 25-35, and max - min >=10.

But the min is 10, max is 20. So max - min is 10. So any subset that contains at least one 10 and one 20, and sum between 25-35.

Possible subsets:

Each subset must have at least one 10 and one 20. Let's see:

Each 10 and 20 pair would sum to 30. Then adding others.

But other possibilities:

Like two 10s and one 20: 10+10+20=40. But 40 is over 35. So that's invalid.

Wait, let's see. The sum has to be between 25 and 35. So subsets like:

10 (from first, second, fourth) and 20 (third or fifth). But sum needs to be between 25 and 35.

So for a subset with two 10s and one 20: 10+10+20=40, which is over 35. So invalid.

Another example: a subset with one 10 and two 20s: 10+20+20=50, which is over. So invalid.

So the valid subsets are those that have exactly one 10 and one 20, but sum to between 25 and 35. Wait, but 10+20 is 30. Which is within 25-35. So that's a valid subset. So all pairs of 10 and 20, as long as the subset contains at least one 10 and at least one 20. Then, the sum is 30. So any subset that includes at least one 10 and one 20, and possibly other 10s and/or 20s as long as the sum stays within the range.

Wait, but adding more 10s would increase the sum. Let's see:

For example, a subset with two 10s and one 20: sum is 40. Which is over 35. So that's invalid. So the only valid subsets are those that have exactly one 10 and one 20, or subsets with one 10 and two 20s (sum 50, which is over), but that's invalid. Wait, maybe the example has multiple 10s and 20s but the sum is still within the range.

Wait, looking at the third example's output: 6. Let's see why.

The c array is [10,10,20,10,20]. So all possible subsets that have at least one 10 and at least one 20, and sum between 25 and 35.

Each such subset must have sum between 25 and 35. So 10+20=30 is acceptable. Also, adding more 10s or 20s could be possible, but the sum needs to stay within 25-35.

Wait, adding another 10: 10+10+20=40. That's over 35, invalid. Adding another 20: 10+20+20=50, over. So the only possible subsets are those with exactly one 10 and one 20, and sum 30. So how many such subsets are there?

Looking at the array:

There are three 10s (indices 0,1,3) and two 20s (indices 2,4).

Each pair of a 10 and a 20 gives a valid subset, and the sum is 30. So how many such pairs?

Number of 10s is 3, number of 20s is 2. So 3*2=6 possible pairs. That's the output. So each subset is a pair of one 10 and one 20. So the answer is 6, which matches the example.

So the code correctly handles this case because for each subset, even if there are multiple 10s and 20s, but the sum must be within the range and the subset must have at least one 10 and one 20 (so max - min is 10).

But wait, what if a subset has more than one 10 and one 20? Like two 10s and one 20. Then the sum is 40, which is over 35. So it's not counted. So the code correctly skips those. So the code's logic works.

Thus, the approach is correct.

Now, coding this in Python.

The code steps:

Read n, l, r, x.

Read the list c.

Sorting is not necessary, but in the code, the order doesn't matter. Because for each subset, the code checks each element in the subset.

Initialize count =0.

Loop mask from 1 to (1<<n) -1:

   bits = bin(mask).count('1')

   if bits <2: continue.

   total =0

   current_min = some big number.

   current_max = some small number.

   for i in 0 to n-1:

       if mask has bit i set:

           val = c[i]

           total += val

           if val < current_min:

               current_min = val

           if val > current_max:

               current_max = val

   if total is between l and r, and (current_max - current_min) >=x:

       count +=1

Return count.

Yes.

Now, implement this.

Now, some optimizations. For example, pre-sort the array. But in the code, it's easier to process the elements as they are. Because when you check each element in the subset, the order doesn't matter for min and max. So no need to sort.

So code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, l, r, x = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    c = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

    count =0

    for mask in range(1, 1<<n):

        bits = bin(mask).count('1')

        if bits <2:

            continue

        s =0

        min_c = float('inf')

        max_c = -float('inf')

        for i in range(n):

            if mask & (1 <<i):

                val = c[i]

                s += val

                if val < min_c:

                    min_c = val

                if val > max_c:

                    max_c = val

        if l <= s <= r and (max_c - min_c) >=x:

            count +=1

    print(count, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
4 40 50 10
10 20 30 25
""",
            "output": \
"""\
2
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Third example: the code would generate all pairs of 10 and 20. For each pair, the sum is 30, which is between 25 and 35, and max-min is 10. So each of the 3*2=6 pairs is counted. So the code returns 6.

So the code works.

Now, considering time. For n=15, 32767 masks. For each mask, up to 15 bits to check. So total operations are 32767 *15 = around 491,505 operations. Python can handle that in 0.2 seconds or less. So within the time constraints.

The memory usage is minimal, as we only store the list c and some variables. So within the 256MB limit.

So this is the correct and optimal solution.

```python
n, l, r, x = map(int, input().split())
c = list(map(int, input().split()))
count = 0

for mask in range(1, 1 << n):
    bit_count = bin(mask).count('1')
    if bit_count < 2:
        continue
    total = 0
    min_c = float('inf')
    max_c = -float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        if mask & (1 << i):
            val = c[i]
            total += val
            if val < min_c:
                min_c = val
            if val > max_c:
                max_c = val
    if l <= total <= r and (max_c - min_c) >= x:
        count += 1

print(count)
```
