Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine if string t can be formed by replacing the '*' in string s with any sequence of lowercase letters, including the empty string. Hmm. 

First, I need to understand the structure of the problem. The key points are:

- s has at most one '*' character. So there's either zero or one wildcard.
- If there's no '*', then s and t must be exactly the same.
- If there is a '*', then s is split into a prefix before the '*' and a suffix after. For t to match, it must start with the prefix, end with the suffix, and the part in between can be any (possibly empty) string of lowercase letters.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Check if s contains a '*'. If not, then compare s and t directly. If they are equal, output YES; else, NO.
2. If s has a '*', then split s into prefix and suffix. Then check if t starts with the prefix (without the '*'), ends with the suffix (without the '*'), and that the total length of prefix + suffix is <= m. Because the middle part can be any string, but the prefix and suffix have to be in t.

Wait, right. Let's think in terms of lengths. The minimal length that t can have is len(prefix) + len(suffix) - 2 (since the * replaces those two parts). Wait, no. Because the '*' can be replaced by any sequence. So the original s with '*' has a length of (prefix length) + 1 (the *) + (suffix length). When replacing the * with a string of length k, the total becomes (prefix len) + k + (suffix len). So for t to match, the length m must be >= (prefix len + suffix len) - 1 (since the * is replaced by a zero-length string, making the total len(prefix) + 0 + len(suffix) = len(prefix) + len(suffix)). Wait, no. Wait, the original s has len n, which includes the '*' once. So when we replace the '*' with a string of length k, the total len is (n -1) + k. Because the '*' is one character, replaced by k characters. So t's length m must equal (n-1) + k, where k >=0.

But for the problem, since the replacement can be any length (as long as the prefix and suffix are matched), then m must be >= (n-1) - 1 + 0? Wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, original s has len n. The * is part of s. So when the * is replaced by a string of length k, the new s (which is t) has len (n-1) +k. So m must be equal to (n-1) +k, where k can be 0 or more. Therefore, m must be >= (n-1) - 1? No, no. Because k can be zero, so the minimal possible m is (n-1) + 0 = n-1. But in this case, since the * is present in s, the original s has a * which requires that t must have a length that is at least (prefix length) + (suffix length). Because the prefix is everything before *, the suffix is everything after. So the minimal length is len(prefix) + len(suffix). For example, if s is "a*b", then the minimal t is "ab" (replace * with empty string). So len(prefix) is 1, len(suffix) is 1, total len is 2. But len(s) is 3 (a * b), so (n-1) is 2. So yes, len(t) must be >= len(prefix) + len(suffix). So, in code, when there is a *, the necessary conditions are:

- t starts with the prefix (without the *).
- t ends with the suffix (without the *).
- The length of t must be at least (prefix len + suffix len). Because the * can be replaced with a zero-length string, making the total len(prefix) + len(suffix) = (prefix len + suffix len). So m >= (prefix len + suffix len).

Wait, but len(prefix) is the number of characters before *, which is the same as the index of the * in s. Similarly, len(suffix) is the number of characters after *, which is (n-1 - star_pos). So for example, if s is "a*b", prefix is "a", suffix is "b". Then len(prefix) + len(suffix) is 2. And m must be >= 2, but also, the * replacement can be of length (m - (prefix len + suffix len)).

So steps for the case where s contains *:

Check if m >= len(prefix) + len(suffix). If not, return NO.

Then check if the first len(prefix) characters of t match the prefix.

Check if the last len(suffix) characters of t match the suffix.

If all these conditions are true, then YES. Otherwise, NO.

But wait, in the example where s is "vk*cup" and t is "vkcup", the prefix is "vk" (len 2), suffix is "cup" (len 3). So len(prefix) + len(suffix) is 5, and m is 5. So t's length is exactly 5, which is allowed. The * is replaced by an empty string, so the total length is 2 +0 +3 =5. So the code would check the first 2 characters of t ("vk") and the last 3 ("cup") which matches, so yes.

Another example: s is "code*s", which becomes prefix "code" (len4), suffix "s" (len1). Then m is 10, len(prefix)+len(suffix) is 5. So 10 >=5, yes. Then check first 4 characters of t match "code", which they do (codeforces starts with code), and last 1 character is 's' (the last character of codeforces is 's'). So yes.

If s has no *, then t must be exactly equal to s.

So the plan is:

1. Check if s contains a *.

   a. If not: compare s and t directly. If equal, YES else NO.

   b. If yes:

      i. Split into prefix and suffix.

      ii. Check if m >= len(prefix) + len(suffix). If not, return NO.

      iii. Check the first part of t (prefix length) matches prefix.

      iv. Check the last part of t (suffix length) matches suffix.

      v. If all checks pass, YES else NO.

Now, how to handle edge cases.

Edge case 1: s is "*". Then prefix is empty, suffix is empty. So len(prefix) + len(suffix) =0. So m can be any length (as long as it's >=0). So any t would match. So the answer is YES.

Edge case 2: s has a * but the prefix and/or suffix are longer than t. For example, s is "abc*d", t is "abd". Then len(prefix) is 3, suffix is 1. So 3+1=4. m is 3 <4, so output is NO.

Another edge case: prefix is empty. For example, s is "*abc". Then len(prefix) is 0, len(suffix) is 3. So m must be >=3. And t must end with "abc".

Similarly, if suffix is empty (s ends with *), then t must start with prefix, and the rest can be anything.

Now, code steps:

First, check if s contains a '*':

count = s.count('*')

if count ==0:

   return 'YES' if s == t else 'NO'

else:

   assert count ==1 (since the problem says s has at most one)

   split into prefix and suffix: split at the *.

   prefix = s.split('*')[0]

   suffix = s.split('*')[1]

   required_length = len(prefix) + len(suffix)

   if m < required_length:

       return 'NO'

   # check prefix part

   if t.startswith(prefix) is False:

       return 'NO'

   # check suffix part. The suffix must be the last len(suffix) characters of t.

   if t.endswith(suffix) is False:

       return 'NO'

   return 'YES'

But wait, what if the * is in the middle, and the prefix and suffix are such that in t, after the prefix and before the suffix, there's some characters? Like in the first example, the * is replaced by 'force', which is the middle part. But our code checks that the prefix is at the start and suffix is at the end. Which is correct.

But in code, the checking of startswith and endswith must be done for the exact lengths. For example, if prefix is 'a', then the first 1 character of t must be 'a'. Similarly, suffix of length 2 requires last 2 characters of t to match.

So in code:

pre_len = len(prefix)

suf_len = len(suffix)

Then, check t[:pre_len] == prefix and t[-suf_len:] == suffix (if suf_len>0, else t ends with suffix which is empty).

But in Python, if suf_len is 0, t[-0:] is an empty string, which is correct.

But let's code this properly.

So code steps:

Read n, m.

Read s and t.

if '*' not in s:

   if s == t: print YES else NO

else:

   star_pos = s.index('*')

   prefix = s[:star_pos]

   suffix = s[star_pos+1:]

   pre_len = len(prefix)

   suf_len = len(suffix)

   if m < pre_len + suf_len:

       print("NO")

   else:

       if t[:pre_len] != prefix:

           print("NO")

       elif t[-suf_len:] != suffix:

           print("NO")

       else:

           print("YES")

Wait, but what if the suffix is empty? Then t[-0:] is an empty string. So in that case, the endswith check is always True. Which is correct.

Similarly, if the prefix is empty (e.g., s starts with *), then the startswith check passes as t[:0] is empty string.

Yes, this should handle all cases.

Testing sample inputs:

First sample:

s = "code*s", split into prefix "code", suffix "s". len 4+1=5. m=10 >=5. Check first 4 chars of t (codeforces) is "code". Last 1 char is 's' (yes). So YES.

Second sample: s is "vk*cup" → split into "vk" and "cup". m=5. 2+3=5. So check t starts with "vk", ends with "cup". t is "vkcup" → starts with "vk", ends with "cup". So yes.

Third sample: s has no *, s is "v", t is "k". So check if equal: no. Output NO.

Fourth sample: s is "gfgf*gfgf", split into "gfgf" and "gfgf". required_length is 4+4=8. m=6 <8 → output NO.

Another test case: s is "*", t is anything. Then required_length is 0+0=0. m can be anything >=0. So check if t starts with "" and ends with "". So yes. Output YES.

Another case: s is "a*", prefix "a", suffix "". required_length is 1+0=1. m must be >=1. Then t must start with 'a'. So for m=5, t is "abcde", then yes.

Another edge case: s is "a*b", t is "ab". required_length is 1+1=2, which equals m=2. Check first 1 char is 'a', last 1 is 'b'. Yes.

So the code seems to handle these cases.

Now, considering the constraints. The maximum n and m are 2e5. So the code must be O(n + m) time, which is acceptable.

In Python, string slicing and comparisons can be O(k), where k is the length of the slice. So for the code:

- Checking t starts with prefix is O(len(prefix)), which is up to 2e5.

Same for the suffix. But since len(prefix) + len(suffix) can be up to 2e5, and m can be 2e5, the code's time complexity is O(n + m), which is acceptable for 1 second time limit.

But wait, in Python, the startswith and endswith methods can be O(k) where k is the length of the substring being checked. So for the code, when the code checks t[:pre_len] == prefix, that's O(pre_len) time. Similarly for the suffix.

So in the worst case, pre_len is 2e5, and same for suffix. So the code would take O(2e5 + 2e5) time, which is manageable.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize. Wait, no. Because to check if the first pre_len characters of t match the prefix, we have to compare each character. So there's no way around O(pre_len) time.

But for Python, given that the input is up to 2e5, and each of these checks is O(n), which is acceptable.

So the code should work.

Now, code implementation.

Read n and m from input.

Read s and t.

Check if '*' in s:

   if not, compare s and t. If equal, output YES else NO.

else:

   split into prefix and suffix.

   check required_length = len(prefix) + len(suffix). if m < required_length, output NO.

   check t starts with prefix → t[:len(prefix)] == prefix.

   check t ends with suffix → t[-len(suffix):] == suffix (but if len(suffix) is zero, then t[-0:] is empty string, which matches).

   if all conditions met, output YES else NO.

But in code, in Python, for suffix, if len(suffix) is zero, then t[-0:] is an empty string. So, when suffix is empty, we need to check that the suffix is the empty string, which t's end of length zero is empty. So that's correct.

So code:

Read n, m = map(int, input().split())

s = input().strip()

t = input().strip()

if '*' not in s:

    print("YES" if s == t else "NO")

else:

    star_pos = s.index('*')

    prefix = s[:star_pos]

    suffix = s[star_pos+1:]

    req = len(prefix) + len(suffix)

    if m < req:

        print("NO")

    else:

        # Check prefix and suffix

        # Check startswith prefix

        ok = True

        # Check first len(prefix) chars of t match prefix

        if len(prefix) >0 and t[:len(prefix)] != prefix:

            ok = False

        # Check last len(suffix) chars of t match suffix

        if len(suffix) >0 and t[-len(suffix):] != suffix:

            ok = False

        print("YES" if ok else "NO")

Wait, but when len(prefix) is zero (i.e., the * is at the start of s), then prefix is empty. So t[:0] is empty, which equals the prefix. So no need to check that. But in the code, if len(prefix) >0 and the first part doesn't match, then set ok to False. So if len(prefix) is zero, that condition is skipped. Similarly for suffix.

So the code correctly handles cases where the prefix or suffix is empty.

Testing the case where s is "*", then prefix is empty, suffix is empty. req = 0. m can be any >=0. So even m=0, but t is empty. Then:

t starts with prefix (empty), ends with suffix (empty). So output is YES.

Another example: s is "a*", t is "a". Then prefix is "a", suffix is empty. req is 1+0=1. m=1 >=1. Check first 1 character of t is "a", which it is. Suffix is empty, so no check. So output YES.

Another example: s is "*a", t is "ba". prefix is empty, suffix is "a". m=2 >=0+1=1. Check t starts with empty (yes), ends with "a". So yes.

Yes, code seems correct.

Now, let's test the third sample input:

s is "v", which has no *. t is "k". So code compares s and t. Not equal. Output NO.

Fourth sample: s is "gfgf*gfgf" → split into "gfgf" and "gfgf". req len is 8. t has len 6 <8 → output NO.

Yes.

So the code handles all the sample inputs correctly.

So this should be the correct approach.
