Okay, let's see. The problem is to generate a sentence based on the number of layers n. Each layer alternates between hate and love. The first is hate, second love, third hate again, and so on. So for n=1, it's just "I hate it". For n=2, "I hate that I love it". For n=3, "I hate that I love that I hate it". So each layer adds a "that" followed by the next feeling, except the last one which ends with "it".

So the approach should be to build the sentence step by step. Let's think about how to construct this string. 

For each layer from 1 to n, we alternate between 'hate' and 'love'. So for i from 1 to n:
- if i is odd, it's hate
- if even, love

But then, between each of these, except the last one, we add "that". So for each of the first n-1 layers, we append "I [hate/love] that ", and the last one is "I [hate/love] it".

So for example, n=3:
Layer 1: I hate that 
Layer 2: I love that 
Layer 3: I hate it

Combined: "I hate that I love that I hate it"

So the plan is to generate a list of the phrases for each layer, then join them with spaces, but each except the last ends with "that" instead of "it".

Wait, maybe it's easier to create a list of the parts. Let's think:

Each part (except the last) is "I hate" or "I love" followed by " that". The last part is "I hate" or "I love" followed by " it".

So for n layers, there are n parts. The first n-1 parts are "I [feeling] that" and the nth is "I [feeling] it".

So for each part from 1 to n, determine whether it's hate or love. Then build the list of strings for each part.

So for i in 1..n:

if i is odd, feeling is 'hate', else 'love'

then, if i is not the last (i <n), append "I [feeling] that". else append "I [feeling] it".

Then, join all these parts with spaces.

Yes, that makes sense.

So how to implement this in Python.

Read n from input.

Initialize a list of strings.

Loop from 1 to n:

for each i, check if it's even or odd.

if i % 2 == 1: feeling = 'hate'

else: 'love'

then, if i is not n (i <n), add "I " + feeling + " that"

else add "I " + feeling + " it"

Then, join all the parts with spaces.

Wait, but when you have "that" followed by "I", that's correct. Because "hate that I love..." etc. So each part is like "I hate that", but when we join all parts, it's "I hate that I love that I hate it".

Yes. So the code can be written as:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    parts = []

    for i in range(1, n+1):

        if i % 2 == 1:

            feeling = 'hate'

        else:

            feeling = 'love'

        if i < n:

            parts.append(f"I {feeling} that")

        else:

            parts.append(f"I {feeling} it")

    result = ' '.join(parts)

    print(result, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
2
""",
            "output": \
"""\
I hate that I love it
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Testing against sample input 2.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    parts = []

    for i in range(1, n+1):

        if i % 2 == 1:

            feeling = 'hate'

        else:

            feeling = 'love'

        if i < n:

            parts.append(f"I {feeling} that")

        else:

            parts.append(f"I {feeling} it")

    result = ' '.join(parts)

    print(result, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
3
""",
            "output": \
"""\
I hate that I love that I hate it
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Test case 3: n=3.

i=1: hate. append "I hate that".

i=2: love. append "I love that".

i=3: hate. append "I hate it".

Join â†’ "I hate that I love that I hate it". Correct.

So this code should work.

Now, considering the constraints: n is up to 100, which is very small. So even with a loop of 100 iterations, it's negligible. So the code is optimal in terms of time and space. No need for any optimization beyond this approach.

The code is straightforward and efficient. It uses O(n) time and space, which is acceptable given the input size. So this should be the correct approach.

```python
n = int(input())
parts = []
for i in range(1, n+1):
    feeling = 'hate' if i % 2 else 'love'
    parts.append(f"I {feeling} {'that' if i < n else 'it'}")
print(' '.join(parts))
```
