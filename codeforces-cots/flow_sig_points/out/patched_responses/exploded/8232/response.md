Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about counting the number of rectangles in a matrix where each element is the product of the i-th and j-th digits of the string s. The sum of all elements in the rectangle must equal a given value a. 

Hmm, first, let's understand the structure of the matrix. The matrix B is such that each element B[i][j] = s_i * s_j. So the matrix is formed by the product of the digits in the string. 

Wait, a rectangle in this matrix is defined by selecting a range of rows (from x to y) and a range of columns (from z to t). The sum of all elements in this rectangle must equal a. Our goal is to count all such possible rectangles for a given a and s.

Let me think about how to compute the sum of a rectangle. Suppose we have a rectangle from row x to y and column z to t. The sum would be the sum over i from x to y, sum over j from z to t of (s_i * s_j). 

But this can be factored. The sum is equal to (sum_{i=x to y} s_i) * (sum_{j=z to t} s_j). Because when you expand the product, each term s_i s_j is multiplied once for each pair (i,j) in the ranges. So the sum is the product of the sum of rows and the sum of columns. 

Oh right! So the sum of the rectangle is the product of two sums: one for the row range and one for the column range. So, the problem reduces to finding all pairs of row intervals and column intervals where the product of their sums equals a. 

So for each possible interval of rows (x, y), compute the sum of s[x..y], and for each interval of columns (z, t), compute the sum of s[z..t]. Then, the number of rectangle pairs is the number of (row_sum, col_sum) pairs where row_sum * col_sum = a. 

But how do we compute this efficiently?

First, let's precompute all possible row sums and column sums. Since the matrix is based on the same string s for both rows and columns, the row intervals and column intervals are the same. So the possible row sums are the same as the possible column sums. 

Wait, but the row and column in the matrix B are determined by the same digits. So for example, row 0 in B is s_0 * s_0, s_0 * s_1, etc. So the sum for a row interval (x,y) in the rows of B is sum_{i=x to y} sum_{j= ... } of s_i s_j. Wait, no. Wait, the rectangle is a rectangle in the matrix. So when we select rows x to y and columns z to t, the elements are all (i,j) where x ≤ i ≤ y and z ≤ j ≤ t. So each element in the rectangle is s_i * s_j. So the sum over all elements is sum_{i=x}^y sum_{j=z}^t s_i s_j. Which factors into (sum_{i=x}^y s_i) * (sum_{j=z}^t s_j). 

Yes. So the sum is the product of the sum of the row interval and the sum of the column interval. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of pairs (sum_row, sum_col) such that sum_row * sum_col = a, multiplied by the number of times each sum_row and sum_col occurs.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute all possible subarray sums of the digits in s. Let's call this list of sums as freq, where freq[k] is the number of subarrays that sum to k.

2. Then, the total number of rectangles is the sum over all possible pairs (k1, k2) where k1 * k2 = a of freq[k1] * freq[k2].

But how to compute all possible subarray sums efficiently?

The digits are up to 4000 in length. For each possible subarray (i.e., contiguous subsequence) of s, compute its sum. Then count the frequency of each sum. 

The problem here is that the number of possible subarrays is O(n^2), which for n=4000 is about 16 million. That's manageable, but we need an efficient way to compute all possible subarray sums and their frequencies. 

But even 16 million is manageable. For n=4000, the total possible subarrays are 4000*4001/2 = 8,002,000. So about 8 million. That's feasible. 

So first, we need to compute all possible subarray sums of the digits string, count their frequencies, and then compute the product of frequencies for pairs that multiply to a.

But let's think about the possible sum values. Each digit is between 0 and 9. So the maximum possible sum for a subarray of length 4000 is 9 * 4000 = 36,000. So the possible sums can be up to 36,000. So the frequencies can be stored in a dictionary or a list where the key is the sum and the value is the count.

So the plan is:

- Compute all subarray sums of s, count their frequencies. Let this be a dictionary cnt.

- Then, for the answer, we need to find all pairs (k1, k2) such that k1 * k2 = a, and multiply the counts cnt[k1] * cnt[k2], and sum all these products.

But there's a special case when a is zero. Because if a is zero, then either k1 is zero and k2 is anything, or k2 is zero and k1 is anything. But wait, no: the product k1 * k2 must be zero. So either k1 is zero, or k2 is zero. So in that case, the total is the number of pairs where either k1 is zero and k2 is any sum (including zero), plus the number of pairs where k2 is zero and k1 is any sum. But wait, that's double-counting the case where both are zero. So the correct formula for a=0 is: (number of k1 that are zero) * (total possible k2) + (number of k2 that are zero) * (total possible k1) - (number of k1 zero) * (number of k2 zero). Because when both are zero, they are counted in both terms, so subtract once. But another way to think: the total is (cnt_zero) * total_sums + (total_sums) * cnt_zero - cnt_zero^2. But this can be simplified to cnt_zero * (2 * total_sums - cnt_zero). Alternatively, the number of pairs where k1 is zero or k2 is zero. Let's see:

For a=0, the possible pairs are (0, x) for any x, and (x, 0) for any x. But when x is zero, the pair (0,0) is counted in both terms, leading to double-counting. So total pairs is cnt_zero * total_sums + cnt_zero * total_sums - cnt_zero^2. So that's 2 * cnt_zero * total_sums - (cnt_zero)^2. 

Alternatively, the sum is (cnt_zero) * (number of all possible sums in k2) + (number of all possible sums in k1) * cnt_zero) - (cnt_zero)^2. Because when both are zero, it's counted in both terms. So subtract the overlap once.

But perhaps a better way is to note that for a=0, the valid pairs are all (k1, k2) where k1 * k2 = 0. So either k1 is zero OR k2 is zero. So the total number is the number of pairs where k1 is zero plus the number of pairs where k2 is zero minus the number of pairs where both are zero (to avoid double-counting).

So:

sum = (count_zero * total) + (total * count_zero) - (count_zero * count_zero)

Which is 2 * count_zero * total - count_zero^2.

But total is the total number of possible sums (i.e., the sum of all frequencies in cnt, which is equal to the number of possible subarrays). Because each subarray sum is counted once in cnt. So total_subs = n*(n+1)/2, but maybe some sums are the same. Wait, the sum of all frequencies in cnt is exactly the total number of subarrays, which is n*(n+1)/2. So for the a=0 case:

total_pairs = (cnt_zero * total_subs) + (cnt_zero * total_subs) - (cnt_zero * cnt_zero)

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again. For a=0, the product k1 * k2 must be zero. So either k1 is zero or k2 is zero. So the number of pairs is (number of k1 where k1=0) multiplied by (number of possible k2) plus (number of k2 where k2=0) multiplied by (number of possible k1) minus (number of pairs where both k1 and k2 are zero) to avoid double-counting. 

But the number of possible k2 is the sum of all frequencies (total_subs), and same for k1. So:

ans = cnt_zero * total_subs + cnt_zero * total_subs - cnt_zero * cnt_zero

Because the first term counts all pairs where k1 is zero (regardless of k2), the second term counts all pairs where k2 is zero (including when k1 is zero), but then we subtract the cases where both are zero since they were counted twice.

Alternatively, for a=0, the answer is (count_zero * total_subs) + (count_zero * (total_subs - count_zero)). Because first term counts all pairs where k1 is zero (including when k2 is zero), and the second term counts all pairs where k2 is zero and k1 is not zero.

Yes, that's right. Because (count_zero * total_subs) includes all pairs where k1 is zero (including k2 zero or not). Then, for k2 being zero but k1 not zero, it's (total_subs - count_zero) * count_zero. So the total is count_zero * total_subs + (total_subs - count_zero) * count_zero = count_zero * (total_subs + total_subs - count_zero) ) = count_zero * (2 * total_subs - count_zero). 

Which is the same as the previous formula. So for a=0, the answer is count_zero * (2 * total_subs - count_zero).

But how do we compute this?

So the steps are:

1. Precompute all subarray sums of the digits in s, count the frequency of each sum. Let's call this cnt.

2. Compute the total number of subarrays, which is total_subs = n*(n+1)/2. Or sum of all cnt.values().

3. If a is zero:

   ans = cnt.get(0, 0) * (2 * total_subs - cnt.get(0, 0))

4. Else:

   Iterate over all keys k1 in cnt. For each k1, check if k1 divides a. If a % k1 == 0, then k2 = a /k1. Then the contribution is cnt[k1] * cnt.get(k2, 0). Sum all these contributions.

But wait, in this case, when a is non-zero, we have to consider pairs (k1, k2) where k1 *k2 = a. However, if k1 is zero, then a must be zero. But since a is non-zero here, so in that case, any k1 or k2 that is zero cannot contribute. So for a non-zero, we can ignore any k1 that is zero.

So for a non-zero, the code would be:

ans = 0

for k1 in cnt:

   if k1 ==0:

       continue

   if a %k1 !=0:

       continue

   k2 = a//k1

   ans += cnt[k1] * cnt.get(k2, 0)

But need to check that k1 and k2 are both non-zero (since a is non-zero). Because if a is non-zero and k1 is zero, then k2 would have to be a/0 which is undefined, but the code skips k1=0. So that's handled.

So the code for a non-zero is correct.

Now the problem is to compute the cnt dictionary efficiently.

To compute all possible subarray sums, we can use a prefix sum array. Let's see:

The digits are s_0, s_1, ..., s_{n-1}

Compute prefix_sum array where prefix_sum[i] is the sum of the first i digits (prefix_sum[0] =0, prefix_sum[1] = s_0, prefix_sum[2] = s_0 +s_1, etc.)

Then, the sum of digits from index i to j (exclusive) is prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i].

So for all possible subarrays, i ranges from 0 to j-1, for each j from 1 to n.

So for each j, we can compute all possible i from 0 to j-1, and calculate prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i], then count the frequency.

This is O(n^2) time. For n=4e3, 4e3 *4e3 =16e6 operations, which is acceptable.

But in Python, 16 million operations are manageable, but we need to optimize as much as possible.

So, let's code this:

Initialize a dictionary cnt.

Compute the prefix_sum array.

Then for each j in 1..n:

   current_sum = prefix_sum[j]

   for i in 0..j-1:

       sum_ = current_sum - prefix_sum[i]

       cnt[sum_] +=1

But this is O(n^2) time, which for n=4000 is 16 million steps. But in Python, loops can be slow. So this may not be feasible. Wait, but 16 million steps in Python can take around 1-2 seconds, but given that the time limit is 1 second, this might be tight. So we need a better way.

Wait, but for each j, the sum is current_sum - prefix_sum[i]. So for each j, we can compute all possible sums by subtracting prefix_sum[i] for i <j from the current_sum. So for each j, the possible sum is current_sum - prefix_sum[i], which is the same as (current_sum) + (-prefix_sum[i]). So for each j, the sum is the current_sum (prefix_sum[j]) minus all previous prefix_sum[i] where i ranges from 0 to j-1.

So, for j fixed, the sum is prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i], for i from 0 to j-1. So the sum is equal to the sum of elements from i to j-1 (since prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] is the sum of s[i] to s[j-1]).

Wait, maybe I confused the indices here. Let's clarify:

prefix_sum is 0-based. So prefix_sum[0] =0.

prefix_sum[1] = s[0]

prefix_sum[2] = s[0] + s[1]

...

prefix_sum[n] = sum of s[0..n-1]

So the sum of s[i..j] (inclusive) is prefix_sum[j+1] - prefix_sum[i].

Wait, no. For example, i=0 and j=0 (sum s[0]), the sum is prefix_sum[1] - prefix_sum[0] = s[0]. Yes.

So the sum of the subarray from index i to j (inclusive) is prefix_sum[j+1] - prefix_sum[i].

So when j is fixed as j+1 in the prefix_sum array, the code for each j (from 1 to n) represents the sum up to the j-th element. Then, the sum of the subarray starting at i and ending at j-1 (since j is the end index in the prefix_sum) would be prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i].

So for j in 1 to n, the possible i's are 0 to j-1.

So for each j, the subarrays are of the form [i, j-1] in the original array. So the length is j-1 -i +1 = j -i.

But the code as described would generate all possible subarrays. So for each j in 1..n, we look back to i from 0 to j-1, compute prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i], which is the sum of the subarray from i to j-1.

So this approach is O(n^2) time, which is acceptable for n=4e3. But in Python, even 16 million operations can take some time. So is there a way to optimize this?

Hmm. Let's think about the code.

An alternative approach is to precompute the prefix sums, then for each j, iterate through all i from 0 to j-1, compute the sum, and update the frequency count.

But in Python, using a dictionary to count frequencies may be slow. So perhaps using a list to track the sums for each j and then updating a Counter or defaultdict(int) may be better.

Wait, but even with that, for each j, we need to loop j times (from 0 to j-1). For j up to 4000, j can be up to 4000. So for j=4000, the inner loop runs 4000 times. So the total number of iterations is 4000*4001/2 = 8,002,000. Which is about 8 million. That's manageable.

But even that, in Python, can take some time. So perhaps using a defaultdict and precomputing the prefix sums, and then for each j, adding all the possible sums to the counter.

So here's the plan:

- Precompute the prefix_sum array.

- Initialize a defaultdict(int) called cnt.

- Then for each j in range(1, n+1):

   current_sum = prefix_sum[j]

   for i in range(j):

       sum_sub = current_sum - prefix_sum[i]

       cnt[sum_sub] +=1

But this is O(n^2) time and O(n^2) space for the cnt, but in practice, since the sum can be up to 36,000, the number of keys in the cnt is manageable.

But for n=4e3, this code would loop 8e6 times, which in Python is manageable. Let's see: in Python, a loop of 8e6 iterations may take about 0.8 seconds (assuming each iteration takes 100 nanoseconds, which is a rough estimate). But considering that each iteration involves a subtraction and a dictionary update, it's possible that this would take around 1 second, which is within the time limit.

But perhaps we can optimize this. Since the prefix_sum array is a list of integers, and for each j, the sum_sub is current_sum minus prefix_sum[i], which is the sum of elements from i to j-1.

But perhaps using a list to compute the sum for each j and i, and then using a Counter to count the frequencies.

Alternatively, perhaps using a list to collect all the sum_sub values and then using collections.defaultdict to count them. But that's not possible as the sum_sub is computed per j and i. So the code as described is the way to go.

So the code for the first part is:

Compute prefix sums:

s = input().strip()

digits = [int(c) for c in s]

n = len(digits)

prefix_sum = [0] * (n +1)

for i in range(n):

    prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + digits[i]

Then, compute cnt:

from collections import defaultdict

cnt = defaultdict(int)

for j in range(1, n+1):

    current = prefix_sum[j]

    for i in range(j):

        sum_sub = current - prefix_sum[i]

        cnt[sum_sub] +=1

Now, after this, we have the frequency counts for all possible subarray sums.

Once we have cnt, we can compute the answer based on whether a is zero or not.

So for a=0:

count_zero = cnt.get(0, 0)

total_subs = n * (n+1) // 2

ans = count_zero * (2 * total_subs - count_zero)

But wait, the total_subs is the total number of subarrays, which is exactly the sum of all the counts in cnt. Because each subarray is counted exactly once. So sum(cnt.values()) equals total_subs. But for a=0, in the code above, when j ranges from 1 to n, and i from 0 to j-1, the total number of subarrays is sum_{j=1 to n} j = n*(n+1)/2. Which is indeed the case.

So the code for a=0 is correct.

For a !=0:

We need to find all pairs (k1, k2) where k1 *k2 = a, and multiply their counts.

But how to efficiently iterate through possible k1?

We can loop through each k1 in cnt's keys. For each k1, if k1 is zero, skip (since a is non-zero). Else, check if a is divisible by k1. If yes, then k2 = a//k1. Then, add cnt[k1] * cnt.get(k2, 0) to the answer.

But in this case, since the problem allows (k1, k2) and (k2, k1) as different pairs if k1 !=k2. For example, if k1=2 and k2=3, and a=6, then when we loop through k1=2, we get a contribution of cnt[2] * cnt[3]. Then when k1=3, if a=6 is still divisible by k1=3, then k2=2, and we add cnt[3] * cnt[2]. Which counts the same pairs twice. But wait, in the problem statement, each rectangle is determined by a row interval and a column interval. So each pair (k1, k2) is considered once, where k1 is the row sum and k2 is the column sum. So the total number is the product of the counts of k1 and k2. So for example, if there are 3 row intervals with sum 2 and 4 column intervals with sum 3, that contributes 3*4=12 rectangles. Then, if there are 2 row intervals with sum 3 and 5 column intervals with sum 2, that's another 2*5=10. So total 22. So the code as described, which counts all possible (k1, k2) pairs where k1*k2=a, is correct, even if k1 and k2 are swapped.

So the code as described would correctly count all such pairs, even if k1 and k2 are different but their product is a.

So the code for a !=0 is correct.

So putting this all together:

Read a from input, then the string s.

Compute the cnt as described.

If a is zero, compute as per the a=0 case.

Else, compute by checking each k1 in cnt, skipping zero, and adding cnt[k1] * cnt.get(k2,0) where k2=a//k1 and a mod k1 is zero.

But there's a corner case when k1 is a divisor of a and k2 is a valid sum.

Now, some optimizations:

For a non-zero, when iterating through the keys in cnt, we can avoid checking all keys. For example, if a is very large (up to 1e9), but the possible sum values are up to 36,000, then checking each key in cnt (which could have up to 36,000 unique sums) is manageable. Because 36,000 iterations are trivial.

So in code:

a = int(input())

s = input().strip()

digits = [int(c) for c in s]

n = len(digits)

prefix_sum = [0] * (n +1)

for i in range(n):

    prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + digits[i]

from collections import defaultdict

cnt = defaultdict(int)

for j in range(1, n+1):

    current = prefix_sum[j]

    for i in range(j):

        sum_sub = current - prefix_sum[i]

        cnt[sum_sub] +=1

if a ==0:

    count_zero = cnt.get(0, 0)

    total_subs = n * (n+1) //2

    ans = count_zero * (2 * total_subs - count_zero)

else:

    ans =0

    for k1 in cnt:

        if k1 ==0:

            continue

        if a % k1 !=0:

            continue

        k2 = a //k1

        ans += cnt[k1] * cnt.get(k2, 0)

print(ans)

But let's test this code against the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

10

12345

The digits are [1,2,3,4,5]

n=5.

The possible subarray sums are computed as follows.

But let's compute the prefix sums:

prefix_sum[0] =0

prefix_sum[1] =1

prefix_sum[2] =1+2=3

prefix_sum[3] =3+3=6

prefix_sum[4] =6+4=10

prefix_sum[5] =10+5=15

For each j from 1 to 5:

j=1:

i ranges from 0 to 0.

sum_sub = prefix_sum[1] - prefix_sum[0] =1-0=1. cnt[1] +=1.

j=2:

i=0: sum_sub=3-0=3. cnt[3] +=1.

i=1: sum_sub=3-1=2. cnt[2] +=1.

j=3:

i=0: 6-0=6.

i=1:6-1=5.

i=2:6-3=3.

So cnt[6] +=1, cnt[5] +=1, cnt[3] +=1.

j=4:

i ranges from 0 to3.

sums are 10-0=10, 10-1=9, 10-3=7, 10-6=4. So cnt[10] +=1, 9,7,4.

j=5:

i from 0 to4.

sums are 15-0=15, 15-1=14, 15-3=12, 15-6=9, 15-10=5.

So all subarrays and their sums:

Looking for all possible sums:

But to save time, perhaps the code will count correctly. Then the cnt will have all the subarray sums with their frequencies.

For example, the sum 10 occurs once (the sum of digits 1-4, which is 1+2+3+4=10). But wait, when j=4 (prefix_sum[4] =10), the subarrays are from i=0 to 3 (since j=4, the sum is prefix_sum[4] - prefix_sum[i] for i<4). So when i=0, sum is 10-0=10 (digits 0-3 inclusive). So yes, sum 10 occurs once.

Then, for the sample input a=10, the code will look for all pairs (k1, k2) where k1 *k2 =10.

The possible k1 values in cnt must be divisors of 10. Let's see what possible sums can be in cnt.

Looking at the digits 1,2,3,4,5:

Possible subarray sums:

sum of 1: 1.

sum of 2: 2.

sum of 3: 3.

sum of 4:4.

sum of 5:5.

sum of 1+2=3.

sum of 2+3=5.

sum of 3+4=7.

sum of 4+5=9.

sum of 1+2+3=6.

sum of 2+3+4=9.

sum of 3+4+5=12.

sum of 1+2+3+4=10.

sum of 2+3+4+5=14.

sum of 1+2+3+4+5=15.

And other possible sums.

Wait, but in reality, the code counts all possible subarrays. So for the digits [1,2,3,4,5], the possible subarrays are all possible contiguous sequences. For example:

The subarray [1,2] sum 3.

[2,3] sum 5.

[3,4] sum7.

[4,5] sum9.

[1,2,3,4] sum 10.

So in the cnt, the sum 10 appears once.

Other possible sums:

sum 3 can be from [1,2], [3].

sum 5 can be from [5], [2,3], [1,2,3,4,5] (sum 15, but that's the sum of the entire array).

Wait, let's recompute all possible subarrays and their sums:

For the array [1,2,3,4,5], the subarrays are:

Length 1:

1 (sum1), 2 (sum2),3 (sum3),4 (sum4),5 (sum5).

Length 2:

1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+4=7,4+5=9.

Length 3:

1+2+3=6, 2+3+4=9,3+4+5=12.

Length4:

1+2+3+4=10, 2+3+4+5=14.

Length5: 15.

So the sums are:

1,2,3,4,5,3,5,7,9,6,9,12,10,14,15.

So their frequencies:

sum 1:1

sum2:1

sum3:2 (from [1,2] and [3])

sum4:1

sum5:2 (from [5] and [2,3])

sum7:1

sum9:2 (from [4,5] and [2,3,4])

sum6:1

sum12:1

sum10:1

sum14:1

sum15:1

Wait, but according to the code, for each j in 1 to 5, and i from 0 to j-1, the code counts all possible sums.

For example, when j=3 (sum of the first 3 digits:6), the possible i's are 0,1,2.

sums are 6-0=6 (digits 0-2: sum 1+2+3=6).

6-1=5 (digits 1-2: sum 2+3=5).

6-3=3 (digits 2-2: sum3).

So in this case, sum3 is counted once here.

But when j=2 (sum 3):

i=0: sum3.

i=1: sum3-1=2.

So sum3 is counted once here, sum2 once.

So for sum3, the code counts it twice (from j=2, i=0 and j=3, i=2).

So the total sum3 is two occurrences.

Similarly, sum5 occurs in j=2 (sum5 is 5? No. Wait, j=3, i=1: sum is 6-1=5 (digits 1-2: 2+3=5). Also, j=4, i=4 (no, wait j=4 is prefix_sum[4]=10. i ranges from 0-3. For i=3: sum 10-6=4 (digits 3-3:4).

Wait, perhaps it's better to just rely on the code to count correctly.

In the code's cnt, for this sample input, the sum 5 occurs in:

- j=2, i=1 (sum 2)

- j=3, i=1 (sum5)

- j=5, i=4 (sum5).

Wait, j=5 is prefix_sum[5] =15. i ranges from 0-4.

i=4: sum 15 -10=5 (digits 4-4:5).

So sum5 is from:

- j=2, i=1: sum2 (digits 1-1:2).

No, wait j=2 is prefix_sum[2]=3. i=0: sum3-0=3 (digits 0-1:1+2=3).

i=1: sum3-1=2 (digits 1-1:2).

So sum5 comes from j=3, i=1 (sum5, digits 1-2:2+3=5) and j=5, i=4 (sum5, digits4-4:5). So sum5 occurs twice.

But wait, in the code's cnt, sum5 is counted twice.

But when we have the code's cnt, the sum5 will have a frequency of 2.

Similarly, sum3 occurs in j=2, i=0 (sum3), j=3, i=2 (sum3), j=1, i=0 (sum1), etc.

Wait, perhaps the code's cnt for sum3 is 2.

But in any case, when a=10, the code will look for pairs (k1, k2) where k1 *k2=10.

So possible k1 values in the sample are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,14,15, etc.

Looking for divisors of 10. So possible k1 could be 1,2,5,10.

So for each k1 in cnt that is a divisor of 10:

Check if a mod k1 is zero.

For example:

k1=1: a/k1=10. Check if 10 is in cnt. So cnt[1] * cnt[10].

k1=2: a/k1=5. cnt[2] * cnt[5].

k1=5: a/k1=2. cnt[5] * cnt[2].

k1=10: a/k1=1. cnt[10] * cnt[1].

Also, possible k1 could be 10, but is 10 present in cnt?

In the sample input, there is a subarray [1,2,3,4] (sum10), so yes, cnt[10] is 1.

So the code will compute:

For k1=1:

contribution is cnt[1] * cnt[10] =1 *1=1.

k1=2: contribution is cnt[2] * cnt[5] =1 *2=2.

k1=5: contribution is cnt[5] * cnt[2] =2 *1=2.

k1=10: contribution is 1 *1=1.

Additionally, any other divisors of 10? Like 10's factors could be 1,2,5,10. Are there any other k1 in cnt that are divisors of 10?

For example, if there's a sum of 5, then 5 is a divisor. So yes.

So total contribution is 1+2+2+1=6, which matches the sample output.

So the code works for this case.

Another sample:

Input:

16

439873893693495623498263984765

Output:40

But without knowing the exact breakdown, it's hard to test, but the code should handle it.

Now, possible optimizations in the code:

In Python, using a defaultdict can be slower than using a regular dictionary. So perhaps precomputing the prefix sums, and for each j, precompute the current_sum and then loop i from 0 to j-1, and increment the counts.

But in practice, for n=4000, this code may work within the time limit.

But perhaps the code can be optimized by precomputing the prefix_sum once and then using a list for the counts, since the maximum possible sum is 9*4000=36,000. So a list of size 36001 (sum can be up to 36000) can be used. 

But using a list is faster than a dictionary. For example:

sum_counts = [0] * (max_sum +1)

But the problem is that the possible sum can be up to 36,000. So for each sum_sub, which can be between 0 (if all digits are zero) and 36,000, we can represent it as an array.

But first, we need to compute the maximum possible sum. For the given s, the sum can be up to 9*4000=36,000. So the array can be of size 36001.

So the code can be modified as follows:

max_possible_sum = 9 * len(digits)

sum_counts = [0] * (max_possible_sum +1)

Then, for each sum_sub in the loops:

sum_counts[sum_sub] +=1

This would avoid dictionary lookups and speed things up.

But how to compute the maximum possible sum.

Wait, len(digits) can be up to 4000. So max_possible_sum is 4000 *9=36,000.

So the code can be adjusted to:

s = input().strip()

digits = [int(c) for c in s]

n = len(digits)

prefix_sum = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(n):

    prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + digits[i]

max_sum = 9 * n  # maximum possible sum of any subarray

sum_counts = [0]*(max_sum +1)

for j in range(1, n+1):

    current = prefix_sum[j]

    for i in range(j):

        sum_sub = current - prefix_sum[i]

        if sum_sub <= max_sum:

            sum_counts[sum_sub] +=1

        else:

            # this can't happen because current is prefix_sum[j] which is sum of digits 0..j-1. The maximum sum for a subarray is sum of all digits, which is prefix_sum[n] = sum of digits. But prefix_sum[j] is <= prefix_sum[n], and sum_sub is current - prefix_sum[i]. But since prefix_sum is increasing, current >= prefix_sum[i]. So sum_sub >=0. But the maximum possible sum_sub is sum of all digits (prefix_sum[n] - 0). So sum_sub can be up to sum of all digits. But sum of all digits is up to 9*4000=36,000. So sum_sub is <=36,000. So the 'if sum_sub <= max_sum' is redundant. So we can skip it.

So the code can be:

sum_counts = [0]*(max_sum +1)

for j in range(1, n+1):

    current = prefix_sum[j]

    for i in range(j):

        sum_sub = current - prefix_sum[i]

        sum_counts[sum_sub] +=1

But this requires that all sum_sub values are <= max_sum. Which is true.

So this approach would be more efficient as array access is faster than dictionary lookups.

Then, when a is zero:

count_zero = sum_counts[0]

total_subs = n*(n+1)//2

ans = count_zero * (2 * total_subs - count_zero)

For a non-zero:

ans =0

for k1 in range(1, max_sum +1):

    if sum_counts[k1] ==0:

        continue

    if a %k1 !=0:

        continue

    k2 = a//k1

    if k2 > max_sum:

        continue

    ans += sum_counts[k1] * sum_counts[k2]

This is O(max_sum) time, which is O(36,000) iterations, which is very fast.

This would optimize the code significantly compared to using a dictionary.

So the code should be rewritten using a list instead of a dictionary.

But how to handle sum_sub values that exceed max_sum? Well, since the maximum possible sum_sub is 9*4000=36,000, and max_sum is 9*4000, the sum_sub can't exceed it. So the list is of size 36,001, and sum_sub can be from 0 to 36,000.

So the code becomes:

s = input().strip()

digits = [int(c) for c in s]

n = len(digits)

prefix_sum = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(n):

    prefix_sum[i+1] = prefix_sum[i] + digits[i]

max_sum = 9 * n

sum_counts = [0]*(max_sum +1)

for j in range(1, n+1):

    current = prefix_sum[j]

    for i in range(j):

        sum_sub = current - prefix_sum[i]

        sum_counts[sum_sub] +=1

a = int(input())

if a ==0:

    count_zero = sum_counts[0]

    total_subs = n*(n+1)//2

    ans = count_zero * (2 * total_subs - count_zero)

else:

    ans =0

    for k1 in range(1, max_sum +1):

        if sum_counts[k1] ==0:

            continue

        if a %k1 !=0:

            continue

        k2 = a //k1

        if k2 <0 or k2 > max_sum:

            continue

        ans += sum_counts[k1] * sum_counts[k2]

print(ans)

This should be faster, as it uses lists instead of dictionaries.

But wait, for a=16, which is the second sample input, the code would iterate through k1 from 1 to 36,000, checking if they divide 16. For each k1, if sum_counts[k1] is zero, skip. Else, check if 16 %k1 is zero. Then compute k2=16/k1. If k2 is within the range (0 to 36,000), then multiply the counts.

So for example, k1=1: k2=16. Check sum_counts[1] and sum_counts[16].

But in the sample input, the output is 40, which suggests there are multiple pairs (k1, k2) contributing to the answer.

But using a list-based approach should be more efficient.

Now, considering that the sum_counts list can have up to 36,000 elements, but we only need to iterate through the possible k1 values where sum_counts[k1] >0, but in code, the loop is from 1 to max_sum+1. However, even with 36,000 iterations, each iteration is quick. For example, 36,000 iterations are negligible in Python.

Thus, the list-based approach is better for both time and memory.

So the final code is as described above.

Testing the first sample input:

After computing sum_counts, for the sum 10, sum_counts[10] would be 1. sum_counts[1] is 1. sum_counts[2] is 1. sum_counts[5] is 2. sum_counts[10] is 1.

So for a=10:

ans is sum of:

k1=1: sum_counts[1] * sum_counts[10] =1*1=1.

k1=2: sum_counts[2] * sum_counts[5] =1*2=2.

k1=5: sum_counts[5] * sum_counts[2] =2*1=2.

k1=10: sum_counts[10] * sum_counts[1] =1*1=1.

Also, other possible k1 like 4: 10%4=2, so no. 5: 10/5=2, which is handled.

So total ans is 1+2+2+1=6.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the code should be correct.
