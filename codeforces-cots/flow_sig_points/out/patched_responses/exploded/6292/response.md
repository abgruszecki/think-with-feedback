Okay, I need to solve this problem where Vasya has to dispose of garbage over n days. Each day's garbage can be disposed either on the day or the next. The goal is to use the minimum number of bags, each with capacity k. Let's think about how to approach this.

Hmm. Let's look at the examples. Like the first example: 3 days with a_i 3, 2, 1 and k=2. The output is 3. So how did that happen? On day 1, he produces 3 units. He can put two into a bag (using 1 bag), leaving 1. Then on day 2, that 1 plus day 2's 2 units is 3. So he can use two bags (one with 2 from day 2, and the leftover 1 from day 1 plus 1 from day 2). Wait, maybe not. Let me see the detailed steps.

Wait, another approach: For each day, the garbage from the previous day that's leftover has to be combined with the current day's. The idea is that each day i, we can carry over some garbage from day i-1, but we have to decide how much to leave for day i+1.

Wait, perhaps we can model this as a greedy problem. For each day, we first dispose of the leftover garbage from the previous day. Then, handle the current day's garbage. Or maybe the other way around?

Let's think step by step. Let's process each day in order, keeping track of the leftover garbage from the previous day.

For day i:

The previous day's leftover (call it carry) needs to be disposed on day i. So, on day i, the total garbage to dispose is carry + a_i. But the catch is that some of a_i can be left for the next day (except for the last day).

Wait, but the problem states that all garbage must be disposed by the nth day. So on the last day, any garbage from that day must be disposed on that day. So for each day except the last, we can choose to dispose some of the current garbage and leave some for the next day. But for the last day, all garbage (including carry from day n-1) must be disposed.

So the approach is to process each day, calculating how much garbage to dispose now, considering the carry from the previous day. The key is to decide how much of the current day's garbage to leave for the next day (if possible) to minimize the number of bags.

Let's model this. For day i from 1 to n:

Initially, carry_in is the leftover from day i-1. Then, the total garbage available is a_i + carry_in.

We need to decide how much to dispose now. Let's think: the optimal way is to use as few bags as possible. So perhaps we can combine the carry_in with a_i and dispose as much as possible each day, but also leave as much as possible from the current a_i for the next day, but only if it's possible.

Wait, but carry_in must be disposed on day i. Because carry_in is the leftover from day i-1, which was left to day i. So that must be disposed on day i. So the carry_in has to be disposed on day i. So for day i:

The total garbage is carry_in + a_i. But carry_in must be disposed on day i. So the first step is to dispose the carry_in along with some of a_i.

Wait no. Let's clarify the rules. Each unit of garbage must be disposed either on the day it was produced or the next. So for day i's a_i units: they can be disposed on day i or day i+1. However, for day i+1's garbage, if there's any leftover from day i+1, that must be disposed on day i+1 or day i+2. Except for the last day, which can't leave any.

So, the carry_in for day i is the garbage from day i-1 that was not disposed on day i-1. So that carry_in must be disposed on day i. Because the day i-1's garbage can't be left after day i.

Ah, that's a key point. So any garbage that's carried over from the previous day must be disposed on the current day. So, when processing day i, the carry_in from day i-1 has to be disposed on day i. Then, the current day's a_i can be disposed either on day i or day i+1 (unless it's day n, where it has to be disposed on day n).

So for day i (1-based), here's the approach:

1. Combine the carry_in (leftover from day i-1) with a_i. The carry_in must be disposed on day i.

But wait, the carry_in is the leftover from day i-1, which was part of a_i-1's garbage. So that carry_in must be disposed on day i. So when processing day i, first, we have to dispose the carry_in. Then, we can process a_i's garbage, which can be disposed either on day i or day i+1 (except for the last day).

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Let's say day i-1's a_i-1 is x. Some of x was disposed on day i-1, and the rest (carry_in) is left for day i. So carry_in must be disposed on day i. So for day i, the total that must be disposed is carry_in plus any part of a_i that is being disposed on day i. The rest of a_i (if i is not the last day) can be left to day i+1.

Wait, no. The a_i can be disposed on day i or day i+1. So for day i, when processing, carry_in is from the previous day and must be disposed on day i. Then, the current a_i can be disposed on day i (along with carry_in) or left to day i+1 (if possible).

So during processing day i:

Total garbage that must be disposed on day i: carry_in + s, where s is some of a_i that is disposed on day i. The remaining a_i - s will be left for day i+1 (unless i is the last day).

But how do we decide s?

Our goal is to minimize the total number of bags. So, how can we optimally combine the carry_in and a_i to minimize the number of bags.

Let me think. For day i, carry_in is from the previous day, and must be disposed on day i. Then, we can also dispose some of a_i on day i, or leave it for day i+1.

So the total garbage that must be disposed on day i is (carry_in + s), where s is the part of a_i that is disposed on day i. The remaining a_i - s is carried over to day i+1. However, for day i+1, that's allowed, except if i is the last day (then a_i must be disposed on day i).

So, for each day i (starting from 1 to n):

We have:

current_carry = carry_in (from day i-1)

We need to dispose current_carry + s, where s is part of a_i (0 ≤ s ≤ a_i). The remaining (a_i - s) must be disposed on day i+1, except if i = n, then s must be a_i.

Wait, no. For day i, the garbage produced (a_i) can be disposed on day i or i+1. So s is the part of a_i disposed on day i, and a_i - s is left for day i+1. However, the carry_in (from day i-1) must be disposed on day i. So the total to dispose on day i is (current_carry + s).

But how to model this.

So for day i:

The total that must be disposed on day i is (current_carry + s). However, s is up to a_i.

But the problem is that the s can be any value, but we need to find s such that (current_carry + s) is packed into as few bags as possible, and then the remaining (a_i - s) will be part of the carry for day i+1.

But how to model s to minimize the total bags.

Let me think of the optimal way to choose s.

The carry_in must be disposed on day i. So, when processing day i, we have to combine the carry_in with some part of a_i (s) to form the garbage to dispose on day i, which is (carry_in + s). Then, the remaining (a_i - s) is carried over to day i+1.

But how to choose s such that the sum (carry_in + s) is packed optimally into bags, and (a_i - s) is carried over. But also, the next day's carry plus their a_i+1 will need to be packed, etc.

But this seems like a dynamic programming problem, but for n up to 2e5, that's not feasible.

So we need a greedy approach.

Hmm. Let's think greedily. For each day, we want to dispose as much as possible in the current day, considering the carry_in and the next day's a_i.

Wait, perhaps we can find for each day i, the optimal s is such that the sum (carry_in + s) is packed into the minimal number of bags, and the remaining (a_i - s) is carried over. But how?

Let's consider that when we have carry_in, we can add as much as possible from a_i to fill the bags optimally. For example, if carry_in is 3 and k is 5, then each bag can take up to 5. So if a_i is 4, then perhaps we can take s=2, so that 3+2=5 (one bag), and carry over 2. But maybe that's not optimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to process the carry_in and a_i in a way that combines them in the most efficient way possible, minimizing the number of bags.

Let me try to model this.

For day i, after adding carry_in:

We have to dispose carry_in + s on day i, and leave (a_i - s) to day i+1.

The number of bags for day i is ceil( (carry_in + s) / k )

We want to choose s such that:

- (carry_in + s) is packed into as few bags as possible.

But also, the remaining (a_i - s) will need to be handled in the next day. So perhaps we need to balance between using some of a_i now to reduce the carry_in, and leaving some to combine with the next day's a_i+1.

Wait, but how can we model this optimally?

Alternatively, for each day i, given carry_in, the optimal s is the maximum possible s that can be used to fill the bags in day i along with carry_in, but leaving as much as possible for the next day to combine with a_i+1.

Wait, but maybe the optimal way is to use as much of a_i as possible in day i to fill the carry_in's bags, but without leaving a_i's garbage split in a way that causes more bags in the next day.

Alternatively, think of the carry_in as a value between 0 and k-1. Because if carry_in was more than k, then the previous day's processing would have used a full bag for it. Wait, no. The carry_in is the leftover from the previous day. Wait, the carry_in is the amount that was left from the previous day's a_i-1 after some was disposed on day i-1. But according to the rules, the a_i-1's garbage can be disposed on day i-1 or day i. So, the carry_in is the part of a_i-1 that was not disposed on day i-1, and must be disposed on day i.

But the carry_in can be up to a_i-1. For example, if a_i-1 is 10 and k is 3, and the carry_in is 10 (meaning none was disposed on day i-1), which is possible if the entire a_i-1 is left for day i.

But that's possible only if the next day can process all of that 10 plus their a_i.

So, when processing day i, we have to dispose carry_in (from day i-1) along with some s from a_i (can be 0 to a_i). Then, the remaining (a_i - s) is carried over to day i+1.

But how to choose s to minimize the total bags.

Let's consider the following approach:

At each step i, we have carry_in from day i-1.

The total to dispose on day i is (carry_in + s). The number of bags is ceil( (carry_in + s) / k ). We need to choose s such that s is <= a_i, and the remaining (a_i - s) is carried over to day i+1. But also, for day i+1, we have to process that (a_i - s) along with a_i+1.

But this seems recursive. For example, choosing s in a way that allows the next day to combine the remaining (a_i - s) with a_i+1 optimally.

However, given the problem constraints (n up to 2e5), a dynamic programming approach where we track the carry_in and the minimal bags up to day i is not feasible, because the carry_in can be up to a_i, which can be up to 1e9. So that's not manageable.

So we need a greedy approach. Let's think of how to compute s optimally for each day i.

Here's an idea:

When processing day i, the carry_in must be disposed on day i. So, to minimize the number of bags, we can combine as much as possible of the current a_i with carry_in.

But since the carry_in must be disposed on day i, the optimal way is to first combine the carry_in with some of the current a_i to fill the bags as much as possible, then leave the remaining a_i for the next day.

Wait, here's a possible approach:

For each day i:

1. The carry_in is the leftover from day i-1. We must dispose it on day i.

2. We can choose to use some of a_i (s) to combine with carry_in. The total for disposal is (carry_in + s).

3. The number of bags needed for this is ceil( (carry_in + s) / k ). But we can choose s to minimize this, but also the remaining (a_i - s) must be handled in the next days.

But to minimize the total bags, perhaps it's best to maximize the number of units per bag for day i. So for (carry_in + s), we can arrange s such that (carry_in + s) is as large as possible without leaving a remainder (i.e., (carry_in + s) is a multiple of k). If that's possible, then that would minimize the number of bags. But if not, we can use s as much as possible to fill the bags.

But the problem is that s can't be more than a_i. So let's think:

We can compute the maximum possible s that can be added to carry_in to form a multiple of k. However, s can't exceed a_i.

Wait, perhaps the optimal s is min( (k - (carry_in % k)) % k, a_i ), but that might not be correct. Let's see:

For example, if carry_in is 3, k=5. Then, to make the sum 5, we need s=2. So the sum is 5, which is 1 bag. So that's optimal.

But if a_i is 1, then s can only be 1. So sum is 4, which requires 1 bag (ceil(4/5) is 1). So in this case, that's the best possible.

But maybe this approach of combining carry_in with s such that carry_in + s is a multiple of k, if possible.

But how?

Alternatively, here's the algorithm:

For each day i:

1. We have carry_in from the previous day. This must be disposed on day i.

2. The total available garbage is carry_in + a_i. However, since a_i's garbage can be disposed on day i or day i+1 (if i < n), we need to decide how much to leave for day i+1.

But for day i, the carry_in must be disposed. So:

The minimal number of bags for day i is the number of bags required to dispose carry_in plus the part of a_i that is being disposed on day i. The rest is carried over to day i+1.

But how to model this.

Let me think of the carry_in as C. So for day i, the total we can dispose is C + s, where s is some part of a_i. The remaining a_i - s is carried over to day i+1.

But the problem is that in order to minimize the total bags, we need to maximize the number of units per bag for day i's disposal.

So, for day i, the optimal s would be such that (C + s) is as large as possible (so that the number of bags is minimized). But since s can't exceed a_i, how to compute this.

Wait, perhaps the optimal s is such that (C + s) is as close to a multiple of k as possible. But the remaining (a_i - s) can be carried over to day i+1.

But how?

Alternatively, the idea is to use as much of a_i as possible in day i to "fill up" the current carry_in's required bags, thus reducing the carry-over.

So, for example:

Suppose C = 3, k=5, a_i=7.

We can combine 3+7 = 10, which uses 2 bags. So s=7 (all of a_i), carry-over 0. But that's possible only if i is the last day. Otherwise, if i is not the last day, then leaving 0 carry-over would be allowed.

Wait, but in this case, the carry_in is 3 (must be disposed on day i). So the total to dispose is 3 + s. Then, the remaining a_i - s can be carried over.

Wait, no. Let's see:

In day i (not last), the s can be any value from 0 to a_i. So for day i, we can choose to dispose s (part of a_i) along with carry_in. Then, the remaining (a_i - s) is carried over to day i+1.

But carry_in is 3. So for day i, the total to dispose is 3 + s. So the number of bags is ceil( (3+s) / k ). Then, the remaining (a_i - s) is carried over to day i+1.

So for the next day, the carry_in is (a_i - s).

But for that next day (i+1), the carry_in (a_i - s) must be disposed on day i+1, along with a_i+1. So, in order to minimize the total bags, we want to choose s such that (3 + s) is as close to a multiple of k as possible, and also that (a_i - s) can be combined optimally with a_i+1.

But since a_i+1 is unknown, perhaps the optimal approach is to choose s such that (3 + s) is as large as possible (so that it uses as few bags as possible), while leaving (a_i - s) as much as possible to combine with a_i+1.

Wait, but this is a bit conflicting. For example, if we use all of a_i (s = a_i), then the carry-over is 0. Then, day i+1's carry_in is 0, and they can process a_i+1 as optimally as possible.

Alternatively, if we leave some s, perhaps the carry-over plus a_i+1 can form a larger total that can be packed more efficiently.

Hmm. So perhaps the optimal way is to choose s such that (carry_in + s) is as large as possible, but also, the remaining (a_i - s) can be combined with a_i+1 in the next day to form as few bags as possible.

But how to model this without knowing a_i+1.

This seems tricky. So perhaps a greedy approach is necessary, where we make the best choice possible for the current day, assuming that this will lead to the optimal total.

So here's a possible approach:

For each day i:

- We have carry_in (from day i-1) that must be disposed on day i.

- The total to dispose is carry_in + s, where s is part of a_i (0 ≤ s ≤ a_i).

- The number of bags for day i is ceil( (carry_in + s) / k ).

- The remaining (a_i - s) is carried over to day i+1.

The goal is to choose s to minimize the sum of day i's bags plus the minimal bags for the remaining days.

But since the remaining days' processing depends on the carry-over, this is a recursive problem. However, with n up to 2e5, we need a O(n) approach.

Thus, the only feasible way is to find a way to compute s for each day i in O(1) time, assuming that the choice for s is optimal in a greedy way.

So let's think of the optimal s for day i.

The optimal s would be the maximum possible value that can be added to carry_in to form a multiple of k, but not exceeding a_i. This way, we minimize the number of bags for the current day. The remaining (a_i - s) is carried over.

Wait, let's see. For example, if carry_in is 3, k is 5. Then, to make (3 + s) a multiple of 5, s would need to be 2, 7, 12, etc. But s can't exceed a_i. So s would be min( (k - (carry_in % k)) % k, a_i ). Wait, (k - (carry_in % k)) % k ensures that even if carry_in is a multiple of k, we add 0.

Wait, but if carry_in is 5 and k is 5, then (5 + s) would be a multiple of 5 when s is 0. So in that case, the optimal s is 0. Then, the total (5 + 0) is 5, which is 1 bag. The remaining a_i is carried over.

But what if a_i is 6? Then s would be 0, and carry over 6. Then on day i+1, carry_in is 6, and we process a_i+1 along with it. But 6 can't be split into multiple days, as it's the previous day's leftover. So that would require ceil(6 + s' ), where s' is part of a_i+1.

Hmm. So perhaps this approach leads to a higher number of bags.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to combine carry_in with as much of a_i as possible to fill as many bags as possible, leaving the remaining a_i to be carried over.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

We need to dispose carry_in on day i. So the number of bags required for carry_in is at least ceil(carry_in / k). But since we can combine it with some of a_i, we can form more full bags.

Wait, no. Because carry_in must be disposed on day i, but we can add some of a_i to that to fill the bags more efficiently.

For example, carry_in is 3, k=5. We can take 2 from a_i to make 5, which is one bag. So for that day, the number of bags is 1, instead of ceil(3/5) = 1, but we use the current a_i to fill the bag. However, this uses some of a_i, but may leave less to be carried over.

Alternatively, if carry_in is 3, a_i is 7, k=5. Then, if we take 2 from a_i (s=2), then carry_in + s =5 → 1 bag. The remaining 5 is carried over. Then, next day's carry_in is 5. But for the next day, if a_i+1 is 0, then we have to dispose 5 units, which requires 1 bag. So total is 2 bags. But if we had not taken any a_i (s=0), then carry_in + s =3 → 1 bag, then a_i is 7 carried over. Then next day's carry_in is 7, which requires 2 bags. So total 3 bags. So using s=2 is better.

So combining as much as possible from a_i to fill the bags is better.

So the approach is: for each day i, take as much as possible from a_i (s) to fill the carry_in's capacity, such that carry_in + s is as large as possible (but not exceeding a_i's available s). Then, the remaining a_i - s is carried over.

Wait, but how to compute s.

Let's formalize this:

For day i:

current_carry = carry_in (from previous day)

desired s is the maximum possible such that current_carry + s is as large as possible, but s can't exceed a_i.

But this would be s = a_i. But that's not considering the capacity of the bags. Wait, perhaps we can use s to fill up the bags optimally.

Alternatively, the optimal s is the maximum possible s (up to a_i) that when added to current_carry, the sum is a multiple of k. If possible, then (current_carry + s) is a multiple of k, so number of bags is (current_carry + s)/k. The remaining a_i - s is carried over.

If it's not possible (because a_i is not sufficient to reach a multiple of k), then take the maximum possible s (a_i), which will leave current_carry + a_i. The number of bags is ceil( (current_carry + s) /k ), and the carry-over is 0 (since s = a_i, so a_i - s =0). But that's only if we take all of a_i.

Wait, but that's not correct. For example, if current_carry is 3, a_i is 4, k=5. Then, if s=2, sum is 5 → 1 bag. The carry-over is 4-2=2. Which is better than taking s=4, sum 7 → 2 bags, carry-over 0.

So in this case, using s=2 is better (1+ ... ). But how to find s in this case.

So the optimal way is to find the maximum s where s <= a_i, and current_carry + s is as large as possible without exceeding a multiple of k.

Wait, perhaps the optimal s is the maximum possible s such that (current_carry + s) is as close as possible to a multiple of k. But also, the remaining (a_i - s) can be carried over to the next day.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal s is the maximum possible s that is <= a_i and (current_carry + s) mod k == 0, but if that's not possible, then s is a_i.

So the algorithm would be:

s = min( (k - (current_carry % k)) %k, a_i )

But (k - (current_carry %k )) %k is the amount needed to make current_carry + s a multiple of k. For example, if current_carry mod k is 3, then adding 2 makes it 5, which is a multiple of k.

But this s could be larger than a_i. So we take the minimum between that and a_i. Then, the sum current_carry + s is as close to a multiple of k as possible. Then, the number of bags is (current_carry + s) //k.

But what if s is not enough to make it a multiple? For example, if current_carry is 3, a_i is 1, k=5. Then, (k - (3%5))%k = 2, but a_i is 1. So s is 1. sum is 4, which requires 1 bag. The remaining a_i -s is 0, so carry-over is 0.

But then, the next day's carry_in is 0. So that's okay.

But in this case, we've used s=1, which is better than s=0. Because sum is 3+1=4 → 1 bag, whereas if s=0, sum is 3 → 1 bag. But the remaining a_i is 1. So carry-over is 1. But since this is day i, if it's not the last day, then that 1 must be disposed on day i+1. So day i+1's carry_in is 1, and we process a_i+1.

So what's better in the long run?

It's not clear. But the key is that we need to find a way to process each day optimally given the current state, without looking ahead.

Hmm. So perhaps the optimal s is to take as much as possible to fill the bags for the current day's carry_in plus s, but leave the remaining a_i - s for the next day.

But how?

Let me rephrase. For day i:

We must dispose current_carry.

We can add s from a_i to this disposal. The sum is current_carry + s. The number of bags for this day is ceil( (current_carry + s) /k ).

The remaining a_i - s is carried over to day i+1.

We need to choose s between 0 and a_i.

The goal is to choose s such that the sum of bags for day i plus the minimal bags for the remaining days is minimized.

But since we can't look into the future, we need to choose s in a way that greedily minimizes the sum.

An optimal choice would be to make current_carry + s as large as possible (to fill as many bags as possible), thus reducing the number of bags for the current day, and leaving the minimal possible carry-over for the next day.

Wait, but the carry-over (a_i - s) plus the next day's a_i+1 may be processed more efficiently if the carry-over is a certain value.

But since we don't know the next day's a_i+1, perhaps the best we can do is to leave as much as possible to be carried over, but in a way that allows for combining with the next day's a_i+1.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to minimize the carry-over. Because the carry-over must be disposed on the next day. So if we leave a carry-over of (a_i -s) that is as small as possible, then the next day's processing will have less to carry over.

But this is not necessarily true. For example, if the carry-over is 4 and the next day's a_i+1 is 4, then together they form 8, which is two bags of 5 each (if k=5). But if the carry-over was 0, and the next day's a_i+1 is 8, that would be two bags.

So in that case, it's the same. But if the next day's a_i+1 is 3, then carry-over 4 would require 1 bag (4+3=7 → 2 bags), whereas carry-over 0 would require 3/5=1 bag. So here, leaving carry-over 0 is better.

So it's better to minimize the carry-over. So the idea is to use as much of a_i as possible to fill the current day's bags, thereby leaving as little as possible for the next day.

But how to model this.

So the algorithm would be:

For each day i:

- current_carry is the carry-over from day i-1.

- The sum of current_carry and s (part of a_i) must be disposed on day i. We choose s to be as large as possible (up to a_i) such that current_carry + s can be divided into as many bags as possible. So, the optimal s is a_i, but only if current_carry + a_i can be packed into bags optimally. But perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively, the optimal s is the maximum possible s such that the carry-over (a_i - s) is minimized. So s is a_i. But then current_carry + s = current_carry + a_i. The number of bags is ceil( (current_carry + a_i)/k ). Then, the carry-over is 0 (since s = a_i, a_i -s =0). However, if current_carry + a_i is not a multiple of k, then ceil( (current_carry + a_i)/k ) bags are used.

But this may not be optimal. For example, current_carry is 3, a_i is 4, k=5.

If we take s=4, sum is 7 → 2 bags. Carry-over is 0.

If we take s=2, sum is 5 → 1 bag. Carry-over is 2. Then, in the next day, the carry-over is 2 plus a_i+1. If a_i+1 is 3, then sum is 5 → 1 bag. So total is 1 +1=2. Whereas if we took s=4, sum is 7 → 2 bags, and next day's sum is 3 → 1 bag. Total 3. So in this case, taking s=2 is better.

So the approach of taking s=a_i is not always optimal.

Therefore, we need a better approach.

An alternative idea: For each day i, we can compute s such that:

- The sum (current_carry + s) is as large as possible (so that the number of bags is minimized).

- The remaining carry_over (a_i - s) is such that when added to a_i+1 (if not the last day), it can be packed optimally.

But again, without knowing a_i+1, this is impossible.

Thus, the only feasible approach is to use a greedy strategy that for each day i, chooses s to minimize the number of bags for day i, plus the minimal possible bags for the carry_over (a_i - s) in the next day, assuming that the next day's a_i+1 is zero. Wait, but that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal s is the maximum possible s such that:

(current_carry + s) is as large as possible, and (a_i - s) is as small as possible. But this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the examples:

We can model the carry-over and the current a_i as follows:

For each day i (from 1 to n):

1. The carry_in must be disposed on day i. So, we have to combine it with some s from a_i.

2. The optimal s is the maximum possible s that can be used to make the sum (carry_in + s) a multiple of k, but not exceeding a_i.

3. If this is possible (s >=0 and <= a_i), then we take s = (k - (carry_in % k)) %k. Then, the sum is carry_in + s = x * k. The number of bags is x. The carry_over is a_i - s.

4. If s > a_i, then we take s = a_i. The sum is carry_in + a_i. The number of bags is ceil( (carry_in + a_i)/k ). The carry_over is 0.

But wait, in step 3, if the required s is more than a_i, then we can't take it. So we take as much as possible (s = a_i), but then the sum is carry_in + a_i, which may not be a multiple of k. So the number of bags is ceil( (carry_in + a_i)/k ), and the carry_over is 0.

Wait, but if we take s less than a_i, then the carry_over is (a_i - s). But since the carry_over can be processed in the next day (i+1), perhaps combining it with a_i+1.

So perhaps the optimal approach is to take s as the maximum possible that can be used to make (carry_in + s) a multiple of k, up to a_i.

Let's formalize this:

s = min( (k - (current_carry %k )) %k, a_i )

sum = current_carry + s

bags = sum // k  # since sum is a multiple of k.

carry_over = a_i - s

Then, for the next day, the carry_in is carry_over.

But wait, (k - (current_carry %k )) %k gives the required s to reach the next multiple of k. For example, current_carry=3, k=5: 3 mod 5 is 3, k -3 =2. So s=2. So sum is 5.

If a_i is 3, then s=2 is allowed. So carry_over is 1.

But if a_i is 1, then s can't be 2. So s=1. sum=4. So bags=ceil(4/5) = 1. carry_over is 0.

But according to this approach, when s is less than (k - (current_carry %k )), then sum is current_carry + s, which is not a multiple of k. So the number of bags is ceil( (current_carry + s)/k ). But in this case, s is chosen as a_i, which may not be sufficient to reach the next multiple.

So perhaps the correct approach is:

Compute the required s to make (current_carry + s) a multiple of k. If possible (s <= a_i), then use that s. Otherwise, use s = a_i.

But in code, how do we handle this.

Alternatively, here's the algorithm:

for each day i:

   current_carry = carry_in

   needed = (k - (current_carry %k )) %k

   s = min(needed, a_i)

   sum = current_carry + s

   bags += sum // k

   carry_over = a_i - s

   if i < n:

       carry_in = carry_over

   else:

       bags += (carry_over + k - 1) // k

But wait, what about when it's the last day?

For example, on the last day, any carry_in plus a_i must be disposed on that day. So the carry_over (a_i - s) must also be disposed on day i. So in the last day, we have to take s = a_i.

Wait, no. Because on the last day, the carry_in must be disposed. Then, the a_i's garbage can be disposed on day i, but not the next day (since there is no day i+1). So for the last day, any a_i must be disposed on day i. So the carry_over (a_i -s) must be disposed on day i.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

For day i = n:

carry_in is the leftover from day n-1. So carry_in must be disposed on day n. Also, the a_n's garbage can be disposed on day n. But since there is no day n+1, any part of a_n that is not disposed on day n must be disposed on day n.

So for day n:

The total to dispose is carry_in + a_n. Because any part of a_n not disposed on day n can't be left for the next day (which doesn't exist). So s must be a_n, so the sum is carry_in + a_n. The number of bags is ceil( (carry_in + a_n) /k ). Then, there is no carry_over.

But according to the previous algorithm, when i =n, after processing, we need to add the carry_over (which would be a_i -s) but since i =n, that's the last day, so carry_over must be disposed on day n. So in the code, after the loop, for day n, we must add any carry_over that was left.

Wait, perhaps the previous approach is missing that. Let's see.

For example, in the third example:

3 2

1 0 1

The process is:

Day 1:

carry_in = 0 (from previous)

current_carry =0.

needed = (2 -0%2) %2 → (2-0)%2=0. So s=0. sum=0. bags +=0. carry_over=1-0=1.

But day 1 is not the last day. So carry_in becomes 1.

Day 2:

current_carry=1.

needed = (2 -1%2) = 1. s is min(1,0) → 0.

sum=1+0=1 → ceil(1/2) =1 bag. So bags becomes 0+1=1. carry_over=0-0=0.

carry_in becomes 0.

Day3 (last day):

current_carry=0.

needed = (2-0%2) %2=0. s is min(0,1) →0.

sum=0+0=0 → 0 bags. carry_over=1-0=1.

But since it's the last day, we have to add the carry_over. So after processing, we add ceil(1/2) =1. So total bags=1+0 +1=2.

Which matches the example.

So the algorithm would need to, after processing all days, add the carry_over from the last day (which is zero except for the last day's carry_over).

Wait, no. The last day's carry_over is a_n - s. But during processing, s can be less than a_n. So for the last day, the code must handle the remaining a_n - s.

So perhaps the algorithm should be:

Initialize carry_in =0.

for each day from 1 to n-1:

   process day i, adding to bags.

process day n:

   current_carry = carry_in.

   sum = current_carry + a_n.

   bags += ceil( sum /k )

   carry_over = sum %k.

   if carry_over !=0:

       bags +=1  ??

Wait, no. For day n, all garbage (current_carry and a_n) must be disposed. So sum = current_carry + a_n. The number of bags is ceil( sum /k ). Because all must be disposed on day n.

So the code for day n is different. So the algorithm can be:

Initialize carry_in =0.

for i from 0 to n-2:

   a_i is the current day's garbage (assuming 0-based array).

   process day i+1.

process day n (i =n-1):

   sum = carry_in + a_i.

   bags += (sum +k-1) //k.

So the code would split processing the first n-1 days and the last day separately.

So the steps are:

For days 1 to n-1:

   current_carry = carry_in.

   needed = (k - (current_carry %k )) %k.

   s = min(needed, a_i).

   sum = current_carry + s.

   bags += sum //k.

   remaining = a_i - s.

   carry_in = remaining.

For day n:

   sum = carry_in + a_n.

   bags += (sum +k -1) //k.

So this way, the last day is handled correctly.

Let's test this algorithm against the examples.

First example:

3 2

3 2 1

n=3, days 1,2 are processed, day 3 is last.

Processing day 1 (i=0, a_i=3):

current_carry =0.

needed = (2-0%2) %2 =0.

s=min(0,3) →0.

sum=0+0=0 → bags +=0.

remaining=3-0=3 → carry_in=3.

Processing day 2 (i=1, a_i=2):

current_carry=3.

needed=(2 -3%2) mod2 → (2-1) mod2=1.

s=min(1,2) →1.

sum=3+1=4 →4//2=2 → bags +=2. Total bags=2.

remaining=2-1=1 → carry_in=1.

Day3 (i=2, a_i=1):

sum=1+1=2 → (2+2-1)/2 →2//2=1 → bags +=1. Total=3. Correct.

Yes, matches the first example.

Second example:

5 1

1e9 each.

Processing days 1-4 (0-based 0-3):

day 0: a_i=1e9.

current_carry=0.

needed=(1-0%1)%1=0.

s=min(0,1e9)=0.

sum=0 →0//1=0. remaining=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

day1 (a_i=1e9):

current_carry=1e9.

needed= (1 -1e9%1) mod1 →0.

s=0. sum=1e9 →1e9 bags. remaining=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

Wait, no. Let's see:

current_carry is 1e9. k=1.

needed = (1 - (1e9 %1)) %1. But 1e9 mod 1 is 0. So needed is (1-0) %1=0.

s=0. sum=1e9 +0 =1e9. bags +=1e9.

remaining=1e9 -0=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

But for day 1 (i=0):

Wait, the code is for days 0 to n-2 (0 to 3, since n=5). Then, for day4 (0-based 4, which is the 5th day).

Each iteration for days 0-3:

Day0 (i=0):

sum=0+0=0. bags +=0. remaining=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

Day1 (i=1):

current_carry=1e9.

needed=(1 - (1e9%1)) mod1=0.

s=0. sum=1e9 → bags +=1e9.

remaining=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

Day2 (i=2):

same as day1. bags +=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

Day3 (i=3):

same. bags +=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

Then, day4 (last day) sum=1e9 +1e9=2e9 →2e9 bags. So total is 4*1e9 (from days 1-4) +2e9 (day5) →6e9. But the example's output is 5e9. So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. That indicates that the algorithm is not handling this case correctly.

What's the correct approach for the second example?

The input is 5 days, each a_i is 1e9, k=1.

Each unit must be disposed either on the day or next. So:

All a_i's can be disposed as follows:

Day1: 1e9 → must dispose on day1 or 2.

Day2: 1e9 → day2 or3.

...

Day5: 1e9 → must dispose on day5.

So the minimal bags is sum of all a_i, since each unit requires a bag. But 5e9.

But according to the algorithm's approach, the sum would be:

For days 0-3 (0-based):

Each day's processing adds 1e9 bags. Then, day4's processing adds 2e9 bags. Total 4e9 +2e9=6e9.

But the correct answer is 5e9. So the algorithm is wrong.

So what's wrong with the approach.

Ah, here's the issue. For days 1-4 (0-based 0-3), the algorithm is leaving all a_i to be carried over. Because when current_carry is 1e9, which is k=1. So current_carry%k=0. needed is (1-0) mod1=0. s=0. sum=1e9 +0=1e9. bags +=1e9. Then, remaining a_i is 1e9 -0=1e9. So carry_in for next day is 1e9.

Then, next day's current_carry is 1e9, and same thing.

So for days 0-3 (0-based), each day's a_i is 1e9. The code is adding 1e9 bags for each of these days. But in reality, for these days, the carry_in is 1e9, and the current a_i is 1e9. So the code is adding (1e9 +0)/1 =1e9 bags, and the remaining a_i is 1e9. But for day 4 (0-based 3), after processing, the carry_in is 1e9. Then, the last day (day5) a_i is 1e9. Sum is 1e9 +1e9 =2e9. Bags for that day is 2e9. So total 4e9 +2e9=6e9, but correct answer is 5e9.

So the algorithm is wrong.

What's the optimal way to process this case?

In this case, each day's a_i can be disposed either on the same day or the next. To minimize bags, which is the sum of all a_i since k=1, we need to dispose all of them. But the minimal possible is indeed 5e9.

But according to the algorithm's approach, the code is adding 6e9 bags. So why is that?

Because the algorithm is processing the first four days by adding 1e9 bags each, and the fifth day adds 2e9. But in reality, the correct approach is to dispose each day's a_i on the next day.

Wait, no. Because each unit must be disposed either on its day or the next. So for day1's a_i=1e9, all units can be disposed on day2. For day2's a_i=1e9, all disposed on day3. And so on. Only day5's a_i must be disposed on day5.

So the sum is day1's 1e9 (disposed on day2) + day2's 1e9 (disposed on day3) + day3's 1e9 (day4) + day4's 1e9 (day5) + day5's 1e9 (day5). So total 1e9 *4 (days 2-5) +1e9 (day5) →5e9.

Ah, right. So the algorithm's approach is not capturing this optimal scenario. Because when processing day1 (i=0), the code is adding 0 bags (sum=0), and carry_in becomes 1e9. Then, for day2 (i=1), current_carry=1e9, a_i=1e9. The code would compute s=0, sum=1e9+0=1e9 → 1e9 bags. But this is incorrect because those 1e9 units from day2 are being disposed on day2 along with the carry_in from day1.

Wait, but according to the code's approach, in day i=0 (first day), carry_in is 0. needed is 0. s=0. sum=0. bags +=0. remaining a_i=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

Then, day i=1 (second day), current_carry=1e9. needed is (1 -1e9%1) mod1=0. s=0. sum=1e9 +0=1e9. bags +=1e9. remaining a_i=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

So each day's carry_in is 1e9, and the code is adding 1e9 bags per day for the first four days. Then, the last day's sum is 1e9 (carry_in) +1e9 (a_i) =2e9. Bags +=2e9. So total 4e9 +2e9 =6e9.

But the correct way is to have the first four days' a_i's be disposed on the next day. For example:

Day1's a_i=1e9: disposed on day2 → handled as part of day2's processing.

Day2's a_i=1e9: disposed on day3.

Day3's a_i=1e9: disposed on day4.

Day4's a_i=1e9: disposed on day5.

Day5's a_i=1e9: disposed on day5.

So for day1 (i=0), the code should leave all a_i to day2. But according to the code, during day1's processing:

current_carry=0.

s=0. sum=0. bags +=0. carry_in=1e9.

Then, day2 (i=1), current_carry=1e9.

s=0. sum=1e9. bags +=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

But in reality, the 1e9 from day1 is being disposed on day2, and the 1e9 from day2 is left for day3. So the code is adding 1e9 for day2's disposal, which is the sum of day1's carry_in (1e9) and day2's s=0. But then the code adds 1e9 bags for day2, but in reality, that 1e9 is the disposal of day1's garbage.

So the code is correct in that sense. But then why does the total bags for the example become 6e9 instead of 5e9?

Ah, because each day's a_i is being disposed in the next day. So day1's a_i is disposed in day2, day2's a_i in day3, etc. So day5's a_i is disposed in day5. So the sum is:

Day2: dispose day1's 1e9 →1e9 bags.

Day3: dispose day2's 1e9 →1e9 bags.

Day4: dispose day3's 1e9 →1e9 bags.

Day5: dispose day4's 1e9 + day5's 1e9 →2e9 bags.

Total 1e9 *3 + 2e9 =5e9.

But according to the code's approach, the first four days (days 0-3) are processed as follows:

Day0 (first day):

current_carry=0.

s=0. sum=0 →0 bags. remaining a_i=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

Day1 (second day):

current_carry=1e9. a_i=1e9.

s=0. sum=1e9 →1e9 bags. remaining a_i=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

Day2 (third day):

current_carry=1e9. a_i=1e9.

s=0. sum=1e9 →1e9 bags. remaining a_i=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

Day3 (fourth day):

current_carry=1e9. a_i=1e9.

s=0. sum=1e9 →1e9 bags. remaining a_i=1e9. carry_in=1e9.

Then, day4 (fifth day):

sum=1e9 +1e9 →2e9 bags. Total 1e9 *4 +2e9=6e9.

But the correct answer is 5e9.

So why is there a discrepancy?

Because the code is adding for days 0-3 (four days) 4e9 bags, but according to the correct approach, days 1-4 (four days) would add 3e9 bags. So the code's approach is wrong.

The problem is that the algorithm's approach for days 0 to n-2 (the first four days in this case) is adding 1e9 bags each, which is incorrect. Because in reality, the first four days' a_i's are not being disposed in their own day but carried over, leading to their disposal in the next day.

So the algorithm is incorrectly adding bags for the carry_in, which is from the previous day's a_i-1, but the a_i is being carried over.

Wait, the code's approach for the first four days is:

Each day's processing adds bags for the sum of carry_in and s. But s is 0, so sum is carry_in. Which is the previous day's a_i-1's carry_over. So for day i=0 (first day), carry_in is 0. So sum is 0. Then, carry_over is 1e9.

For day i=1 (second day), current_carry is 1e9 (from first day's carry_over). sum is 1e9 + s (s=0) →1e9. bags +=1e9. This is the disposal of the first day's carry_in (1e9). Then, second day's a_i=1e9 is carried over to third day.

So in this case, the code is adding 1e9 bags for day i=1, which corresponds to the first day's garbage. Then, the third day's processing adds 1e9 bags for the second day's garbage, and so on.

Finally, the fifth day's processing adds 2e9 bags for the fourth and fifth day's garbage.

So total is 4e9 (first four days) +2e9 (fifth day) =6e9.

But the correct answer is 5e9. So the algorithm is wrong.

So why is that? Because the code is adding the carry_in's disposal as part of the current day's processing. But the carry_in is the previous day's a_i's carry_over, which is being disposed on the current day. But the code is adding one bag per day for each carry_in, even though the carry_in is the previous day's garbage.

In the correct approach, the first day's garbage is disposed on the second day (added as part of the second day's bags), the second day's garbage is disposed on the third day, etc., and the fifth day's garbage is disposed on the fifth day.

Thus, the correct number of bags is 1e9 (day2) + 1e9 (day3) + 1e9 (day4) +1e9 (day5) +1e9 (day5) =5e9.

But according to the code's approach, the first day's carry_in is disposed on the second day (1e9 bags), which is correct. The second day's carry_in (1e9) is disposed on the third day (1e9 bags), which is also correct. The third day's carry_in is disposed on the fourth day (1e9 bags), and the fourth day's carry_in (1e9) is disposed on the fifth day, along with the fifth day's a_i (1e9), which is 2e9 bags. So 1e9 *4 + 2e9 =6e9.

But according to the correct approach, the fourth day's garbage (1e9) is disposed on the fifth day, and the fifth day's garbage is also disposed on the fifth day. So that's 2e9 bags. But in reality, those two are added together. So the code's approach is correct for that.

But the problem is that the code's approach is adding 4e9 from the first four days, but the correct answer requires that only 3e9 are added from days 2-4.

So why the discrepancy?

Ah, I think the problem is that the code's approach is processing n-1 days (the first n-1 days) and then the last day. But for n=5, the code's loop runs for i=0 to 3 (n-2 is 3), processing days 1-4. Then, the last day (day5) is processed.

But in the correct scenario, the first four days (1-4) are processed by adding 3e9 bags (days2-5), but the code adds 4e9.

So what's wrong with the algorithm?

The algorithm's approach for the first four days:

For each day i in 0..3 (days 1-4):

carry_in is the previous day's carry_over.

current_carry is carry_in.

s is the minimum between (k - current_carry%k) %k and a_i.

sum is current_carry + s.

bags += sum //k.

remaining is a_i -s.

carry_in becomes remaining.

But for each day in this example, current_carry is 1e9, which is 0 mod 1.

needed is (1 -0) mod 1 =0.

s is 0.

sum is 1e9.

sum//k is 1e9.

bags +=1e9 each day.

So for four days, 4e9 bags.

Then, the last day's sum is 1e9 (carry_in) +1e9 (a_i) =2e9. bags +=2e9.

Total 6e9.

But the correct answer is 5e9.

So the code's approach is not correct.

So the algorithm's approach is flawed.

What's the correct way to model this?

The problem in the code's approach is that when k=1, the optimal way is to leave all possible a_i to the next day, except for the last day.

But the code's approach is not allowing that.

So perhaps the algorithm's approach is not the right way to model the problem.

Alternative approach:

The correct way to model this is to track the carry from the previous day, and for each day i (except the last), decide how much of a_i to combine with the carry to minimize the total bags.

The key is to realize that the carry from day i-1 must be disposed on day i. So, for day i, the carry_in is fixed. We can choose to dispose some s of a_i along with the carry_in. The remaining a_i -s is carried over to day i+1.

The optimal s is such that the sum (carry_in + s) is as large as possible (to minimize the number of bags), but also, the remaining (a_i -s) can be optimally combined with a_i+1.

But since we can't look ahead, the optimal s is the one that allows (carry_in + s) to be as large as possible (to minimize current bags) and leaves (a_i -s) as small as possible (to minimize future bags).

But how to balance these two.

Hmm.

Alternative idea:

The optimal s is the minimum between a_i and (k - carry_in %k) if (carry_in %k !=0), otherwise 0.

Wait, perhaps:

If carry_in %k is not zero, then adding s = k - carry_in%k to carry_in will fill a full bag, reducing the number of bags needed. So s is the maximum possible to fill the current carry_in's partial bag. But if a_i has enough to fill it, then s is set to fill it. Otherwise, take all a_i.

This way, for each day i, we first fill the partial bag from the previous day's carry_in.

So, for example:

carry_in is 3, k=5.

We can add 2 from a_i to make sum 5 → 1 bag. If a_i >=2, take s=2. Else, take all a_i.

This way, the carry_in's partial bag is filled, leading to one bag. Then, the remaining a_i is carried over.

In the second example, this would mean:

Day1:

carry_in=0.

k=1.

carry_in%k=0.

s=0.

sum=0. bags +=0. carry_over=1e9.

Day2:

carry_in=1e9.

carry_in%k=0.

s=0.

sum=1e9. bags +=1e9. carry_over=1e9.

Day3:

carry_in=1e9.

s=0. sum=1e9. bags +=1e9. carry_over=1e9.

Day4:

carry_in=1e9. s=0. sum=1e9. bags +=1e9. carry_over=1e9.

Day5:

sum=1e9+1e9=2e9. bags +=2e9.

Total 1e9 *3 (days2-4) + 2e9 (day5) =5e9. Which matches the example.

Wait, but according to this approach, when carry_in mod k is zero, s is zero, which allows all a_i to be carried over. But in this case, carry_in is 1e9, which mod 1 is 0. So s is zero. Thus, sum is 1e9+0=1e9 → bags +=1e9. carry_over is a_i -s =1e9 -0=1e9. Which is correct.

So what's the correct way to compute s?

The correct approach is:

For each day i (not last):

s = min( a_i, (k - (carry_in %k )) %k )

If (carry_in %k) is non-zero, then s is the amount needed to fill a bag. Otherwise, s is zero.

But wait, when carry_in is a multiple of k, then (k - carry_in%k) mod k is zero. So s is zero. Which allows all of a_i to be carried over.

So for the second example:

carry_in is initially zero.

For day1 (i=0), carry_in is zero. s=0. sum=0. carry_over=1e9.

For day2 (i=1), carry_in=1e9. carry_in mod k=0. s=0. sum=1e9. carry_over=1e9.

Day3 (i=2): same as day2.

Day4 (i=3): same as day2.

Day5 (i=4, last day): sum=1e9 +1e9=2e9 → 2e9 bags.

Total bags: 3e9 (days 2-4) + 2e9 (day5) =5e9.

So why is the code's approach giving 4e9 instead of 3e9?

Because the code's approach for days 0-3 (0-based) adds sum//k. But sum is carry_in + s. For the second example, in day1 (i=0), sum=0+0=0 → bags +=0.

Day i=1 (day2 in 1-based):

current_carry=1e9.

s=0. sum=1e9. sum//k=1e9. bags +=1e9.

Similarly for days i=2 and i=3 (days3 and 4 in 1-based).

So for days0-3 (0-based), four days are processed, each adding 1e9 bags, totaling 4e9.

But the correct approach is to process three days (days 2-4 in 1-based) adding 1e9 each, and day5 adding 2e9. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, because the code's approach is processing days 0 to n-2. In the example, n=5, so days 0-3 are processed (four days), and the fifth day is processed separately.

But in reality, the first four days (1-based days1-4) are processed. But in code's approach, for n=5, days 0-3 (0-based) correspond to 1-based days 1-4. So for each of these four days, the code adds 1e9 bags, totaling 4e9. Then the fifth day adds 2e9. Total 6e9.

But according to the correct approach, the first four days' processing adds three days (days2-4, 1-based) with 1e9 each, and day5 adds 2e9. So why is there a difference?

Because in the code's approach, the first day (1-based) is processed in the loop, which adds 0 bags. But the code's approach is adding 1e9 for the second day (i=1, 0-based) which is day2 in 1-based. So in the code's approach, the four days in the loop (0-based 0-3) correspond to days1-4 (1-based). So for each of these four days, the code adds 1e9 bags.

But according to the correct approach, in the first day (day1), a_i is 1e9. The code's processing of day0 (0-based) leaves carry_in=1e9, and adds 0 bags. Then, for day1 (0-based) (day2 in 1-based), the code adds 1e9 bags. So the code's approach is adding 1e9 bags for day2's processing of day1's carry_in (1e9). Then, day3's processing adds another 1e9 for day2's carry_in (1e9), and so on.

So the code is correct in adding 1e9 bags for each of the four days in the loop (days1-4, 1-based), but the correct approach requires that only three days (days2-4, 1-based) have 1e9 bags. So what's the mistake here?

The mistake is that in the code's approach, the first day (1-based) has a_i=1e9, but the code is not adding any bags for it. The code is adding 0 bags for day0 (0-based) processing, which is correct. But the code's approach for the four days in the loop (days0-3, 0-based) correspond to days1-4 (1-based). For each of these four days, the code adds 1e9 bags. So in the second example, days1-4 (1-based) are processed, and each adds 1e9 bags. Then, day5 adds 2e9. So total is 4e9 + 2e9 =6e9. But the correct answer is 5e9.

So the code's approach is wrong.

Thus, the algorithm is not correct. So what's the correct way to model this?

Alternative approach:

The carry_in must be disposed on day i. The current day's a_i can be disposed on day i or day i+1.

The minimal number of bags is achieved by combining as much of the current a_i as possible with the carry_in to fill full bags, then leaving the remainder for the next day.

So the algorithm should be:

For each day i from 1 to n:

   total = carry_in + a_i

   if i ==n:

       # must dispose all

       bags += (total +k-1) //k

       carry_in =0

   else:

       # decide how much to leave for next day.

       # the maximum we can leave is a_i, but also, (total - s) must be <= a_i.

       # s is the amount disposed on day i.

       # the amount carried over is a_i - s.

       # but wait, total = carry_in + a_i.

       # the amount disposed on day i is carry_in + s.

       # the amount carried over is a_i - s.

       # but since s can be from 0 to a_i.

       # So the amount carried over can be up to a_i.

       # But for day i, the carry_in is carry_in, so the total to dispose is carry_in + s.

       # the remaining is (a_i -s).

       # To minimize the number of bags, we want to maximize (carry_in + s) to be as large as possible, but the remaining (a_i -s) can be carried over.

       # So the optimal s is the maximum possible s that makes (carry_in + s) as large as possible.

       # However, the remaining (a_i - s) must be <= (k-1), because if it's larger than k-1, then the next day would have to use at least one bag for that.

       # Because if the remaining (a_i - s) is r, then in the next day, carry_in is r, and a_i+1 can be added. But if r is larger than k, then the next day's disposal will require at least (r + a_i+1) //k bags.

       # So perhaps the optimal approach is to leave as much as possible, but no more than k-1.

       # So the maximum carry_over is k-1.

       # So, s = max( a_i - (k-1), 0 )

       # But then, the carry_over is a_i - s.

       # Wait, but carry_over can't exceed k-1.

       # So, carry_over = min( a_i - s, k-1 )

       # So s = a_i - carry_over.

       # So the carry_over should be min( a_i, k-1 )

       # Then, the carry_in for the next day is carry_over.

       # But then, the sum (carry_in + s) must be disposed on day i.

       # So s = a_i - carry_over.

       # But how to compute this.

       # Alternatively, the optimal carry_over is the minimum between (a_i) and (k-1). Because if we leave more than k-1, then the next day will have to use more bags.

       # So:

       carry_over = min( a_i, k-1 )

       s = a_i - carry_over

       sum_disposed = carry_in + s

       bags += (sum_disposed +k -1) //k

       carry_in = carry_over

So for each day except the last, we leave up to k-1 units of a_i to be carried over to the next day. The rest is disposed along with carry_in.

This way, the carry_over is at most k-1, which ensures that the next day's carry_in is manageable.

Let's test this approach on the second example.

Example2:

n=5, k=1.

a_i=1e9 each.

For days 1-4 (i=1-4, since last day is 5):

carry_in starts at 0.

Day1 (i=1):

carry_in=0.

carry_over = min(1e9, 0) (since k-1=0). So carry_over=0. s=1e9.

sum_disposed=0 +1e9 =1e9. bags +=1e9. carry_in=0.

Day2 (i=2):

carry_in=0.

carry_over=0. s=1e9.

sum_disposed=0+1e9=1e9. bags +=1e9. carry_in=0.

Day3 (i=3):

Same as day2. bags +=1e9.

Day4 (i=4):

Same. bags +=1e9.

Day5 (i=5, last day):

sum=0 +1e9=1e9. bags +=1e9.

Total 5e9. Correct.

Another test case:

First example:

3 2

3 2 1.

Days1-2:

Day1:

carry_in=0.

carry_over = min(3, 1) →1.

s=3-1=2.

sum_disposed=0+2=2 →2//2=1. bags +=1. carry_in=1.

Day2:

carry_in=1.

carry_over = min(2, 1) →1.

s=2-1=1.

sum_disposed=1+1=2 →1 bag. bags +=1. carry_in=1.

Day3 (last day):

sum=1 +1=2. bags +=1.

Total 3. Correct.

Third example:

3 2

1 0 1.

Day1:

carry_in=0.

carry_over= min(1,1) →1.

s=0.

sum_disposed=0+0=0 →0 bags. carry_in=1.

Day2:

carry_in=1.

a_i=0.

carry_over = min(0,1) →0.

s=0-0=0.

sum_disposed=1+0=1 →1 bag. carry_in=0.

Day3:

sum=0 +1=1 →1 bag. bags +=1.

Total 0+1+1=2. Correct.

Fourth example:

4 4

2 8 4 1.

Processing:

Day1 (i=1):

carry_in=0.

carry_over = min(2, 3) →2. s=0.

sum_disposed=0+0=0 →0 bags. carry_in=2.

Day2 (i=2):

carry_in=2.

a_i=8.

carry_over = min(8,3) →3.

s=8-3=5.

sum_disposed=2+5=7 →7//4=1.75 → 2 bags. bags +=2. carry_in=3.

Day3 (i=3):

carry_in=3.

a_i=4.

carry_over = min(4,3) →3.

s=4-3=1.

sum_disposed=3+1=4 →1 bag. bags +=1. carry_in=3.

Day4 (last day):

sum=3+1=4 →1 bag. bags +=1.

Total: 0+2+1+1=4. Correct.

So this approach seems to handle all examples correctly.

So the algorithm is:

For each day from 1 to n-1:

   carry_over = min( a_i, k-1 )

   s = a_i - carry_over

   sum_disposed = carry_in + s

   bags += (sum_disposed + k-1) //k

   carry_in = carry_over

On the last day:

   sum_disposed = carry_in + a_n

   bags += (sum_disposed +k-1 ) //k

This approach ensures that each day's carry_over is at most k-1, which can be optimally combined with the next day's a_i.

So the code should be written as follows:

Read n and k.

Read a as list.

if k ==0:

   impossible.

bags=0

carry_in=0

for i in range(n-1):

    ai = a[i]

    carry_over = min( ai, k-1 )

    s = ai - carry_over

    sum_disposed = carry_in + s

    bags += (sum_disposed +k-1) //k

    carry_in = carry_over

# handle last day

sum_disposed = carry_in + a[-1]

bags += (sum_disposed +k-1) //k

print(bags)

So this approach handles the cases correctly.

Testing the second example:

n=5, k=1. a_i=1e9 each.

For each day i from 0 to 3 (n-1=4, 0-based):

carry_over = min(1e9, 0) →0.

s=1e9 -0=1e9.

sum_disposed=carry_in +1e9.

carry_in starts at 0.

Day0: sum_disposed=0 +1e9=1e9. bags +=1e9. carry_in=0.

Day1: sum_disposed=0+1e9=1e9. bags +=1e9. carry_in=0.

Day2: same. bags +=1e9.

Day3: same. bags +=1e9.

Last day (day4):

sum_disposed=0+1e9=1e9. bags +=1e9.

Total 5e9. Correct.

Thus, this algorithm seems to work.

So the code in Python should implement this logic.

Edge cases:

Test case where k=1.

Test case where a_i=0.

Test case where a_i=0 except last day.

Another example: input 3 2, 1 0 1. Output 2.

So the code must correctly handle this.

Thus, the code should be written as:

Read n, k.

Read a list.

if n ==0:

   print(0)

else:

   bags=0

   carry_in=0

   for i in range(n-1):

       ai = a[i]

       if k ==0:

           # invalid, but k>=1 per problem constraints.

       carry_over = min(ai, k-1)

       s = ai - carry_over

       sum_disposed = carry_in + s

       bags += (sum_disposed +k -1) //k

       carry_in = carry_over

   # handle last day

   sum_last = carry_in + a[-1]

   bags += (sum_last +k-1) //k

   print(bags)

So this should handle all cases.

Thus, this is the correct approach.

```python
n, k = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
bags = 0
carry_in = 0

for i in range(n - 1):
    ai = a[i]
    carry_over = min(ai, k - 1)
    s = ai - carry_over
    sum_disposed = carry_in + s
    bags += (sum_disposed + k - 1) // k
    carry_in = carry_over

sum_last = carry_in + a[-1]
bags += (sum_last + k - 1) // k
