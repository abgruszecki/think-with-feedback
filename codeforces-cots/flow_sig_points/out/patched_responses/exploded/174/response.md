Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.

The problem is about finding the minimum number of operations needed to calculate the value of a Haar feature using prefix rectangles. Each operation involves taking the sum of a prefix rectangle, multiplying by some integer, and adding it to the variable 'value'. The goal is to express the feature's contribution (each cell's coefficient, which is +1 for W and -1 for B) as a sum of such operations, using as few operations as possible.

So, the main idea is that each cell (i,j) in the feature matrix has a coefficient c_ij (either +1 or -1). We need to represent these coefficients as a sum of multiple prefix rectangles multiplied by their own coefficients, such that the total number of such rectangles is minimized.

Hmm. How to model this? Let's think about the coefficients. For each cell (i,j), the coefficient is determined by the sum of all the prefix rectangles that include (i,j), each multiplied by their own coefficients. So, the problem reduces to finding a way to express the original grid of coefficients as a sum of indicator matrices for prefix rectangles, each scaled by some integer. The minimal number of such rectangles needed is the answer.

Wait, but each operation corresponds to a prefix rectangle. Each prefix rectangle is a rectangle that starts at (1,1) and ends at some (a,b). The indicator matrix for a prefix rectangle (a,b) is a matrix where all cells (i,j) where i <= a and j <= b are 1, and others are 0. Then, the sum of (indicator matrix * k) for various (a,b) and k should equal the original coefficient matrix. The minimal number of terms in this sum is the answer.

So, the problem is equivalent to finding the minimal number of such terms. So, how can we model this?

This reminds me of a problem where we need to find the minimal number of operations to turn a matrix into all zeros by flipping certain regions. The approach there is to process the matrix in a certain order and track necessary operations.

Alternatively, here's an approach inspired by inclusion-exclusion. Let's consider that the coefficient for each cell (i,j) is the sum of all the contributions from the prefix rectangles that include (i,j). Each prefix rectangle (a,b) contributes to all cells (i,j) where i <=a and j <=b. So, the coefficient c_ij is the sum of all the k values (the multipliers) for all prefix rectangles (a,b) where a >=i and b >=j. Because when you add a prefix rectangle (a,b), it affects all cells up to a and b. So, for a cell (i,j), the sum of the k's of all prefix rectangles (a,b) where a >=i and b >=j must equal the original coefficient c_ij.

Wait, that's a key insight. Let me think again. Suppose we have a grid where each prefix rectangle (a, b) contributes a value k. The total contribution to cell (i,j) is the sum of all k's where a >= i and b >= j, because the prefix rectangle (a,b) includes (i,j) only if a >=i and b >=j. Wait, no: the prefix rectangle (a,b) is from (1,1) to (a,b). So any cell (i,j) in that rectangle (i <= a, j <= b) is included. So the contribution of a prefix rectangle (a,b) with coefficient k to cell (i,j) is k if (i <=a) and (j <=b), otherwise zero. So for cell (i,j), the sum over all (a,b) where a >=i and b >=j? No, that's not right. For example, the cell (i,j) is included in all prefix rectangles (a,b) where a >= i and b >= j. So each such (a,b) will include (i,j). So the total contribution to (i,j) is the sum of all k's for prefix rectangles (a,b) where a >=i and b >=j. Because those are the prefix rectangles that cover (i,j). Wait, no. For example, if a prefix rectangle is (2,3), then any cell (i,j) where i <=2 and j <=3 is included. So for cell (i,j), the contribution is the sum of all k's where a >=i and b >=j? No, because (a,b) must be >= (i,j) in both dimensions. Wait, no. For cell (i,j), any prefix rectangle (a,b) where a >=i and b >=j would include (i,j) only if a >=i and b >=j. Because (i,j) is <= a and <= b. So yes, the sum over all (a,b) such that a >=i and b >=j of k_ab (the coefficient of that prefix rectangle) must equal c_ij.

So, the problem now is to find a set of coefficients k_ab (for each possible prefix rectangle (a,b)) such that for each cell (i,j), the sum of k_ab for all a >=i and b >=j is equal to c_ij. Then, the number of non-zero k_ab is the answer.

Our goal is to find the minimal number of non-zero k_ab values.

How can we compute the required k_ab?

This feels similar to a 2D difference array problem, but in reverse. Normally, in a 2D difference array, you process the array from the end, computing the required differences. Let's think in terms of inclusion-exclusion. Since the sum for (i,j) is the sum of k_ab for a >=i, b >=j, then the k_ab can be determined by considering the effect of each cell starting from the bottom-right corner.

Let's process the cells in reverse order, starting from (n, m) and moving to (1,1). For each cell (a, b), the value k_ab is equal to the current coefficient at (a, b), adjusted for the contributions from the previously processed cells (which are larger in both dimensions). Because the k_ab will influence all cells (i,j) where i <=a and j <=b. But since we are processing (a,b) in reverse order, all larger a's and b's have already been processed. Wait, perhaps the correct order is to process the cells in reverse order, starting from (n, m) and moving up to (1, 1). Let's consider that.

For each cell (a, b), the value of k_ab is equal to the desired coefficient at (a,b) minus the sum of all k's that have been already processed (i.e., those with a' > a and b' > b). Wait, not exactly. Let's think:

The sum over a' >=i and b' >=j of k_{a', b'} is equal to the c_ij.

Suppose we process (a, b) in order from largest to smallest. So for each (a, b), we compute k_ab as the required value such that when we add all k's for (a', b') >= (a, b) (i.e., a' >=a and b' >=b), the sum equals c_ab. But how?

Wait, let's think for the cell (a, b). The sum of k's for all (a', b') >= (a, b) must equal c_ab. But (a', b') >= (a, b) here means a' >=a and b' >=b. So for the cell (a, b), the k_ab is the value that accounts for the current c_ab minus the sum of k's from (a', b') that are larger than (a, b) in at least one dimension. Wait, perhaps not. Let's model this.

The contribution to cell (a, b) from all prefix rectangles that are (a', b') where a' >= a and b' >=b is the sum of k_{a', b'}, because each such prefix rectangle includes (a, b). So for cell (a, b), the sum of all k's where a' >=a and b' >=b is equal to the original coefficient c_ab.

So, if we process (a, b) in reverse order (starting from (n, m) down to (1,1)), then when we compute k_ab, all k's that are for (a', b') > (a, b) (i.e., a' >a or b' >b) have already been processed and their contributions to (a, b) are already accounted for.

Wait, no. Wait, when processing (a, b), the cells (a', b') that are processed after (a, b) are the ones with (a', b') less than (a, b). Because we are processing from largest to smallest. So when processing (a, b), all (a', b') that are larger than (a, b) in either a or b have already been processed. So their k's are already determined.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to process (a, b) in the order of decreasing a and decreasing b. For example, process (n, m), then (n, m-1), (n-1, m), (n-1, m-1), etc. So for a given cell (a, b), all cells to the right (higher b) and below (higher a) have already been considered. But how does this affect the sum for (a, b)?

Let me think of the sum for (a, b) as the sum of all k's where a' >= a and b' >= b. So when processing (a, b), the k_ab is the current value of c_ab minus the sum of all k's that are in the region a' > a or b' > b, but that's not exactly right. Wait, when processing (a, b), all k's for (a', b') where a' > a OR b' > b have already been processed. Because we process in reverse order.

Wait, let's model this. Let's process the cells in order starting from (n, m), then (n, m-1), (n-1, m), (n, m-2), (n-1, m-1), (n-2, m), etc., which is equivalent to processing in order of (a + b) descending, and a descending for the same (a + b).

But perhaps a better way is to process the cells in reverse order, starting from (n, m) and moving to (1,1), but in a way that for each cell (a, b), all cells (a+1, b), (a, b+1), (a+1, b+1) have already been processed. Because then, the sum of k's for (a', b') > a and/or b' > b can be computed.

Wait, perhaps the key is that for cell (a, b), the value of k_ab is equal to the desired coefficient minus the sum of k_{a', b'} where a' >= a and b' >=b, and (a', b') is not (a, b). But how to compute that?

Alternatively, the sum for (a, b) is:

sum_{a' >= a, b' >=b} k_{a', b'} = c_ab.

We can rearrange this to:

k_ab = c_ab - sum_{ (a', b') > (a, b) } k_{a', b'}, 

where (a', b') > (a, b) is when a' >= a and b' >=b but (a', b') is not (a, b).

Wait, no. Because the sum includes k_ab and all k_{a', b'} where a' >= a and b' >=b. So:

sum_{a' >=a, b' >=b} k_{a', b'} = c_ab.

But when we process (a, b), the only k's that are not yet computed are those (a', b') where a' <=a and b' <=b. So when processing (a, b), all k_{a', b'} where a' >a or b' >b have already been computed. So the sum of those k's can be calculated, and then k_ab is equal to c_ab minus that sum.

Yes! That makes sense. So for each cell (a, b) in reverse order (from n down to 1, and m down to 1 for each a), we can compute k_ab as:

k_ab = current c_ab (the original coefficient) minus the sum of all k_{a', b'} where a' >= a, b' >=b, and (a', b') is not (a, b). But since we are processing in reverse order, the k_{a', b'} for a' > a or b' >b have already been computed and added to the sum.

So the formula becomes:

k_ab = c_ab - (sum of k_{a+1, b} + k_{a, b+1} - k_{a+1, b+1} )

Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion principle applies here. Because when you take the sum of all k's that are in the region a' >=a and b' >=b, but (a', b') is not (a, b), those are the k's from the cells to the right (b+1 to m), the cells below (a+1 to n), and the cells in both. So the sum can be expressed as:

sum_{a' >=a, b' >=b, (a',b') != (a,b)} k_{a',b'} = sum_{a' >=a, b' >=b} k_{a',b'} - k_ab.

But since in reverse processing, the k_ab hasn't been calculated yet, how does that help?

Alternatively, the sum of all k's for a' >=a, b' >=b is equal to c_ab, which is the desired sum. But when processing (a, b), all the k's that are part of the sum except k_ab have already been computed. So the sum of those (a', b') > (a, b) (i.e., a' >a or b' >b) is equal to:

sum_{a' >a or b' >b} k_{a', b'}

So for (a, b), k_ab is equal to c_ab minus the sum of all k's in that region. Because the sum of all k's in a' >=a and b' >=b is equal to the sum of k_ab and the sum of k's where a' >a or b' >b.

So:

sum_{a' >=a, b' >=b} k_{a', b'} = k_ab + sum_{a' >=a, b' >=b, (a',b') != (a,b)} k_{a',b'}.

But the left side is equal to c_ab. So:

k_ab + sum_{other} = c_ab.

But sum_other is the sum of all k_{a',b'} where a' >=a, b' >=b, and (a',b') is not (a,b). Which is the same as sum of k's where a' >a or b' >b.

Wait, perhaps not. For example, (a+1, b) is a' >a, so included. (a, b+1) is b' >b. Also included. And (a+1, b+1) is in both. So the sum_other includes all those.

But how can we compute sum_other for (a, b)?

Since we process (a, b) in reverse order (from largest to smallest), the sum_other is the sum of:

sum_{a' >=a+1, b' >=b} k_{a',b'} (all cells to the right and down) 

plus sum_{a' >=a, b' >=b+1} k_{a',b'} 

minus sum_{a' >=a+1, b' >=b+1} k_{a',b'} (because they were counted twice).

But this is inclusion-exclusion. So:

sum_other = (sum_{a' >=a+1, b' >=b} k) + (sum_{a' >=a, b' >=b+1} k) - (sum_{a' >=a+1, b' >=b+1} k).

But sum_{a' >=a+1, b' >=b} is the sum for (a+1, b) which is c_{a+1, b} (if that's how the sum is defined). Wait, no. Because sum_{a' >=a+1, b' >=b} k_{a',b'} is equal to the sum that (a+1, b) would have contributed. But according to our model, the sum_{a' >=x, b' >=y} k_{a',b'} is equal to c_{x,y} for each (x,y).

Ah! That's a key point. Because when we compute the sum for (x,y) as per the model, it's exactly c_{x,y}.

So sum_{a' >=x, b' >=y} k_{a',b'} = c_{x,y}.

So, for the current cell (a, b), the sum_other is:

sum_{a' >=a, b' >=b, (a',b') != (a,b)} k_{a',b'} = sum_{a' >=a, b' >=b} k_{a',b'} - k_{a,b} 

But sum_{a' >=a, b' >=b} k_{a',b'} is c_{a,b}, so sum_other = c_{a,b} - k_{a,b}.

But that's not helpful because we need to find k_ab.

Alternatively, sum_other is the sum of k's for (a',b') >= (a, b) and (a',b') != (a,b). Which can be expressed as:

sum_other = (sum_{a' >=a+1, b' >=b} k) + (sum_{a' >=a, b' >=b+1} k) - (sum_{a' >=a+1, b' >=b+1} k).

But each of these terms is equal to c_{a+1, b}, c_{a, b+1}, and c_{a+1, b+1} respectively. Because:

sum_{a' >=a+1, b' >=b} k_{a',b'} = c_{a+1, b} 

sum_{a' >=a, b' >=b+1} k_{a',b'} = c_{a, b+1} 

sum_{a' >=a+1, b' >=b+1} k_{a',b'} = c_{a+1, b+1}

So sum_other = c_{a+1, b} + c_{a, b+1} - c_{a+1, b+1}

Therefore, the formula for k_ab is:

k_ab = c_ab - (sum_other) 

But sum_other is the sum of k's for (a',b') >= (a, b) and (a',b') != (a,b), which is c_ab - k_ab. So substituting back into the equation:

k_ab = c_ab - (sum_other) 

But sum_other = c_ab - k_ab 

Wait, that would imply:

k_ab = c_ab - (c_ab - k_ab) 

Which simplifies to k_ab = k_ab. Which is not helpful.

So, perhaps my earlier approach is the right way. Let's go back.

Since the sum_other is the sum of k's where (a',b') >= (a, b) and (a',b') != (a,b). But how to compute that sum_other in terms of the c's?

Ah, perhaps sum_other is equal to the sum of the contributions from the cells (a+1, b), (a, b+1), minus (a+1, b+1), as those are overlapping.

So sum_other = c_{a+1, b} + c_{a, b+1} - c_{a+1, b+1}

Then, the formula for k_ab is:

k_ab = c_ab - (c_{a+1, b} + c_{a, b+1} - c_{a+1, b+1})

This makes sense, because when you process (a, b) in reverse order, the cells (a+1, b), (a, b+1), and (a+1, b+1) have already been processed. So their c values already account for the sum of their own k's. Thus, the sum_other can be computed using those c values.

So the algorithm would be:

1. Convert the input feature into a coefficient matrix where each cell is +1 for 'W' and -1 for 'B'.

2. Process the cells in reverse order (starting from the bottom-right corner (n, m) to the top-left (1, 1)).

3. For each cell (a, b), compute k_ab as c_ab - (c_{a+1, b} + c_{a, b+1} - c_{a+1, b+1}).

4. If k_ab is not zero, increment the count (since each non-zero k_ab corresponds to an operation).

But how to handle the boundaries? For example, if a is the last row (n), then a+1 would be out of bounds. Similarly for the columns.

In such cases, the cells outside the matrix (a >n or b> m) are considered to have c value 0, since their contribution is zero. So for (a, b), when a is n, c_{a+1, b} is 0. Similarly, when b is m, c_{a, b+1} is 0.

So during the processing, for each cell (a, b):

sum_other = c_{a+1, b} (if a+1 <=n else 0) + c_{a, b+1} (if b+1 <=m else 0) - c_{a+1, b+1} (if a+1 <=n and b+1 <=m else 0)

Then, k_ab = c_ab - sum_other.

Once k_ab is computed, if it's non-zero, we count it as an operation. Then, we update c_ab to be k_ab (but wait, no: the c_ab is part of the original coefficient matrix. Wait, no. Wait, the c_ab here is the original coefficient matrix. But when processing (a, b), the c_ab is the original value. However, after processing (a, b), we need to store the value of k_ab, which is the coefficient for the prefix rectangle (a, b). But in the algorithm above, how is the c_ab being used? Because the sum_other is calculated using the original c values of (a+1, b), etc. But after processing (a+1, b), the k_ab for (a+1, b) has been computed, but the c_{a+1, b} is the sum of all k's for (a' >=a+1, b' >=b). So, perhaps during processing, we need to create a separate matrix to track the current sum for each cell (a, b). Wait, but according to the formula, the sum for (a, b) is the original coefficient matrix. But that can't be right. Wait, perhaps the original c matrix is being modified as we process each cell.

Wait, let's think again. The sum for (a, b) is the sum of all k's for (a' >=a and b' >=b). But the original c_ab is the desired sum. So when we process (a, b), the sum_other is computed using the original c's of the cells (a+1, b), (a, b+1), and (a+1, b+1). Then, k_ab is set to c_ab - sum_other. But after computing k_ab, the sum_other plus k_ab would equal the original c_ab. But according to the model, the sum for (a, b) is k_ab plus sum_other, which should equal the original c_ab. So this is correct.

But how does this affect the processing of cells (a-1, b), etc.? Because when processing (a, b), the sum for (a, b) is computed as the original c_ab. But when we process (a-1, b), the sum_other for (a-1, b) would involve c_{a, b} (the original value) plus other terms. But according to the model, the sum for (a-1, b) is the sum of k's >= (a-1, b). But in the model, after processing (a, b), the sum for (a, b) is the original c_ab. So the formula holds.

Wait, perhaps the original c matrix is being overwritten as we process each cell. Let's see.

When processing (a, b), we compute k_ab as c_ab - (c_{a+1, b} + c_{a, b+1} - c_{a+1, b+1}).

But then, after that, the sum for (a, b) is k_ab + sum_other. Which is equal to (c_ab - sum_other) + sum_other = c_ab. So the sum for (a, b) remains c_ab, which is what is needed.

But when processing (a-1, b), for example, the sum_other for (a-1, b) is c_{a, b} (the original value) + ... etc. But according to the model, the sum_other for (a-1, b) is the sum of k's in the region (a', b') >= (a-1, b) except (a-1, b), which would include (a, b) and others. But (a, b) was processed earlier, and the k_ab is part of that sum. So the original c_{a, b} is equal to the sum of k's for (a', b') >= (a, b), which includes k_ab. So when processing (a-1, b), the sum_other for (a-1, b) is sum of k's >= (a-1, b) except k_{a-1, b}.

But how is that sum computed? According to the formula, it's c_{a, b} (the sum for a', b' >= a, b) plus c_{a-1, b+1} (sum for a' >= a-1, b' >=b+1) minus c_{a, b+1} (sum for a' >=a, b' >=b+1). 

Wait, maybe the approach is correct. Because when we process (a, b), we compute k_ab, which is the coefficient for the prefix rectangle (a, b). Then, the sum for (a, b) (which is the sum of all k's >= (a, b)) is exactly the original c_ab. So when processing (a-1, b), the sum_other for (a-1, b) will include the sum of k's >= (a, b), which is c_ab. So the formula holds.

Thus, the algorithm is as follows:

- Create a matrix of coefficients c where c[i][j] is 1 for 'W' and -1 for 'B'.

- Iterate through the matrix in reverse order (starting from the last row and column, moving to the first).

- For each cell (i, j), compute the required k_ab as c[i][j] minus the sum_other, where sum_other is c[i+1][j] (if i+1 exists) + c[i][j+1] (if j+1 exists) - c[i+1][j+1] (if both i+1 and j+1 exist).

- If k_ab is non-zero, increment the count.

- The total count is the answer.

So, for example, in the first sample input:

The feature is a 6x8 grid where the first three rows are 'B' and the next three are 'W'. So the coefficient matrix for rows 4-6 (assuming 1-based index) is 1, others are -1.

Processing starts at (6,8). The sum_other for this cell is c[7][8] (0, since 7>6) + c[6][9] (0) - c[7][9] (0) = 0. So k_ab = 1 -0 =1. This is non-zero, count becomes 1.

Then, processing (6,7), etc., but in the end, the only non-zero k_ab's are (6,8) with k=1 and (3,8) with k=-2. So the count is 2, which matches the first sample.

This approach will compute the minimal number of operations, as each non-zero k_ab corresponds to a prefix rectangle (a, b) multiplied by k_ab, and the sum of all these gives the desired coefficients. The order of processing ensures that each required k_ab is computed correctly.

So the steps for the code are:

1. Read n and m.

2. Read the feature matrix, converting each cell to 1 or -1.

3. Initialize a 2D array (could be a list of lists) for the coefficients.

4. Process the cells in reverse order (from n down to 1, and for each row, from m down to 1).

5. For each cell (i, j), compute the sum_other as the sum of the cells (i+1,j), (i,j+1), minus (i+1,j+1), handling boundaries where i+1 or j+1 are out of bounds (use 0 in those cases).

6. Compute k_ab = c[i][j] - sum_other.

7. If k_ab is non-zero, increment the count.

8. Update c[i][j] to be k_ab, so that when processing cells above or to the left, the sum_other will use this value. Wait, wait! Wait, no. Because the sum_other for (i-1, j) would require the sum of k's for (i, j), which is equal to c[i][j] (since sum of k's >= i,j is c[i][j]). But according to the algorithm, when processing (i, j), after calculating k_ab, the sum of k's >= (i, j) is c_ab, which is the original value. Wait, but after processing (i, j), the c[i][j] is updated to k_ab, but according to the model, the sum of k's >= (i,j) is equal to c_ab (the original value). So perhaps we need to track the sum of k's >= (i,j) as we process each cell.

Wait, maybe the original code is wrong. Because when processing (i,j), after computing k_ab, the sum of k's >= (i,j) is equal to the original c_ab. But the sum of k's >= (i,j) is k_ab plus the sum_other (sum of k's in a' >=i, b' >=j except (i,j)). So when we compute k_ab, we have to set the c_ab to k_ab plus sum_other. But sum_other is c_{i+1,j} + c_{i,j+1} - c_{i+1,j+1}. So, after processing (i,j), the new c_ab would be:

c_ab = k_ab + sum_other 

But sum_other is (c_{i+1,j} + c_{i,j+1} - c_{i+1,j+1}).

But according to the formula:

k_ab = original_c_ab - sum_other 

So, original_c_ab = k_ab + sum_other 

But after processing (i,j), the sum of k's >= (i,j) is k_ab + sum_other = original_c_ab. So, to track this, we need to update the c_ab after processing (i,j) to be original_c_ab, which is k_ab + sum_other. Wait, but that's the same as original_c_ab. So perhaps the original code is correct, and the c matrix remains unchanged except when processing (i,j), the k_ab is computed and stored, but the c matrix is not modified.

Wait, but in the algorithm outlined above, the code uses the original c matrix. So during processing (i,j), the sum_other is computed using the original c values of the cells (i+1,j), (i,j+1), (i+1,j+1). But when processing (i,j), the k_ab is computed, but not stored in the c matrix. Then, the count is incremented if k_ab is non-zero.

But this would not account for the fact that when processing (i-1,j), the sum_other for (i-1,j) would need to include the k_ab from (i,j), which is part of the sum_other for (i-1,j). So how is this handled?

Ah, here's the mistake. The algorithm must process the cells in such a way that when (i,j) is processed, the sum_other for (i,j) is computed based on the current values of the c matrix for (i+1,j), (i,j+1), etc. But after processing (i,j), the c[i][j] should be updated to be the sum of k_ab plus sum_other (which equals the original c_ab). Wait, but that's not correct. Because the sum of k's for (a' >=i, b' >=j) is equal to original c_ab. So, for (i-1, j), when computing sum_other, it will take c[i][j], which is original c_ab, not the sum of k's >=i,j. So this would be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the c matrix should be modified as we process each cell. Because when processing (i,j), after computing k_ab, the sum of k's >=i,j is original_c_ab. But this sum is equal to k_ab plus the sum of k's >=i+1,j and >=i,j+1 and ... etc. So the original code uses the original c values, which are not updated. That would be wrong.

So, to correctly compute the sum_other for (i,j), we need to have the current sum of k's >=i+1,j, which is stored in c[i+1][j]. But c[i+1][j] is the sum of k's >=i+1,j, which was computed when processing (i+1,j). So, during processing (i,j), the c matrix is modified. So the steps are:

Initially, the c matrix is the original coefficients. But as we process each cell (i,j), we compute the k_ab, and then update c[i][j] to be the sum of k_ab and the sum_other. But according to our model, sum_other is the sum of k's >=i+1,j and >=i,j+1, etc. So after processing (i,j), the sum of k's >=i,j is original_c_ab.

But how does this work? Let's think:

When processing (i,j):

sum_other = c[i+1][j] (sum of k's >=i+1,j) + c[i][j+1] (sum of k's >=i,j+1) - c[i+1][j+1] (sum of k's >=i+1,j+1)

k_ab = original_c_ab - sum_other

Then, the sum of k's >=i,j is k_ab + sum_other = original_c_ab.

But after processing (i,j), the c[i][j] should now hold the sum of k's >=i,j, which is original_c_ab. So, the code should not modify the c matrix. Because the sum for (i,j) is always the original_c_ab, and the sum_other for (i,j) is computed based on the sum of the cells below and to the right.

But then, when processing (i-1,j), the sum_other for (i-1,j) would include c[i][j], which is the original_c_ab. But according to the model, the sum_other for (i-1,j) is the sum of k's >=i,j (original_c_ab) plus the sum of k's >=i-1, j+1, etc. But that's not correct. Because the sum_other for (i-1,j) is the sum of all k's that are >=i-1,j and >=i-1,j except (i-1,j) itself. But the k's in this region include those from (i,j), (i-1,j+1), etc. But according to the model, the sum_other for (i-1,j) should be computed using the sum of the k's that are in the region a >=i-1, b >=j, but not including (i-1,j). 

So the problem arises because the sum_other for (i-1,j) is computed as:

sum_other = c[i][j] (sum of k's >=i,j) + c[i-1][j+1] (sum of k's >=i-1,j+1) - c[i][j+1] (sum of k's >=i,j+1)

But this would give the correct sum_other for (i-1,j) because:

sum_other is sum of k's >=i-1,j and >=i-1,j but not (i-1,j). Which is the sum of k's in the regions (i,j) and (i-1,j+1), but subtract the overlap (i,j+1). 

But according to the model, the sum_other for (i-1,j) is computed as the sum of c[i][j], c[i-1][j+1], minus c[i][j+1]. But this is correct because:

sum_other = sum_{a' >=i, b' >=j} k_{a',b'} + sum_{a' >=i-1, b' >=j+1} k_{a',b'} - sum_{a' >=i, b' >=j+1} k_{a',b'}

Which is the sum of all k's where (a' >=i and b' >=j) or (a' >=i-1 and b' >=j+1), minus the overlapping region (a' >=i and b' >=j+1). But this represents the k's that are either in the region a' >=i, b' >=j (which is part of a' >=i-1, b' >=j) or a' >=i-1, b' >=j+1. However, this logic is a bit tricky.

But perhaps the algorithm is correct as long as we process the cells in reverse order and compute the sum_other as described. Let's take the first sample input:

Sample 1:

6 8

BBBBBBBB (3 rows of B's)

BBBBBBBB

BBBBBBBB

WWWWWWWW (3 rows of W's)

WWWWWWWW

WWWWWWWW

The original coefficient matrix is:

For rows 1-3 (0-based?), or 1-based rows 1-3, each cell is -1.

Rows 4-6 (1-based) are 1.

When processing (6,8):

sum_other is c[7][8] (0) + c[6][9] (0) - 0 =0. So k_ab =1 -0=1.

count is now 1.

Processing (6,7):

sum_other is c[7][7] (0) + c[6][8] (which is 1) - 0 (c[7][8] is 0) → sum_other=1.

k_ab =1 (original c[6][7]) -1=0. So no count.

Similarly, processing other cells in row 6, columns 8 to 1. Only (6,8) gives a non-zero k_ab.

Then processing row 5, columns 8 down to 1. Again, for (5,8):

sum_other is c[6][8] (1) + c[5][9] (0) - c[6][9] (0) → sum_other=1.

k_ab =1 (original c[5][8]) -1=0. So no count.

Processing (3,8):

sum_other is c[4][8] (original c[4][8] is 1) + c[3][9] (0) - c[4][9] (0) → sum_other=1.

k_ab = -1 (original c[3][8] is -1) -1= -2.

So this is non-zero, count becomes 2.

Then, the other cells in row 3, column 8 and lower. For example, (3,7):

sum_other is c[4][7] (original 1) + c[3][8] (original -1) - c[4][8] (original 1) → 1 + (-1) -1= -1.

k_ab is original c[3][7] (-1) - (-1) = 0. So no count.

So for this sample, the count is 2, which is correct.

So the algorithm works.

Thus, the code must process the cells in reverse order (from n to 1, and for each row, m to 1). For each cell (i,j), compute sum_other as the sum of c[i+1][j], c[i][j+1], minus c[i+1][j+1], handling out-of-bounds as 0. Then compute k_ab as original_c[i][j] - sum_other. If k_ab is non-zero, increment the count. Then, we do not need to modify the original c matrix, because the sum_other for other cells is computed based on the original c values.

Wait, but this is a problem. Because when processing (i,j), the sum_other for (i-1,j) would require the sum of k's >=i,j, which is original_c[i][j]. But according to the model, the sum of k's >=i,j is equal to original_c[i][j], which is the sum of all k_ab's that are >=i,j. But k_ab is computed as original_c[i][j] - sum_other. So when we compute sum_other for (i-1,j), it uses the original_c[i][j], which is correct.

But why is that correct? Because the sum of k's >=i,j is original_c[i][j], which is the desired sum. The sum_other for (i-1,j) is sum of k's >=i,j (original_c[i][j]) + sum of k's >=i-1,j+1 (original_c[i-1][j+1}) - sum of k's >=i,j+1 (original_c[i][j+1}).

But according to the model, this sum_other for (i-1,j) is the sum of all k's that are >=i-1,j, but not (i-1,j) itself. Which is exactly the sum computed.

Thus, the code can proceed without modifying the original c matrix, because the sum_other for other cells is based on the original coefficients, not the computed k_ab's.

Wait, this seems incorrect. Because when we process (i,j), we compute k_ab as the coefficient for the prefix rectangle (i,j). The sum of k_ab's >= (i,j) should be original_c[i][j]. But the sum_other for (i,j) is computed as sum of k_ab's >=i+1,j and others. But how does this sum_other account for the other k_ab's computed after (i,j)?

For example, when processing (i,j), the sum_other is based on c[i+1][j], which is the original c value. But when (i+1,j) is processed later (since we are processing in reverse order), no. Wait, no. Because we process cells in reverse order. For example, if i is 6, then i+1 is 7, which is out of bounds. So for (6,8), sum_other is computed using c[7][8] (0), c[6][9] (0), and c[7][9] (0). So sum_other is 0. Then k_ab = 1-0=1. So the sum of k_ab's >=6,8 is 1. Which is correct.

But when processing (5,8), sum_other is computed as c[6][8] (original c[6][8] is 1) + c[5][9} (0) - c[6][9} (0) → sum_other =1. So k_ab = original c[5][8} (1) - 1 =0. So the sum of k_ab's >=5,8 is 0 +1 (from (6,8)) =1. Which matches the original c[5][8} of 1.

So the algorithm works correctly.

Ah! Because when processing cells in reverse order, the cells (i+1,j) and others are processed later. Wait, no. Because we are processing from the bottom-right upwards, the cells (i+1,j) would have been processed before (i,j) if i+1 <=n. But no. For example, in a 6x8 grid, processing starts at (6,8), then (6,7), (6,6), ..., (6,1), then (5,8), (5,7), etc. So for cell (5,8), the cell (6,8) has already been processed, and the sum_other for (5,8) uses the original c[6][8}, which is 1 (the original c_ab for that cell).

But the sum of k_ab's >=5,8 is the sum of k_ab's for (5,8) and any cells >=5,8. But according to the model, the sum is supposed to be the original c_ab for (5,8) (which is 1). When processing (5,8), k_ab is computed as 1 - sum_other (1) =0. So the sum of k_ab's >=5,8 is 0 + sum_other (1) =1, which is correct.

But where does the sum_other (1) come from? sum_other for (5,8) is c[6,8} (original 1) + c[5,9} (0) - c[6,9} (0) → 1. So sum_other is 1. And sum_other is the sum of k_ab's >=6,8 (which is 1, from cell (6,8)), and >=5,9 (0), and subtract the sum of k_ab's >=6,9 (0). So sum_other is 1.

So the sum_other is correctly computed.

Thus, the algorithm works because during processing, the sum_other for (i,j) is computed using the original c values of the cells (i+1,j), (i,j+1}, etc., which have already been processed. Because processing is done in reverse order.

Wait, no. For example, when processing (i,j), the cells (i+1,j) and (i,j+1) would have been processed later (since we process from high i and j to low). So when processing (i,j), the cells (i+1,j) and (i,j+1) have not been processed yet. So their c values are still the original ones. But according to the algorithm, the sum_other for (i,j) is computed using their original c values, which are not the sum of their k_ab's. So this seems to be a mistake.

Wait, this is a critical point. For example, processing cell (6,8) first. Then (6,7), (6,6), ..., then (5,8), (5,7), etc. When processing (5,8), the sum_other is c[6][8} (original 1) + c[5][9} (0) - c[6][9} (0) =1. But (6,8) has been processed, and the c[6][8} is still 1. But according to the model, the sum of k_ab's >=6,8 is 1. Which is correct, because the k_ab for (6,8) is 1.

So the sum_other for (5,8) is 1, which is correct. But why is c[6][8} still 1? Because the c matrix hasn't been modified. So in this case, the algorithm computes sum_other correctly because the sum_other is using the original c values, but the actual sum of k_ab's >=6,8 is 1, which equals the original c[6][8} (1). So the sum_other is correctly computed.

Thus, the algorithm works correctly even without modifying the c matrix. Because the sum_other for (i,j) is computed based on the original c values, which are equal to the sum of k_ab's >=i',j' for all cells (i',j'). 

But why is that true? Because the sum of k_ab's >=i',j' is equal to the original c[i'][j'].

Ah! Because when we compute k_ab for (i,j), it's computed as original_c[i][j] - sum_other. But sum_other is based on the original_c[i+1][j], original_c[i][j+1}, and original_c[i+1][j+1}. 

But according to the model, the sum of k_ab's >=i,j is equal to original_c[i][j], which is correct. So the sum_other is the sum of k_ab's that are >=i+1,j, >=i,j+1, etc. But how can sum_other be computed based on the original_c values of those cells?

Because each of those cells (i+1,j), etc., when processed, will have their own sum_other computed based on their own original_c values. So the sum of k_ab's >=i+1,j is equal to original_c[i+1][j}, and similarly for other cells.

Thus, the algorithm works because the sum_other for (i,j) is:

sum_other = original_c[i+1][j} + original_c[i][j+1} - original_c[i+1][j+1}.

Which is the sum of k_ab's >=i+1,j (original_c[i+1][j}) plus those >=i,j+1 (original_c[i][j+1}) minus those >=i+1,j+1 (original_c[i+1][j+1}).

This works because the sum of k_ab's in these regions is exactly the sum_other needed.

Thus, the code can proceed by using the original c matrix and processing in reverse order.

So, to implement this:

We'll create a 2D array of the original coefficients. Then, for each cell (i,j) in reverse order, compute sum_other as follows:

sum_other = 0

if i+1 <=n: sum_other += c[i+1][j]

if j+1 <=m: sum_other += c[i][j+1}

if i+1 <=n and j+1 <=m: sum_other -= c[i+1][j+1]

k = c[i][j] - sum_other

if k !=0: increment count.

So the code in Python would look like:

n, m = map(int, input().split())

# Read the feature matrix, converting to 1 and -1
c = []
for _ in range(n):
    row = input().strip()
    c_row = [1 if ch == 'W' else -1 for ch in row]
    c.append(c_row)

count = 0

for i in reversed(range(n)):
    for j in reversed(range(m)):
        sum_other = 0
        # Check i+1
        if i +1 < n:
            sum_other += c[i+1][j]
        else:
            sum_other += 0
        # Check j+1
        if j +1 < m:
            sum_other += c[i][j+1]
        else:
            sum_other += 0
        # Check i+1 and j+1
        if i+1 < n and j+1 < m:
            sum_other -= c[i+1][j+1]
        # Compute k
        k = c[i][j] - sum_other
        if k !=0:
            count +=1

print(count)

Wait, but in the code above, the indices are 0-based. So for example, in the first sample, rows are 0-5 (assuming 0-based), and columns 0-7.

When processing i=5 (the last row, 6th row in 1-based), j=7 (last column), sum_other is computed using i+1=6 (which is >=n (6 rows in 0-based? Wait n=6, indices 0-5. So i+1 would be 5+1=6, which is >=n (6) → no. So sum_other for (5,7) is 0.

But in the first sample, the code computes k_ab as c[5][7] (1) - sum_other (0) → 1. Count is incremented.

Then, when processing i=2 (third row in 0-based, which is row 3 in 1-based), j=7:

sum_other = c[3][7] (1) + c[2][8] (which is out of bounds, j+1=8 >=m=8 (since m=8 columns, 0-based is 0-7). So sum_other +=0. Then, subtract c[3][8] (out of bounds) → sum_other=1.

k = -1 (original c[2][7]) -1 = -2. Count increases by 1.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the code seems correct.

But why are we using 0-based indices here? Because in Python, lists are 0-based.

Testing the code against the first sample:

Sample 1 input:

6 8

BBBBBBBB (rows 0,1,2)

BBBBBBBB

BBBBBBBB

WWWWWWWW (rows 3,4,5)

WWWWWWWW

WWWWWWWW

The c matrix for rows 0-2 (0-based) have all -1, rows 3-5 have all 1.

Processing i from 5 downto 0, j from 7 downto 0.

For i=5, j=7: sum_other is 0. k=1-0=1 → count becomes 1.

For i=5, j=6: sum_other is c[5][7] (1) + 0 (j+1=7+1=8 >=8 → no) → sum_other=1. k=1-1=0 → no count.

For i=5, j=5: sum_other is c[5][6] (0) + 0 (j+1=6→ j=5+1=6 <8? yes. c[5][6] is 1. Wait, no. Wait for j=5, j+1=6. c[i][j+1] is c[5][6], which is 1 (since row 5 is all 'W's). So sum_other=1 (from c[5][6] and c[5+1][5] is i+1=6 which is >=6 → no. So sum_other=1. k=1 -1=0 → no count.

And so on. All cells in row 5 except j=7 will have sum_other= c[i+1][j] (out of bounds) + c[i][j+1] (1 for j <7) → sum_other=1. So k=1-1=0. So no count.

Then, row 4: all cells have sum_other as c[5][j] (1) + c[4][j+1} (1) - c[5][j+1} (1). sum_other=1+1-1=1. k=1-1=0 → no count.

Row 3: similarly, sum_other= c[4][j} (0) + c[3][j+1} (0) - c[4][j+1} (0). sum_other=0. So k=1-0=1. But j ranges from 7 downto 0. So for j=7: sum_other =0. k=1 → count increases by 1. But wait, the count was already 1 from cell (5,7). So the code would count this as well. But according to the sample, the correct answer is 2. So there's a mistake.

Wait, no. The code counts the k_ab for cell (3,7) (row 3, column 7 in 0-based, which is row 4, column 8 in 1-based) as 1- sum_other=0. But according to the sample's note, the second operation is on the prefix rectangle (3,8) (1-based), which is (2,7) in 0-based. So perhaps there's a mistake in the code.

Wait, in the first sample, the correct answer is 2. The two operations are:

1. prefix rectangle (6,8) with coefficient 1.

2. prefix rectangle (3,8) with coefficient -2.

But in the code, when processing i=2 (row 3 in 1-based), j=7 (column 8 in 1-based):

sum_other = c[3][7] (which is row 4, column 8 → which is part of the W rows. So c[3][7] is 1) + c[2][8} (out of bounds, 0) → sum_other=1. So k_ab is original c[2][7} (which is -1) -1 =-2 → count increases by 1. So total count is 2.

Ah yes! Because the code for i=2 (third row in 0-based) and j=7 (eighth column in 0-based) would compute sum_other as:

i+1 is 3, which is <6 (since n=6 rows, 0-based up to 5). So c[i+1][j] is c[3][7} → which is 1.

j+1 is 8 → out of bounds. So sum_other +=0.

Then check if i+1 and j+1 are in bounds: 3 <6, 8 >=8 → no. So subtract 0.

sum_other =1.

k = c[2][7} -1 → -1-1 =-2 → count +=1. So total count becomes 2.

Yes, this is correct.

Thus, the code should work.

Testing the second sample:

Sample 2 input:

3 3

WBW

BWW

WWW

The code would process each cell.

The original c matrix is:

Row 0: W B W → [1, -1, 1]

Row 1: B W W → [-1, 1, 1]

Row 2: W W W → [1, 1, 1]

Processing cells in reverse order (i=2 downto 0, j=2 downto 0):

i=2, j=2:

sum_other is c[3][2} (0) + c[2][3} (0) → 0. k=1-0=1 → count=1.

i=2, j=1:

sum_other is c[3][1} (0) + c[2][2} (1) → 1. k=1 -1=0 → no count.

i=2, j=0:

sum_other is c[3][0} (0) + c[2][1} (1) →1. k=1-1=0 → no.

i=1, j=2:

sum_other is c[2][2} (1) + c[1][3} (0) →1. k=1-1=0 → no.

i=1, j=1:

sum_other is c[2][1} (1) + c[1][2} (1) - c[2][2} (1) → 1+1-1=1. k=1-1=0 → no.

i=1, j=0:

sum_other is c[2][0} (1) + c[1][1} (1) - c[2][1} (1) → 1+1-1=1. k=-1 -1 =-2 → count=2.

i=0, j=2:

sum_other is c[1][2} (1) + c[0][3} (0) →1. k=1-1=0 → no.

i=0, j=1:

sum_other is c[1][1} (1) + c[0][2} (1) - c[1][2} (1) →1+1-1=1. k=-1-1 =-2 → count=3.

i=0, j=0:

sum_other is c[1][0} (-1) + c[0][1} (-1) - c[1][1} (1) →-1 + (-1) -1 =-3. k=1 - (-3) =4 → count=4.

So the total count is 4, which matches the sample.

Thus, the code works correctly.

Therefore, the code is correct.
