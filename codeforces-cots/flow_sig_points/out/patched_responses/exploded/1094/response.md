<think>
Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.

The problem is about determining the store's schedule based on some open and closed examples, and then answering queries about whether a specific time is open, closed, or unknown. Also, we need to check if the input data is consistent.

So the key here is to find the possible ranges xl, xr, yl, yr, zl, zr such that all the open entries are within these ranges and all the closed entries are outside. And then, for each query, check if it's inside all ranges (OPEN), outside any of them (CLOSED), or could be either (UNKNOWN).

First, the constraints. The maximum values for x, y, z can be up to 1e5. The number of open and closed entries can be up to 1e5 each, and the number of queries is up to 1e5. So we need an efficient way to process this data.

Let me think about the approach. For the store's schedule, the possible xl is the minimum x_i from the open entries, and xr is the maximum x_i from the open entries. Similarly for yl, yr, zl, zr. But wait, no— the store's ranges must include all the open entries. So the xl must be <= all open x's, and xr >= all open x's. Similarly for y and z. So the minimal possible xl is the minimum x of the open entries, and the maximal xr is the maximum x of the open entries. But wait, the actual xl could be smaller than that, and xr larger, as long as all open entries are within xl and xr. But the closed entries must not be in the ranges. Wait, no— the closed entries must not be in the store's working time. So for a closed entry (x, y, z), it must not satisfy (xl <= x <= xr) AND (yl <= y <= yr) AND (zl <= z <= zr). So the closed entries must lie outside at least one of the ranges.

So the problem reduces to finding the possible ranges [xl, xr], [yl, yr], [zl, zr] such that:

1. All open entries are within all three ranges (so xl <= x_i <=xr, etc. for all open entries)
2. For every closed entry, it is not in all three ranges. So for each closed entry, either x < xl, or x > xr, OR y < yl, or y > yr, OR z < zl, or z > zr.

If there's any closed entry that is inside all three ranges, then the data is inconsistent. Also, there's the possibility that the ranges derived from the open entries conflict with the closed entries.

Wait, but how to find the possible xl, xr, yl, yr, zl, zr that satisfy these conditions?

The first step is to compute the minimal possible ranges for the open entries. The minimal xl is the minimal x among all open entries, and the maximal xr is the maximal x among them. Similarly for y and z. Then, these ranges must be the minimal possible. Any larger ranges (xl' <= xl_min and xr' >= xr_max) would include all open entries. Wait, no. For example, if the open entries have x's ranging from 2 to 6, then xl can be 1 and xr 10, but as long as all open entries are covered. However, any such xl and xr must satisfy xl <= x_min and xr >= x_max. Wait, no. If x_min is the minimal x in open entries, then xl must be <= x_min, and xr >= x_max. Because if xl were greater than x_min, then x_min would not be in the range, which is impossible since that's an open entry. So the possible xl and xr must satisfy xl <= x_min and xr >= x_max. Wait, no. Because if xl is the minimal x in the open entries, then xl can't be larger than that. Wait, no. For example, if all open entries have x >= 2, then xl must be <= 2. So the maximum possible xl is the minimal x in the open entries. And the minimum possible xr is the maximal x in the open entries. So the possible ranges for x are xl ranges from 1 to x_min (the minimal x in open entries), and xr ranges from x_max (maximal x in open entries) to xmax (the maximum possible month). So the possible xl can be as low as 1, but not higher than x_min. Similarly, xr can be as high as xmax, but not lower than x_max.

Similarly for y and z.

So the ranges for x must be [xl, xr], where xl <= x_min and xr >= x_max. Same for y and z.

So the minimal xl is the minimal x in the open entries. The maximal xl is x_min. Wait, no. Wait, xl can be any value <= x_min. So for example, if x_min is 3, then xl can be 1, 2, or 3. So the possible xl's are in [1, x_min], and xr's are in [x_max, xmax].

So for the ranges, the possible xl is any value between 1 and x_min (inclusive), xr is any value between x_max and xmax (inclusive), and similarly for y and z.

Now, for the closed entries, each must not be inside all three ranges. So for each closed entry (x, y, z), it's required that either x < xl or x > xr, OR y < yl or y > yr, OR z < zl or z > zr. Because if all three are in their respective ranges, then that closed entry would be considered open by the store's schedule, which is a contradiction.

So, the problem is to find if there exists any possible xl, xr, yl, yr, zl, zr such that:

1. xl <= x_min and xr >= x_max
2. yl <= y_min and yr >= y_max
3. zl <= z_min and zr >= z_max
4. For all closed entries, (x < xl OR x > xr OR y < yl OR y > yr OR z < zl OR z > zr)

If such ranges exist, then the data is consistent. Otherwise, it's inconsistent.

But how to check if the closed entries are compatible with these possible ranges.

But the ranges can vary. For example, xl can be any value up to x_min, and xr can be any value >= x_max. So to check if the closed entries are all invalid (i.e., each is outside at least one of the ranges), we need to find if for every closed entry (x, y, z), there's at least one coordinate that is outside all possible ranges.

Wait, no. Because the ranges can vary. For a closed entry to be allowed, there must exist some ranges (xl, xr, etc.) such that this closed entry is not in all three ranges. So for each closed entry, there exists some ranges (allowed by the open entries) where the closed entry is excluded.

But for the data to be consistent, all closed entries must be excluded by some possible ranges that are allowed by the open entries.

Wait, no. The Martian's information must be compatible with some possible ranges. So the data is consistent if there exists at least one set of ranges (xl, xr, etc.) that includes all open entries and excludes all closed entries.

So the problem reduces to: does there exist xl, xr (with xl <= x_min, xr >= x_max), yl, yr (yl <= y_min, yr >= y_max), zl, zr (zl <= z_min, zr >= z_max), such that for every closed entry, either x < xl, x > xr, y < yl, y > yr, z < zl, or z > zr.

But how to check that? Because the ranges can vary, but must be within certain bounds.

An alternative approach is to compute the minimal possible ranges (xl = x_min, xr = x_max; similarly for y and z). Then, for all closed entries, check if any of them is inside all three ranges. If so, then even with the minimal ranges, that closed entry is in all ranges, which is a contradiction. So in that case, the data is invalid.

Wait, but maybe with a larger xl (smaller than x_min) or larger xr (greater than x_max), that closed entry can be excluded.

But the minimal ranges (xl = x_min, xr = x_max, etc.) is the most restrictive possible. Because any other allowed ranges would have xl <= x_min and xr >= x_max, which would make the ranges larger. So if a closed entry is inside the minimal ranges, then no possible ranges can exclude it. Because any ranges must include x_min and x_max for x, so xl <= x_min <= x <= x_max <= xr, meaning x is within xl and xr. Similarly for y and z. So if a closed entry is within the minimal x range (x_min <= x <= x_max), and same for y and z, then it's inside all possible ranges. Therefore, the closed entry must not be inside the minimal ranges for x, y, z. Otherwise, no possible ranges can exclude it, leading to inconsistency.

So the approach is:

1. Compute x_min, x_max as the min and max x among open entries. Similarly for y and z.

   If there are no open entries (n=0), then what? But according to the input constraints, n >=1. Because in the first line, n and m are given, and the problem statement says n is the number of times the store was open. So if n is 0, but according to input constraints, n is >=1. Wait, no, in the input constraints, n is given as 1<=n<=1e5. Wait, looking back: the input line says "1 ≤ n ≤ 1e5". So n can't be zero. So we can safely proceed.

2. Check if any closed entry (x, y, z) is such that x is in [x_min, x_max], y is in [y_min, y_max], and z is in [z_min, z_max]. Because if such a closed entry exists, then even the minimal ranges (xl = x_min, xr = x_max, etc.) would include it, making the data inconsistent. Because the closed entry would be in the store's open time, which is impossible.

So first, for all closed entries, check if any of them is inside the minimal ranges. If any is, then output is INCORRECT.

Otherwise, the data is consistent. Then, for each query, determine if it's OPEN (if it's inside the minimal ranges), CLOSED (if it's outside any of the ranges of the minimal ranges), or UNKNOWN (if it's inside the minimal ranges but not in all of them, but the actual ranges could be expanded).

Wait, no. Wait, the query can be OPEN only if it's inside all possible ranges. Because all possible ranges are xl <= x_min, xr >=x_max. So any point inside the minimal ranges (x >=x_min and <=x_max, etc.) will be included in all possible ranges. So those points must be OPEN.

For points outside the minimal ranges in any of the coordinates (x not in [x_min, x_max], y not in [y_min, y_max], or z not in [z_min, z_max]), then those points are definitely CLOSED. Because in the minimal ranges, they are outside, but since the actual ranges can be larger (xl <=x_min, xr >=x_max), but for the coordinates outside the minimal ranges, for example, x <x_min: the minimal xl is x_min. So x <x_min would be x <xl (since xl <=x_min). So any point with x <x_min is outside the x range (since xl can't be larger than x_min). So such points would be CLOSED.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Suppose the minimal x range is [x_min, x_max]. So any possible xl is <=x_min, xr >=x_max.

So for a point with x <x_min: in the minimal ranges, x is <x_min. But xl can be as low as 1. So if x is 3 and x_min is 5, then x is <xl (which is <=5). So x is outside the x range. But wait, xl can be 3, which is <=x_min (5), then x=3 is within xl=3 and xr >=x_max (say 10). So x=3 is in the x range.

Ah, right. So points that are not in the minimal ranges can still be inside some possible ranges.

Wait, this complicates things. So for example, a query point (x, y, z) where x is less than x_min. Then, if xl is set to x (which is <=x_min), then x is inside the x range. So this query point could be in the store's open time, depending on the ranges. So in this case, the answer would be UNKNOWN, unless the query is outside all possible ranges.

Wait, but how to determine for a query point whether it must be OPEN, must be CLOSED, or could be either.

So here's the correct approach:

For the query to be OPEN, it must be included in all possible ranges. The minimal ranges are the most restrictive. So if the query is inside the minimal ranges (x >=x_min and <=x_max; same for y and z), then in all possible ranges, it's included. Thus, the answer is OPEN.

For the query to be CLOSED, it must be excluded from all possible ranges. That is, in every possible ranges (xl <=x_min, xr >=x_max, etc.), the query is outside at least one range. How?

For example, if the query's x is greater than x_max, then for all possible xr >=x_max, xr can be x_max, x_max+1, etc. So the query's x is >=x_max. So if x is greater than x_max, then x is >=xr (since xr >=x_max) only if xr is <=x. But xr can be up to xmax. So if the query's x is >x_max, but <=xmax, then xr could be >=x, making x <=xr. So the x range would include x. Thus, the query could be in the x range. Therefore, to be CLOSED, the query's x must be greater than xmax (but xr can't exceed xmax, since xr can't be larger than xmax). Wait, no: according to the problem statement, xmax is the maximum possible month. So the possible xr ranges from x_max to xmax. So if the query's x is x_max+1, but xmax is, say, 10, then xr can't be larger than 10. So in that case, x is >x_max (which is <=xr), so x is <=xr (since xr >=x_max and x_max is <=xr). So if x is x_max+1 but xr is x_max, then x is >xr. So in that case, the query is excluded from the x range. But if xr is x_max+1 (but not exceeding xmax), then x is included in x's range.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to model the possible ranges:

For x:

xl can be any value from 1 to x_min (the minimal x in open entries).

xr can be any value from x_max (maximal x in open entries) up to xmax.

So the x ranges are [xl, xr], where xl <=x_min and xr >=x_max.

For a query point's x coordinate, to be in the x range of any possible schedule, it must satisfy xl <=x <=xr. Since xl can be as small as 1 and xr can be as large as xmax, then:

If x is >=x_min and <=x_max: then x is in all possible x ranges. So the x part is satisfied.

If x is <x_min: then x can be in x ranges if xl <=x (since xl can be as small as 1). For example, x is 3, x_min is 5: xl can be 3, 4, or 5. So x is in x ranges if xl <=3. So if x is 3 and x_min is 5, then xl can be 3, and x is in the x range. But xl can also be 5, in which case x=3 is not in the x range. So the query's x could be in the x range for some possible xl and xr, but not for others. So in this case, the x component could be included or excluded, depending on the ranges.

Similarly, if x is between x_max and xmax: then xr can be x_max, x_max+1, ..., up to xmax. So if x is x_max+5 (but <=xmax), then xr can be x_max+5, which includes x. So the x part is included.

Thus, for a query to be in the x range, it's possible if x is <=xmax and >=1. Because xl can be as low as 1 (if x_min is higher than 1), and xr can be up to xmax.

Wait, no. For example, xl can be up to x_min. So xl <=x_min. So if x is less than x_min, then xl can be up to x_min. So for example, x_min is 5. xl can be 3, which is <=5. So x=3 is >=xl (3) and <=xr (which is >=x_max). So x is in the x range.

So for any x <=xmax and >=1, it's possible for x to be in the x range. So the x component can be included in some possible ranges.

Wait, but xr must be >=x_max. So if x is greater than x_max but less than xr, then x is in the x range. So the x component is included.

So, for a query point (x, y, z), to be in the store's schedule, there must exist ranges xl, xr, yl, yr, zl, zr such that all open entries are covered, and the query is inside all three ranges.

But for the query to be CLOSED, it must be excluded from all possible ranges. That is, for all possible ranges (xl, xr, yl, yr, zl, zr) that are valid (include all open entries and exclude all closed entries), the query is outside at least one of the ranges.

But how to determine this.

Alternatively:

A query is OPEN if it is in all possible ranges. Which is only possible if it's in the minimal ranges (x between x_min and x_max, y between y_min and y_max, z between z_min and z_max). Because any possible ranges include the minimal ranges, so any point in the minimal ranges is in all possible ranges.

A query is CLOSED if it is excluded by all possible ranges. That is, there is no possible valid ranges where the query is included in all three ranges.

Otherwise, it's UNKNOWN.

So how to check for CLOSED.

The query is CLOSED if in all possible ranges, the query is excluded from at least one range.

But how to determine that.

To be CLOSED, the query must be excluded from all possible ranges. That is, for every possible xl <=x_min, xr >=x_max, etc., the query is not in xl..xr OR not in yl..yr OR not in zl..zr.

But that's difficult to check.

An alternative approach: The query is CLOSED if, even if we set the ranges to the maximum possible (xl=1, xr=xmax, yl=1, yr=ymax, zl=1, zr=zmax), the query is not in all three ranges.

Wait, no. Because the ranges must be xl <=x_min and xr >=x_max, etc. So the maximum possible ranges are xl=1, xr=xmax (but only if x_min >=1, which it is). Wait, x_min is the minimal x in the open entries, which is >=1. So xl can be as low as 1, xr as high as xmax. So the maximum possible x range is [1, xmax], but xr must be >=x_max. So if xmax (the xmax input) is larger than x_max (the max x in open entries), then xr can be up to xmax. So the maximum possible x range is [1, xmax].

But in any case, for a query to be CLOSED, it must be excluded from all possible valid ranges. So for example, if the query's x is greater than xmax (the input xmax), then even in the maximum possible xr (xmax), x is outside xr. So for any possible xr >=x_max (which can't exceed xmax), the query's x would be >xr. So x is outside the x range. Thus, the query is CLOSED.

Similarly, if the query's x is less than 1 (but according to the problem, all input x's are >=1, so this is not possible).

Alternatively, the query is CLOSED if any of the following is true:

x < xl_min (xl can be as low as 1, so x <1 is impossible. So if x is <1, it's CLOSED. But according to input constraints, x is >=1.)

Or, x >xr_max (xr can be as high as xmax, so if x >xmax, then it's excluded. So any x >xmax is CLOSED.

Similarly, y >ymax, z >zmax, etc. Or, if x is <x_min and there exists a closed entry that has x >=x_min, but that's not part of the CLOSED condition.

Wait, no. To determine if the query is CLOSED, we need to see if for all possible valid ranges, the query is excluded. Which is equivalent to the query not being in any possible valid ranges. Which can be rephrased as the query is excluded in all possible valid ranges.

But how?

Alternative approach for CLOSED:

The query is CLOSED if, even in the most permissive possible ranges (xl=1, xr=xmax, yl=1, yr=ymax, zl=1, zr=zmax), the query is not in all three ranges. Because the most permissive ranges include the largest possible ranges. So if the query is not in those, then it's CLOSED. Otherwise, it could be in some ranges.

Wait, but the most permissive ranges are xl=1, xr=xmax, but xr must be >=x_max. So if x_max is 5 and xmax is 10, then xr can be 10. So the most permissive x range is [1, 10]. So if the query's x is in [x_min, x_max], then it's definitely in the x ranges of all possible valid ranges. If the query's x is in [1, x_min) or (x_max, xmax], then it's possible to be included in some x ranges.

Wait, but the query's x could be in [1, x_min), and the xl is set to 1 (since xl can be as low as 1), so x is >=xl. And xr is >=x_max, which is >=x. So x is <=xr. So the x part is included. So the query's x is in the x range. So in the most permissive ranges (xl=1, xr=xmax), the query is included in the x range. So for the query to be CLOSED, it must be excluded from at least one range in all possible valid ranges. But if in the most permissive ranges, the query is included in all ranges, then there exists a valid range where the query is included. So the query can't be CLOSED. Therefore, the query can only be CLOSED if in the most permissive ranges, the query is excluded from at least one range.

Wait, let's think:

If the query is excluded from the most permissive ranges (xl=1, xr=xmax; yl=1, yr=ymax; zl=1, zr=zmax), then it is excluded from all possible ranges. Because all other possible ranges are subsets of the most permissive ranges. So if the query is not in the most permissive ranges, then in any other valid ranges (which are subsets), the query is also not in them. So in this case, the query is CLOSED.

Otherwise, if the query is included in the most permissive ranges, then there exists at least one valid ranges where it is included (the most permissive ones). So the query is not CLOSED. It could be OPEN (if it's in the minimal ranges) or UNKNOWN (if it's in the permissive ranges but not the minimal ones).

So the steps for each query are:

1. Check if the query is in the minimal ranges (x_min <=x <=x_max, etc.). If yes: OPEN.

2. Else, check if the query is in the most permissive ranges (x between 1 and xmax, etc.). If not: CLOSED.

3. Else: UNKNOWN.

Because:

- If the query is in the minimal ranges, it's OPEN.

- If the query is not in the most permissive ranges, it's CLOSED.

- Else, it's in the most permissive ranges but not in the minimal. So there exists some ranges (like the most permissive ones) where it's included, but also possible ranges where it's excluded. So the answer is UNKNOWN.

So to summarize:

For each query (x, y, z):

- If x is between x_min and x_max (inclusive), y between y_min and y_max, z between z_min and z_max → OPEN.

- Else if x is not between 1 and xmax (excluded), OR y not between 1 and ymax, OR z not between 1 and zmax → CLOSED.

- Else → UNKNOWN.

Wait, but the permissive ranges are xl=1 (since x_min >=1), xr=xmax (since x_max <=xmax). So the permissive x range is [1, xmax]. So if the query's x is within [1, xmax], then x is in the x range of the permissive ranges.

So the permissive ranges check is whether x is in [1, xmax], y in [1, ymax], z in [1, zmax]. If not, then CLOSED.

So the steps are:

For a query (xq, yq, zq):

Check if xq is within [x_min, x_max], yq within [y_min, y_max], zq within [z_min, z_max]. If all are true → OPEN.

Else, check if xq is not in [1, xmax] → CLOSED.

OR yq not in [1, ymax] → CLOSED.

OR zq not in [1, zmax] → CLOSED.

If any of these are true → CLOSED.

Else → UNKNOWN.

Because if xq is in [1, xmax], yq in [1, ymax], zq in [1, zmax], but not in the minimal ranges, then it's possible that there exist ranges (like the permissive ones) where the query is included (so OPEN in that case), but other ranges where it's excluded. So the answer is UNKNOWN.

So this gives us the way to process queries.

Now, the code steps:

First, process the open entries:

Collect all x's from open entries, compute x_min and x_max. Similarly for y and z.

Then, process all closed entries. For each closed entry (x, y, z), check whether x is in [x_min, x_max], y in [y_min, y_max], z in [z_min, z_max]. If all three are true → the closed entry is inside the minimal ranges, which is a contradiction. So output INCORRECT.

If any closed entry is inside the minimal ranges, the data is invalid.

Otherwise, proceed.

Then, process each query:

For each query (x, y, z):

Check if x is between x_min and x_max (inclusive), y between y_min and y_max, z between z_min and z_max → OPEN.

Else, check if x is outside [1, xmax], or y outside [1, ymax], or z outside [1, zmax] → CLOSED.

Else → UNKNOWN.

So the code needs to:

- Read all open entries, compute x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max.

- Check closed entries: for each, check if x is between x_min and x_max, y between y_min and y_max, and z between z_min and z_max. If any such closed entry exists, output INCORRECT.

Else, process queries.

So the code steps in Python:

Read xmax, ymax, zmax, n, m, k.

Read n open entries. Collect x's, y's, z's.

Compute x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max.

Read m closed entries. For each, check if x in [x_min, x_max], y in [y_min, y_max], z in [z_min, z_max]. If all three are true → invalid.

If any closed entry is invalid → output INCORRECT.

Else, read k queries. For each query:

Check if x between x_min and x_max, etc. → OPEN.

Else if x not in 1..xmax, etc. → CLOSED.

Else → UNKNOWN.

Now, edge cases:

What if n=0? But according to input constraints, n >=1. So no problem.

What if all open entries are the same? Then x_min = x_max, etc.

What about when x_min is 1? Then xl can be 1. So the x ranges start at 1.

Now, code optimization:

Reading up to 1e5 entries for open and closed. So we need to read them efficiently.

In Python, using sys.stdin to read input is faster. So read all input at once.

But for code submission, the standard approach is to read via input() or sys.stdin.

But for speed, it's better to read via sys.stdin.read() and split into a list.

So here's the plan for code:

Read the entire input as a list of integers.

Process them in order.

For example, read all data as a list data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split())).

Then, process the data sequentially.

This is more efficient than reading line by line.

So the code steps:

import sys

data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))
ptr = 0

xmax = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
ymax = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
zmax = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
n = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
m = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
k = data[ptr]; ptr +=1

open_x = []
open_y = []
open_z = []

for _ in range(n):
    x = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
    y = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
    z = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
    open_x.append(x)
    open_y.append(y)
    open_z.append(z)

x_min = min(open_x)
x_max = max(open_x)
y_min = min(open_y)
y_max = max(open_y)
z_min = min(open_z)
z_max = max(open_z)

invalid = False

for _ in range(m):
    x = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
    y = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
    z = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
    # check if x is in [x_min, x_max], y in [y_min, y_max], z in [z_min, z_max]
    if (x_min <= x <= x_max) and (y_min <= y <= y_max) and (z_min <= z <= z_max):
        invalid = True

if invalid:
    print("INCORRECT")
else:
    print("CORRECT")
    for _ in range(k):
        x = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
        y = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
        z = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
        # check for OPEN
        if (x_min <= x <= x_max) and (y_min <= y <= y_max) and (z_min <= z <= z_max):
            print("OPEN")
        else:
            # check if any coordinate is out of the global max
            if x <1 or x >xmax or y <1 or y >ymax or z <1 or z >zmax:
                print("CLOSED")
            else:
                print("UNKNOWN")

This code seems correct.

Now, test it against the sample inputs.

First sample input:

10 10 10 3 1 3

Open entries:

2 6 2 → x=2, y=6, z=2

4 2 4 → x=4, y=2, z=4

6 4 6 → x=6, y=4, z=6

So x_min=2, x_max=6.

y_min is min(6,2,4) =2.

y_max is max(6,2,4)=6.

z_min=2, z_max=6.

Closed entries: 9 9 9.

Check if x is between 2-6 (9 is not), so no. So no invalid.

Queries:

3 3 3 → x is 3 (between 2-6), y is 3 (2-6), z 3 (2-6) → OPEN → printed.

10 10 10 → x is 10 >xmax (10?), xmax is 10. x is 10 <=xmax. So check for CLOSED: x is 10, which is <=xmax, y 10 <=ymax=10, z 10 <=zmax=10. So it's not in the minimal ranges (x_max is 6, so 10>6). So check if it's in the permissive ranges (x between 1-10, yes). So then, check if x is between x_min and x_max (3 is, but 10 is not). So the condition for CLOSED is if x is outside 1-10, etc. For this query, x=10 is within 1-10. So not CLOSED. So check if any of x, y, z is outside their global max. x is 10 (==xmax), so no. So it's UNKNOWN? Wait, no.

Wait, the query is (10,10,10). x is 10 which is in [1,10], y in [1,10], z in [1,10]. So not CLOSED.

But why in the sample output, it's CLOSED.

Wait the first sample input:

Queries:

3 3 3 → OPEN (as expected)

10 10 10 → CLOSED

8 8 8 → UNKNOWN

But according to the code's logic:

For the query 10,10,10:

x is 10, which is <=xmax (10), y and z also same. So the code checks if x is between x_min (2) and x_max (6). 10>6 → no. So it's not OPEN. Then checks if any coordinate is outside global max. x is 10 ==xmax → no. So code proceeds to else → UNKNOWN. But according to the sample, the output is CLOSED.

This indicates a mistake in the code.

Wait, what's wrong here. Let me re-examine the sample explanation.

Sample input:

The closed entry is 9,9,9. Which is in the permissive ranges, but the code says that's not invalid. But according to the code's logic, the closed entry is checked against the minimal ranges. 9 is x=9, which is not in [2,6], so the code allows it. So data is valid.

For the query 10,10,10:

The code says it's not in the minimal ranges. So check if any coordinate is outside the global ranges (xmax=10, so x=10 is okay). So code outputs UNKNOWN, but sample expects CLOSED.

Ah, here's the mistake. The code's logic for CLOSED is incorrect.

Wait, according to the sample explanation:

The second query is 10,10,10. The store's schedule requires that xr >=x_max (6). But xr can be up to xmax (10). So the store's x range is xl <=6, xr >=6. For example, xl=2, xr=10. The query x is 10 is in [2,10]. But the closed entry is 9,9,9. The code allowed that closed entry because it's not in the minimal ranges (9 is not between 2 and 6). But according to the problem statement, the store's schedule could have xl=2 and xr=10. Then, the closed entry 9,9,9 would be inside xl..xr (9 is between 2 and 10), but in the closed entry's check, the code says it's allowed because in the minimal ranges, it's excluded. But according to the problem, the closed entry must be excluded in all possible valid ranges.

Wait, but the code's approach is wrong. The code checks if any closed entry is in the minimal ranges and if so, outputs INCORRECT. But that's not sufficient. Because even if a closed entry is not in the minimal ranges, but in some other possible ranges, then it would be allowed, but the closed entry must be excluded in all possible ranges.

Wait, no. The code's approach is correct. The code checks if there's any closed entry that is in the minimal ranges. Because if that's the case, then even in the minimal ranges (which are part of all possible ranges), the closed entry is included, which is a contradiction. So the code correctly outputs INCORRECT in that case.

But in the first sample, the code correctly does not output INCORRECT because the closed entry 9,9,9 is x=9, which is >x_max=6, so it's excluded from the x range in the minimal ranges. So no closed entry is invalid.

But then for the query 10,10,10: according to the sample's explanation, it's CLOSED because the store's schedule could have xr=6 (the minimal xr). So x=10 is >xr=6 → CLOSED.

But according to the code's logic, the code would output UNKNOWN, but the sample expects CLOSED.

What's wrong here?

Ah, the code's logic for CLOSED is incorrect. Because in this case, the query's x is 10, which is <=xmax=10. So the code checks if x is between 1 and xmax (10 is yes). So the code would output UNKNOWN. But according to the sample, the query is CLOSED.

So why is the sample's query 10,10,10 CLOSED?

Because according to the sample's explanation, the store is closed at 9,9,9. Which implies that the store's xr cannot be >=9. Because if xr >=9, then the closed entry's x=9 is within xl <=x <=xr. But the closed entry must be excluded. So for the store's xr to exclude x=9, xr must be <9. But xr must be >=x_max (6). So xr can be 6,7,8. Then, for the query x=10, which is >xr (<=8), so x is outside the x range → CLOSED.

But according to the code's logic, the code would think that the query is in the permissive ranges (x=10 is <=xmax=10), so it's possible for xr to be 10, making x=10 part of the x range. But in that case, the closed entry 9,9,9 would be in x=9, which is between xl=2 and xr=10. So the closed entry would be in the store's working time, which is invalid. But the code's check for closed entries only checks if they are in the minimal ranges (which x=9 is not). So the code allows that closed entry.

But in reality, the closed entry 9,9,9 must be excluded in all possible valid ranges. So when the code allows it, the closed entry is allowed, but in reality, it's possible to have a valid range where the closed entry is inside, leading to inconsistency.

So the code's approach is incorrect. Because the code only checks if closed entries are in the minimal ranges. But there may be other possible ranges where a closed entry is included, leading to inconsistency.

So the initial approach is wrong.

So the correct way to check for consistency is to determine if there exists a possible set of ranges (xl, xr, yl, yr, zl, zr) that includes all open entries and excludes all closed entries.

But how to check that?

The initial approach assumed that if no closed entry is in the minimal ranges, then there exists a possible set of ranges. But this is not sufficient.

For example, consider a closed entry that is in x >=x_min but <=x_max. Wait, no. Because x_min is the minimal x in the open entries. So x_max is the maximal. So any closed entry with x in [x_min, x_max] would be in the minimal x range. So the code's initial approach checks for that.

But what about closed entries that are not in the minimal ranges, but could be included in some other ranges?

For example, open entries have x in [2, 6]. So x_min=2, x_max=6. The possible x ranges are [xl, xr] where xl <=2 and xr >=6.

Now, a closed entry has x=5. Then, x is in [2,6], which is the minimal x range. So the code would detect it as invalid.

But a closed entry x=7. x is not in the minimal x range (2-6). So the code allows it. But if the store's xr is 7 (which is >=6), then the closed entry's x=7 is in the x range. So if there's a closed entry x=7, y=yl..yr, z=zl..zr, then the closed entry would be in the store's time, leading to inconsistency.

Wait, but the closed entry's y and z must be in their respective ranges as well.

So for a closed entry to be in the store's time, all three coordinates must be within their ranges.

So the closed entry x=7, y=3, z=3. Suppose the store's xr=7 (allowed as xr >=6). Then x=7 is in x range. But for the closed entry to be invalid, it must also be in y and z ranges. So if the y ranges are [yl, yr] where yl <= y_min (the minimal y in open entries) and yr >= y_max. Suppose the open entries have y_min=2 and y_max=6. So y ranges are [yl, yr] where yl <=2 and yr >=6. So for the closed entry's y=3, it's between 2 and 6. So y is in the y range. Similarly, z. So the closed entry x=7, y=3, z=3 would be in the store's time if xr >=7, and y ranges include 3. Which is possible.

Thus, this closed entry would be in the store's time, which is a contradiction. So the data is invalid. But the code's initial approach would not detect this, because x=7 is not in the minimal x range (2-6). But the code's initial approach only checks if closed entries are in all minimal ranges. So this would not be detected, leading to a wrong answer.

So the initial approach is incorrect. The code's approach is wrong.

Thus, the initial approach is flawed. We need a different method.

So the problem is: the code's initial approach checks only if closed entries are in the minimal ranges. But closed entries can be in some other possible ranges, leading to inconsistency.

Thus, the approach must be adjusted.

The correct approach is to check that for every closed entry, there exists at least one coordinate that is outside all possible ranges.

So for a closed entry (x, y, z), for the data to be consistent, at least one of the following must be true:

Either x is < xl (for all possible xl), OR x >xr (for all possible xr), OR similarly for y or z.

But since xl can be as low as 1, and xr can be as high as xmax, the possible ranges for x are xl <=x_min and xr >=x_max.

Thus, the closed entry's x must satisfy either:

x < all possible xl → x <1 (but x >=1 per input constraints → impossible).

OR x > all possible xr → x >xmax → yes. Because xr can be up to xmax. So if x >xmax, then x> xr → closed.

OR, similarly for y and z.

Alternatively, for the closed entry to be excluded in all possible ranges, at least one of its coordinates must be outside the possible ranges for that coordinate.

For x, possible ranges are [xl, xr], where xl <=x_min, xr >=x_max. So x can be outside all possible ranges in x if:

x < xl (but xl can be as low as 1 → x <1 is impossible, since x >=1).

OR x >xr (xr can be as high as xmax → x >xmax is possible. So if x >xmax, then in all possible xr, xr <=xmax → x >xr. So x is excluded from x ranges.

Thus, for a closed entry to be excluded in x ranges, x must be >xmax.

OR for y: y <yl (yl can be as low as 1 → y <1 is impossible), OR y> ymax (closed if y> ymax).

OR for z: same.

Alternatively, for the closed entry to be excluded in x ranges, it must be x <x_min (because xl can be as low as 1 up to x_min. So if x <x_min, then x is <xl only if xl >x. But xl can be any value <=x_min. So for example, if x is 3 and x_min is 5, then xl can be 3, 4, or 5. So x is >=xl (3) in that case. So x is in the x range. So in this case, x=3 is included in the x ranges for xl=3, which is allowed. So the closed entry would be in the x range. Thus, it's allowed only if x <x_min is not sufficient.

Wait, this is getting complicated. The correct way to ensure that a closed entry is excluded in all possible ranges is that the closed entry is excluded in every possible valid range. So for any valid ranges (xl <=x_min, xr >=x_max, etc.), the closed entry is excluded.

So for the closed entry to be excluded in all possible ranges, there must be at least one coordinate where the closed entry's value is outside of all possible ranges for that coordinate.

So for x:

Possible x ranges are [xl, xr], xl <=x_min, xr >=x_max.

The closed entry's x must be excluded from all possible x ranges → for any xl and xr, x <xl OR x >xr.

Which can only happen if x <1 (impossible) OR x >xr for all xr >=x_max. Since xr >=x_max, x >xr implies x >x_max. But xr can be as high as xmax. So x must be >xmax. Because if x is <=xmax, then there exists xr >=x_max (possibly up to xmax) that includes x. So for example, x_max=5, xmax=10, x=7. Then xr can be 10 (xr=10 >=5), so x=7 is in the x range. So the closed entry is in the store's time, leading to inconsistency.

Thus, for a closed entry to be excluded from all x ranges, x must be >xmax.

Similarly, x <xl can't happen since xl can be as low as 1, so x >=1.

Similarly for y and z: y must be >ymax or y <1 (impossible), or z >zmax or z <1 (impossible).

Thus, the only way for a closed entry to be excluded in all possible ranges is if at least one of the coordinates is:

x >xmax OR y> ymax OR z> zmax.

OR:

x <x_min (but this is not sufficient, because xl could be <=x).

Wait, no. For example, x is 3, x_min is 5. xl can be 3, 4, 5. So x=3 is <=x_min (5). So x=3 is in the x range (xl=3, xr >=5). So x=3 is in the x range. Thus, the closed entry's x is 3 is in the x range. So the closed entry would be in the store's time, leading to inconsistency. So the code's initial approach is wrong.

Thus, the correct way to check consistency is:

For each closed entry (x, y, z), the closed entry must satisfy at least one of the following:

x >xmax → xr can't be >=x_max and >=x (since xr >=x_max but x> xmax → xr can't be >=x if xmax is the maximum possible x). So x> xmax → excluded.

OR y> ymax → excluded.

OR z> zmax → excluded.

OR x <x_min → no, because xl can be as low as 1, which is <=x_min. So x >=1. So x can be in x ranges.

OR x >x_max → but x_max <=xr, which can be up to xmax. So if x_max <x <=xmax, then xr can be x, which is >=x_max, so x is included.

Similarly for y and z.

Thus, the only way a closed entry can be excluded in all possible ranges is if at least one of the following is true:

x >xmax OR y> ymax OR z> zmax.

OR x <x_min → but xl can be <=x_min. For example, xl = x (if x <=x_min). So x is in the x range.

Wait, if x is less than x_min, then xl can be x. For example, x=3, x_min=5. So xl can be 3 (<=5), and xr >=5. So x=3 is in the x range. So the closed entry would be included in the x range, thus the store's time. So the closed entry is allowed, which is invalid.

Thus, the closed entry must not be included in any possible ranges. So the only way for a closed entry to be excluded from all possible ranges is if at least one of x> xmax, y> ymax, z> zmax.

Thus, the code's initial approach is wrong. Because it's possible for closed entries to be included in some ranges, leading to inconsistency.

Thus, the correct way to check for consistency is: for every closed entry, at least one of the coordinates must be greater than the global maximum (xmax, ymax, zmax), or less than 1 (but according to input constraints, coordinates are >=1). So for each closed entry, check if x> xmax or y> ymax or z> zmax.

But this is not sufficient. Because a closed entry could be excluded by another coordinate.

For example, a closed entry x=5 (xmax=10), y=10 (ymax=10), z=10 (zmax=10). But if the store's ranges are xl=6, xr=10, then x=5 is excluded. So this closed entry is allowed.

But in code's initial approach, it's allowed.

But according to the correct approach, this closed entry is allowed.

Thus, the code's initial approach is not sufficient. The correct approach is to check for each closed entry that it is excluded in all possible ranges. Which is equivalent to that for each closed entry, at least one of the following is true:

x >xmax OR y> ymax OR z> zmax OR x <x_min OR y <y_min OR z <z_min.

Wait, no. Because even if x is <x_min, the xl can be <=x. So x can be in x ranges.

So, for example, x=3, x_min=5. xl can be 3, which is <=5. So x=3 is in x ranges.

Thus, the closed entry would be included, which is invalid.

Thus, the correct way to check for closed entries is to ensure that for each closed entry, there exists at least one coordinate where it is outside of all possible ranges for that coordinate.

Which means:

For x: closed entry's x is either <x_min and all possible xl are >=x (so x <xl) → impossible, since xl can be as low as 1. So x <x_min but x >=1. Thus, xl can be 1, which is <=x_min, and x >=xl. So x is in x ranges. So this is not possible.

OR x >xmax → x is excluded from all x ranges (since xr >=x_max and xr <=xmax).

For y: similarly.

For z: similarly.

Thus, the only way a closed entry can be excluded from all possible ranges is if x> xmax OR y> ymax OR z> zmax.

Thus, the correct approach is: for each closed entry, check if x> xmax OR y> ymax OR z> zmax. If not, then the closed entry could be included in some possible ranges, leading to inconsistency.

Thus, the code's initial approach is wrong. The correct approach is to check that all closed entries have at least one coordinate greater than the global maximum.

So the code needs to:

For each closed entry (x, y, z):

if x >xmax or y> ymax or z> zmax → OK.

Else → data is inconsistent.

Thus, the code's logic for checking closed entries is incorrect. It should check if any closed entry has x in [x_min, x_max], y in [y_min, y_max], and z in [z_min, z_max], OR if none of the coordinates is > the global max.

Wait, no. The correct check is:

For each closed entry, if (x is not >xmax AND y is not >ymax AND z is not >zmax) AND the closed entry is in some possible ranges (i.e., there exists ranges xl <=x_min, xr >=x_max, etc., such that the closed entry is in all ranges). In that case, the data is inconsistent.

Thus, the correct check is:

For each closed entry, if (x is <=xmax AND y <=ymax AND z <=zmax) AND (x >=x_min OR x <=x_max) ... no, that's not the right way.

Alternatively, the closed entry is included in some possible ranges.

The closed entry is included in some possible ranges if and only if:

x >=x_min (since xl can be as low as 1 up to x_min) and x <=x_max (since xr can be >=x_max). Wait, no: x >=x_min (xl <=x_min) → x >=xl → x is in x ranges.

x <=x_max (xr >=x_max → x <=x_max <=xr → x is in x ranges.

So if x is between x_min and x_max, then x is in x ranges for all possible ranges.

But if x is <x_min, then x can be in x ranges if xl <=x.

For example, x=3, x_min=5. xl can be 3 (<=5), so x is in x ranges.

Similarly, x=5, x_min=5 → x is in x ranges.

x=6, x_max=5, xmax=10 → xr can be 6 (>=5), so x=6 is in x ranges.

Thus, for a closed entry to be included in some possible ranges, it's sufficient that x is <=xmax, y <=ymax, z <=zmax.

Because if x <=xmax, then xr can be set to xmax (>=x_max), so x is in x ranges. Similarly for y and z.

Thus, the data is inconsistent if there exists a closed entry with x <=xmax, y <=ymax, z <=zmax, and x >=x_min (since xl can be up to x_min, so x >=xl), and x <=x_max (since xr can be >=x_max, so x <=xr), and similarly for y and z.

But wait, that's not correct.

Wait, let's think of a closed entry that is in x <=xmax, y <=ymax, z <=zmax, but x <x_min. Then, xl can be set to x, which is <=x_min. So x is in x ranges. So if the closed entry's y and z are within their ranges, then the closed entry is included in the store's time, leading to inconsistency.

Thus, the data is inconsistent if there exists a closed entry that is in x <=xmax, y <=ymax, z <=zmax, and x >=xl (possible xl is up to x_min), and y >= yl (possible yl up to y_min), and z >= zl (possible zl up to z_min), and x <=xr (>=x_max), and y <=yr (>=y_max), and z <=zr (>=z_max).

But how to check that.

Alternatively, for a closed entry to be included in some possible ranges, it's possible if:

x >= xl (possible xl can be as low as 1) and x <=xr (possible xr can be as high as xmax).

Similarly for y and z.

Thus, the closed entry is included in some possible ranges if x is between 1 and xmax, y between 1 and ymax, z between 1 and zmax.

In such cases, the closed entry is included in the store's time for some possible ranges. Thus, the data is inconsistent.

Thus, the code should check for each closed entry: if all of the following are true:

x <=xmax AND y <=ymax AND z <=zmax.

AND x >=x_min (since xl can be up to x_min, so x >=xl)

AND y >=y_min (yl <=y_min)

AND z >=z_min (zl <=z_min)

AND x <=x_max (xr >=x_max, which is >=x_max)

AND y <=y_max (yr >=y_max)

AND z <=z_max (zr >=z_max)

If all of these are true, then the closed entry is included in the minimal ranges, leading to inconsistency. But even if not in the minimal ranges, the closed entry could be included in other ranges.

Wait, no. If the closed entry's x is <x_min, but x >=xl (xl can be as low as 1), then x is in x ranges. Similarly, if x is between x_max and xmax, then x is in x ranges (xr >=x_max).

Thus, for a closed entry to be included in some possible ranges, it's sufficient that:

x is between 1 and xmax,

y between 1 and ymax,

z between 1 and zmax.

Because the ranges can be set to xl=1, xr=xmax (if x_max <=xmax), yl=1, yr=ymax, zl=1, zr=zmax. In this case, the closed entry is included in all ranges, leading to inconsistency.

Thus, the code's initial approach is wrong. The correct approach is to check that all closed entries are outside the global ranges (x> xmax, y> ymax, z> zmax) or have at least one coordinate outside the global ranges.

Thus, the code should check for each closed entry:

if x <=xmax and y <=ymax and z <=zmax → the closed entry is inside the global ranges. Thus, the data is inconsistent.

But this is not correct, because the store's ranges could be such that the closed entry is excluded.

For example, closed entry x=7, x_max=5, xmax=10. x is <=xmax=10. But the store's xr is 5 (since xr >=x_max=5), so x=7 is >xr=5 → excluded.

So in this case, the closed entry is in the global ranges (x<=xmax) but is excluded in some possible ranges.

Thus, the code must not consider such closed entries as invalid.

Thus, the problem is much more complex than initially thought.

Thus, the initial approach is incorrect. The correct way to check for consistency is to find ranges xl, xr, yl, yr, zl, zr such that:

1. xl <=x_min, xr >=x_max.

2. yl <=y_min, yr >=y_max.

3. zl <=z_min, zr >=z_max.

4. For all closed entries (x, y, z), at least one of the following is true:

   x <xl OR x> xr OR y <yl OR y> yr OR z <zl OR z> zr.

But how to find such ranges xl, xr, etc.

But the ranges xl can be any value up to x_min, and xr any value >=x_max.

The problem is to find if there exists such ranges that exclude all closed entries.

This is a problem that requires checking the existence of such ranges.

But how?

The approach would be:

- For the open entries, compute x_min and x_max.

- For the closed entries, we need to find ranges xl <=x_min, xr >=x_max, etc., such that each closed entry is outside at least one range.

But how to find such ranges.

But given that xl can be as small as 1, xr as large as xmax, etc., the problem reduces to checking whether for each closed entry, there exists at least one coordinate where it is outside the possible ranges of that coordinate.

But since the possible ranges for x are xl <=x_min and xr >=x_max, for a closed entry to be excluded in x, it must have x <xl (but xl can be as low as 1) OR x> xr (but xr can be as large as xmax).

But x> xr implies x> xmax (since xr >=x_max and <=xmax). So x> xmax is the only way for x to be excluded in x ranges.

Similarly, for y and z.

Thus, the only way for a closed entry to be excluded in x ranges is x> xmax.

Thus, the data is consistent only if for every closed entry, at least one of x> xmax, y> ymax, z> zmax.

Because then, in all possible ranges, the closed entry is excluded.

But this is not the case. Because a closed entry could have x=7, x_max=5, xmax=10. Then, x> x_max (5) but <=xmax (10). But in this case, xr can be set to 5 (xr >=x_max=5), and x=7 is >xr=5 → excluded. So the closed entry is excluded.

But according to the previous reasoning, the code's initial approach would not check this.

Thus, the correct way to check for consistency is:

For each closed entry (x, y, z):

The data is consistent if and only if, for that closed entry, at least one of the following is true:

x < xl (for all possible xl) → impossible since xl can be 1.

OR x> xr (for all possible xr) → x> xmax.

OR y < yl → impossible.

OR y> yr → y> ymax.

OR z < zl → impossible.

OR z> zr → z> zmax.

OR, for the closed entry to be excluded in x ranges, x must be >xmax.

OR in y ranges, y> ymax.

OR in z ranges, z> zmax.

But there's another possibility: the closed entry is excluded in x ranges because x < xl. But xl can be as low as 1. So x < xl is only possible if x <1, which is impossible.

Thus, the only way for a closed entry to be excluded in x ranges is x> xmax.

Similarly for y and z.

Thus, the data is consistent if and only if all closed entries have x> xmax OR y> ymax OR z> zmax.

Thus, the code's initial approach is wrong. The correct approach is to check for each closed entry whether it is outside the global ranges (x> xmax, etc.), and if any closed entry is inside (x<=xmax and y <=ymax and z <=zmax), the data is inconsistent.

Thus, the code should be modified as follows:

Read all closed entries.

For each closed entry, if x <=xmax and y <=ymax and z <=zmax → invalid.

Because such a closed entry can be included in some ranges (like xl=1, xr=xmax, etc.), leading to inconsistency.

Thus, the code should output INCORRECT if any closed entry has x <=xmax, y <=ymax, z <=zmax.

But this is not correct, because even if a closed entry is inside the global ranges, it can be excluded by some ranges.

For example, closed entry x=7, x_max=5, xmax=10.

x=7 is <=xmax (10). But in this case, xr can be set to 5 (x_max=5). Thus, x=7 is >xr=5 → excluded.

Thus, the closed entry is allowed.

But according to the code's modified approach, this closed entry would be considered invalid, which is incorrect.

Thus, this approach is also wrong.

Thus, the problem requires a different approach.

The correct approach is to find the minimal possible xl and xr, and for each closed entry, check if it can be excluded by some possible ranges.

But this is computationally expensive.

Alternative approach:

The data is consistent if and only if all closed entries are excluded by the minimal possible ranges. Because the minimal ranges are the most restrictive. If a closed entry is not excluded by the minimal ranges, then it can't be excluded by any other ranges.

Wait, no. The minimal ranges are [x_min, x_max], [y_min, y_max], [z_min, z_max]. The store's ranges must include all open entries, so xl <=x_min and xr >=x_max.

Thus, the minimal ranges are the smallest possible x ranges. If a closed entry is inside the minimal ranges for x, y, and z, then it is included in the store's time for any possible ranges, which is a contradiction.

Thus, the code's initial approach is correct for checking if any closed entry is inside the minimal ranges.

But for closed entries outside the minimal ranges, but inside the global ranges, it's possible that they are included in some ranges and excluded in others. So the data is consistent as long as there exists at least one range that excludes them.

Thus, the code's initial approach is correct.

But according to the sample input, the code's initial approach produces the wrong answer.

Wait, let's look at the first sample input:

Open entries:

x_min=2, x_max=6, y_min=2, y_max=6, z_min=2, z_max=6.

Closed entry: 9,9,9. x=9 is not in [2,6] → not in x ranges. So code's initial approach allows it.

Queries:

10,10,10 → code's logic says that x=10 is in [1,10], y=10 in [1,10], z=10 in [1,10]. So code outputs UNKNOWN, but sample expects CLOSED.

Why?

Because according to the sample explanation, the closed entry is 9,9,9. The store's schedule must have ranges that exclude 9,9,9. For example, xr=8. But xr must be >=x_max=6, so xr can be 6,7,8,9,10. If xr=8, then x=9 is >xr → excluded.

But for the query 10,10,10, the x is 10, which is >x_max=6 and <=xmax=10. So xr can be 6,7,...,10. If xr=6, then x=10 is excluded. If xr=10, then x=10 is included. Thus, the query could be included or excluded. So the code's logic of outputting UNKNOWN is correct. But the sample says CLOSED.

But the sample's explanation says:

Query 10,10,10 is CLOSED because it is closed even in the month 9. But how?

The closed entry is 9,9,9. The store's schedule must exclude this closed entry, which requires that at least one coordinate is outside the ranges.

But the closed entry's x=9 is >x_max=6, so xr can be 6 → x=9> xr=6 → excluded.

Thus, the store's xr must be <=9-1=8. Because if xr=8, then x=9 is excluded.

But xr must be >=x_max=6. So xr can be 6,7,8,9,10.

But if the store's xr is set to 8, then the query's x=10 is excluded → CLOSED.

But how can the code know that all possible valid ranges exclude the query's x=10?

It can't. Because the store's xr can be 10, which includes x=10.

Thus, the sample's explanation is incorrect. Or perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.

No, the sample's explanation says that the query 10,10,10 is CLOSED because the store is closed even in month 9. But the closed entry 9,9,9 is excluded because x=9 is >x_max=6. So the store's xr can be 6. Thus, x=9 is excluded, and x=10 is also excluded. But if the store's xr is 6, then x=10 is excluded. If xr is 10, then x=10 is included.

But the data allows xr to be anything >=6. So there exists ranges where x=10 is excluded (xr=6) and ranges where it's included (xr=10). So the query's status is UNKNOWN.

But according to the sample output, it's CLOSED. This indicates a discrepancy.

Thus, the code's initial approach is correct, and the sample's explanation is wrong.

But the sample's output is CORRECT with the first query being OPEN, the second CLOSED, third UNKNOWN.

Wait, sample input's closed entry is 9,9,9. Code's initial approach would not consider it as invalid. Thus, the data is valid.

For the second query, 10,10,10:

x=10 is in [1,10] (xmax=10), y=10 in [1,10], z=10 in [1,10]. So code's logic would output UNKNOWN, but sample output says CLOSED.

This suggests that the code is wrong.

Thus, there must be an error in the code's logic.

But why does the sample output say CLOSED for the query 10,10,10?

The sample explanation says:

The store is closed at 9,9,9. So the store's schedule must have xr <9. Because if xr >=9, then x=9 is in the x ranges. So the store's xr must be <=8. So xr can be between 6 (x_max) and 8. Thus, for the query x=10, which is >xr (<=8), the query is excluded. Thus, it's CLOSED.

But how does the code capture this?

The code's current logic does not consider this scenario. Because the code assumes that xr can be up to xmax=10, which would include x=10.

Thus, the code's logic is incorrect.

Thus, the correct approach must take into account the constraints imposed by the closed entries.

Thus, the code's initial approach is incorrect. The correct approach is to not only check if closed entries are in the minimal ranges but also to compute the possible ranges that exclude all closed entries.

This seems like a problem that requires, for each coordinate, finding the possible ranges that exclude all closed entries.

But with large input sizes (up to 1e5), it's not feasible to compute this for each coordinate.

Thus, I need to find a different approach.

Alternative approach:

The store's ranges must include all open entries and exclude all closed entries.

For x, the possible xl is <=x_min, xr >=x_max.

For the closed entries, we must have for each closed entry, x <xl or x> xr or y <yl or y> yr or z <zl or z> zr.

Thus, the ranges xl, xr, yl, yr, zl, zr must be chosen such that:

For each closed entry (x, y, z):

Either x <xl (but xl <=x_min, and x can be <=x_max).

Or x> xr (xr >=x_max).

Or similarly for y or z.

But this is a complex problem.

An alternative way is to compute the minimal possible xr and maximal possible xl that allows all closed entries to be excluded.

But this seems difficult.

For xr:

The maximum xr can be xmax. But to exclude a closed entry with x >x_max and <=xmax, xr must be <x.

Thus, the xr must be less than the minimal x among closed entries where x >x_max.

But if there are closed entries with x >x_max, then xr must be <=min_x_closed_entries_x_greater_than_x_max.

Wait, no. For closed entries where x >x_max, to exclude them, xr must be <x. So for all such closed entries, xr must be <x. So the maximum xr can be is the minimal x of such entries minus 1.

If there are no such closed entries, then xr can be up to xmax.

Thus, xr is bounded by:

xr >=x_max

xr < min_closed_x_above_x_max (if any)

So if there are closed entries with x >x_max, then xr must be < the minimal x of those entries.

Similarly for xl: xl must be > maximal x of closed entries where x <x_min.

Thus, the approach is:

For x:

- xr must be >=x_max.

- If any closed entry has x >x_max, xr must be < the minimal x among them.

Thus, xr_max = min( min_closed_x_above_x_max -1, xmax )

If there are no closed entries with x >x_max, xr_max =xmax.

Thus, xr can be between x_max and xr_max.

Similarly, xl must be <=x_min.

- If any closed entry has x <x_min, xl must be > the maximal x among them.

Thus, xl_min = max( max_closed_x_below_x_min +1, 1 )

If there are no closed entries with x <x_min, xl_min =1.

xl can be between xl_min and x_min.

Thus, the possible x ranges are xl in [xl_min, x_min] and xr in [x_max, xr_max].

If xl_min >x_min or xr_max <x_max → no solution.

Similarly for y and z.

Thus, the code must compute for each coordinate:

xl_min: the maximal x among closed entries where x <x_min, plus 1. If no such entries, 1.

xr_max: the minimal x among closed entries where x >x_max, minus 1. If no such entries, xmax.

Then, the possible xl must be <=x_min and >=xl_min.

Possible xr must be >=x_max and <=xr_max.

If xl_min >x_min → no solution.

If xr_max <x_max → no solution.

Similarly for y and z.

Thus, the code should compute:

For x:

closed_x_less_min = list of closed entries' x where x <x_min.

closed_x_greater_max = list of closed entries' x where x >x_max.

xl_min = max( (max(closed_x_less_min) +1) if closed_x_less_min else 1, 1 )

xr_max = min( (min(closed_x_greater_max) -1) if closed_x_greater_max else xmax, xmax )

if xl_min >x_min or xr_max <x_max → invalid.

Similarly for y and z.

If any of the coordinates is invalid → output INCORRECT.

Else, compute possible ranges for x, y, z.

Then, for each query (x, y, z):

Check if x is in [xl_min, x_min] and [x_max, xr_max] → x is included in all possible x ranges.

Wait, no. x is in x ranges if x >=xl and x <=xr. xl can be from xl_min to x_min, xr from x_max to xr_max.

Thus, the minimal xl is xl_min, maximal xl is x_min.

The minimal xr is x_max, maximal xr is xr_max.

Thus, for a query's x to be in all possible x ranges:

x must be >=xl_min and <=x_max.

Because for any xl in [xl_min, x_min], x >=xl. And x <=xr for any xr >=x_max.

Wait, no.

Wait, xr is >=x_max, so x <=xr is true for any x <=xr_max. But x can be larger than x_max.

For example, x_max=6, xr_max=10. x=7 is <=xr_max=10, but depends on xr. So x=7 can be in x ranges if xr >=7. But if xr is 6 (x_max=6), then x=7 is excluded.

Thus, for a query's x to be in all possible x ranges, it must be <=x_max and >=xl_min.

Because if x >=xl_min and <=x_max:

- x >=xl (since xl <=x_min <=x_max and xl >=xl_min).

- x <=xr (since xr >=x_max >=x).

Thus, for x in [xl_min, x_max], it is included in all possible x ranges.

For x <xl_min: possible xl is >=xl_min. So x <xl → excluded.

For x >x_max and <=xr_max: x can be included if xr is >=x. But xr can be as low as x_max. So x can be included or excluded.

Thus, for a query to be OPEN, it must be in [xl_min, x_max] for x, [yl_min, y_max] for y, [zl_min, z_max] for z.

For a query to be CLOSED, it must be excluded from all possible ranges. Which means:

x <xl_min OR x> xr_max OR y <yl_min OR y> yr_max OR z <zl_min OR z> zr_max.

Otherwise, it's UNKNOWN.

Thus, the code must compute xl_min, xr_max for each coordinate, and then for each query, check:

- If x is in [xl_min, x_max], y in [yl_min, y_max], z in [zl_min, z_max] → OPEN.

- Else if x <xl_min OR x> xr_max OR y <yl_min OR y> yr_max OR z <zl_min OR z> zr_max → CLOSED.

- Else → UNKNOWN.

Thus, the code's logic must be adjusted to compute xl_min, xr_max, etc.

But how to compute these values.

Let's outline the steps:

For x:

1. Collect all closed entries where x <x_min. Find the maximum x among them. xl_min is max_x_in_closed_less_x_min +1. If none, xl_min=1.

2. Collect all closed entries where x >x_max. Find the minimum x among them. xr_max is min_x_in_closed_greater_x_max -1. If none, xr_max=xmax.

3. Check if xl_min >x_min → invalid.

4. Check if xr_max <x_max → invalid.

Repeat for y and z.

If any of the coordinates is invalid, output INCORRECT.

Else, for each query:

Check if x is between xl_min and x_max, y between yl_min and y_max, z between zl_min and z_max → OPEN.

Else if x <xl_min OR x> xr_max OR y <yl_min OR y> yr_max OR z <zl_min OR z> zr_max → CLOSED.

Else → UNKNOWN.

Thus, this approach correctly handles the sample input.

Let's apply it to the first sample.

First sample:

xmax=10, ymax=10, zmax=10.

Open entries:

x: 2,4,6 → x_min=2, x_max=6.

Closed entries: 9,9,9.

For x:

Closed entries where x <x_min (2): none → xl_min=1.

Closed entries where x >x_max (6): x=9. The minimum is 9 → xr_max=9-1=8.

Check if xl_min <=x_min → 1 <=2 → ok.

xr_max >=x_max → 8 >=6 → ok.

Thus, x ranges are xl between 1 and 2, xr between 6 and 8.

For y:

Closed entries where y <y_min (2): none → yl_min=1.

Closed entries where y> y_max (6): none → yr_max=ymax=10.

Thus, y ranges are yl between 1 and 2, yr between 6 and 10.

For z:

Closed entries where z <z_min (2): none → zl_min=1.

Closed entries where z> z_max (6): none → zr_max=10.

Thus, z ranges are zl between 1 and 2, zr between 6 and 10.

Thus, for the query 10,10,10:

x=10 >xr_max=8 → CLOSED.

Thus, the code's output would be CLOSED, which matches the sample.

Thus, this approach is correct.

Thus, the code must be modified to compute xl_min, xr_max, yl_min, yr_max, zl_min, zr_max, and check their validity.

Thus, the code steps are:

Read the open entries, compute x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max.

For each coordinate (x, y, z):

- Find the maximum value in closed entries where the coordinate is < the open's min. For x, this is max_closed_x_less_min.

   xl_min = max_closed_x_less_min +1 if any, else 1.

- Find the minimum value in closed entries where the coordinate is > the open's max. For x, this is min_closed_x_greater_max.

   xr_max = min_closed_x_greater_max -1 if any, else xmax.

- Check if xl_min > x_min → invalid.

- Check if xr_max <x_max → invalid.

Repeat for y and z.

If any of the coordinates is invalid → output INCORRECT.

Else, for queries:

For each query (x, y, z):

- If x is between xl_min and x_max, y between yl_min and y_max, z between zl_min and z_max → OPEN.

- Else if x <xl_min or x> xr_max or y <yl_min or y> yr_max or z <zl_min or z> zr_max → CLOSED.

- Else → UNKNOWN.

Thus, this is the correct approach.

Now, the code must be implemented accordingly.

Now, let's implement this.

In Python:

Read the closed entries and compute for each coordinate:

For x:

closed_x_less_min = list of x in closed entries where x <x_min.

closed_x_greater_max = list of x in closed entries where x >x_max.

xl_min = max(closed_x_less_min) +1 if closed_x_less_min else 1.

xr_max = min(closed_x_greater_max) -1 if closed_x_greater_max else xmax.

Check if xl_min >x_min → invalid.

Check if xr_max <x_max → invalid.

Do the same for y and z.

Thus, code:

Read data.

Compute x_min, x_max, y_min, y_max, z_min, z_max.

Process all closed entries:

collect for x:

closed_x_less_min = list of x where x <x_min.

closed_x_greater_max = list of x where x >x_max.

Similarly for y and z.

Compute xl_min:

if closed_x_less_min is not empty:

   xl_min = max(closed_x_less_min) +1

else:

   xl_min = 1

xr_max:

if closed_x_greater_max not empty:

   xr_max = min(closed_x_greater_max) -1

else:

   xr_max = xmax

Check if xl_min >x_min → invalid.

Check if xr_max <x_max → invalid.

Repeat for y and z.

If any invalid → output INCORRECT.

Else, for queries:

Check:

OPEN if x is in [xl_min, x_max], y in [yl_min, y_max], z in [zl_min, z_max].

CLOSED if x <xl_min or x> xr_max or y <yl_min or y> yr_max or z <zl_min or z> zr_max.

Else UNKNOWN.

Thus, the code is:

        print("CLOSED")
    else:
        print("UNKNOWN")

Let's test this code with the first sample input.

Sample input 1:

10 10 10 3 1 3

Open entries: x=2,4,6 → x_min=2, x_max=6.

Closed entry:9,9,9.

For x:

closed_x_less_min: empty → xl_min=1.

closed_x_greater_max: x=9 → min is 9. xr_max=9-1=8.

Check xl_min <=x_min (1<=2) → ok.

xr_max >=x_max (8 >=6) → ok.

For y:

closed_y_less_min: none → yl_min=1.

closed_y_greater_max: y=9>6 → min is9 → yr_max=9-1=8.

Check yl_min <=y_min (1<=2) → ok.

yr_max >=y_max (8 >=6) → ok.

For z:

closed_z_greater_max: z=9>6 → min is9-1=8.

Check zl_min=1, zr_max=8 >=6 → ok.

Thus, all coordinates are valid.

Queries:

1. 3,3,3 → x=3 is between 1 and 6 (xl_min=1, x_max=6). y=3 between 1 and 6 (yl_min=1, y_max=6). z=3 between 1 and 6 → OPEN.

2. 10,10,10 → x=10> xr_max=8 → CLOSED.

3. 8,8,8 → x=8 between x_max=6 and xr_max=8. But x_max=6 <8 → x is not in [xl_min=1, x_max=6]. So not OPEN. Also, x=8 is <=xr_max=8. So not CLOSED. Thus, UNKNOWN.

Which matches the sample output.

The second sample input:

10 10 10 1 1 1

Open entry: 2 5 7 → x_min=2, x_max=2. y_min=5, y_max=5. z_min=7, z_max=7.

Closed entry:2 5 7 → x=2 is between x_min and x_max (2-2). y=5 between 5-5. z=7 between 7-7. Thus, the closed entry is in the minimal ranges. Thus, the code would compute:

closed_x_less_min: none.

closed_x_greater_max: none.

xl_min=1.

xr_max=10.

Check xl_min <=x_min (1<=2) → ok.

xr_max >=x_max (10>=2) → ok.

For y:

closed_y_less_min: y=5 <5 → no.

closed_y_greater_max: y=5>5 → no.

yl_min=1.

yr_max=10.

Check yl_min <=5, yr_max >=5 → ok.

For z:

closed_z_less_min: z=7<7 → no.

closed_z_greater_max: z=7>7 → no.

zl_min=1.

zr_max=10.

Check ok.

But the closed entry is 2,5,7 → which is in the minimal ranges. Thus, the code would check if x <xl_min (2 >=1 → no), x> xr_max (2 <=10 → no), etc. But the closed entry is in all ranges. Thus, code's initial approach would catch this closed entry as being in the minimal ranges, and output INCORRECT.

But according to the code's new approach:

closed_x_less_min for x=2: x >=x_min=2 → not added.

closed_x_greater_max: x=2 <=x_max=2 → not added.

Thus, closed_x_less_min and closed_x_greater_max are empty.

xl_min=1.

xr_max=10.

For x, no problem.

Similarly for y and z.

Thus, the code would proceed to check the closed entry. But the code in the new approach doesn't check if the closed entry is in the minimal ranges.

But according to the new approach, the code checks if the closed entry is excluded by the ranges computed.

But in this case, the closed entry is in the computed ranges:

x=2 is between xl_min=1 and x_max=2.

y=5 is between yl_min=1 and y_max=5.

z=7 is between zl_min=1 and z_max=7.

Thus, the code's computed ranges include the closed entry. Thus, the data is inconsistent. But according to the code's new approach, this is allowed.

But according to the sample input, this case is INCORRECT.

Thus, the new approach is also incorrect.

Ah, here's the problem. The new approach only checks if the closed entries are excluded by the computed ranges (xl_min, xr_max, etc.), but the actual ranges can vary within those constraints. Thus, the code's new approach is incorrect.

In the second sample input, the closed entry is part of the open entries. Thus, the data is inconsistent. But according to the new approach, the code computes xl_min=1, xr_max=10. Thus, the closed entry is included in the ranges [1, 10], [1,10], [1,10], which includes the closed entry, leading to inconsistency.

Thus, the code's new approach is also wrong.

Thus, the correct approach must also check if any closed entry is in all possible ranges.

But how?

The problem is that the new approach computes the ranges xl_min, xr_max, etc., but these ranges are the most permissive that can exclude all closed entries. If a closed entry is not excluded by these ranges, then it's impossible to find any ranges that exclude it.

Thus, after computing xl_min and xr_max, the code must check if all closed entries are excluded by the ranges [xl_min, xr_max] (for x), etc.

But wait, no. Because the ranges [xl_min, xr_max] are the most permissive possible. If a closed entry is excluded by these ranges, then it's excluded by all possible ranges. If a closed entry is not excluded by these ranges, then there exists some ranges that include it.

Thus, the code must check that for each closed entry, it is excluded by at least one of the computed ranges (xl_min, xr_max, etc.).

Thus, after computing xl_min, xr_max, yl_min, yr_max, zl_min, zr_max, the code must check that for each closed entry, at least one of the following is true:

x < xl_min OR x >xr_max OR y <yl_min OR y> yr_max OR z <zl_min OR z> zr_max.

If this is not the case for any closed entry, then the data is invalid.

Thus, the code must add this check.

Thus, the steps are:

After computing xl_min, xr_max, yl_min, yr_max, zl_min, zr_max, we must check that for each closed entry (x, y, z), at least one of the following is true:

x <xl_min OR x> xr_max OR y <yl_min OR y> yr_max OR z <zl_min OR z> zr_max.

If any closed entry does not satisfy this, the data is invalid.

Thus, the code must process all closed entries again and check this condition.

Thus, the code must:

For each closed entry (x, y, z):

if not (x <xl_min or x >xr_max or y <yl_min or y> yr_max or z <zl_min or z> zr_max):

   data is invalid.

Thus, the code must read all closed entries again (or store them) and perform this check.

This is necessary because the code must ensure that all closed entries are excluded by the computed ranges.

Thus, the code must store all closed entries and after computing the ranges, check each closed entry against the ranges.

Thus, the code must be adjusted to store all closed entries.

Thus, code steps:

Read all closed entries into a list.

Compute xl_min, xr_max, etc.

Check for each closed entry:

if x >=xl_min and x <=xr_max and y >=yl_min and y <=yr_max and z >=zl_min and z <=zr_max → data invalid.

Thus, the code must:

After computing the ranges:

for x_closed, y_closed, z_closed in closed_entries:

   if (xl_min <= x_closed <= xr_max) and (yl_min <= y_closed <= yr_max) and (zl_min <= z_closed <= zr_max):

       print("INCORRECT")

       exit()

Thus, this additional check is needed.

Thus, the code's final steps are:

import sys

data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))
ptr = 0

xmax = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
ymax = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
zmax = data[ptr]; ptr +=1
n = data[ptr]; ptr +=1

Now, let's test this code on the second sample input:

Sample input 2:

10 10 10 1 1 1

Open entry: 2 5 7 → x_min=2, x_max=2; y_min=5, y_max=5; z_min=7, z_max=7.

Closed entry:2 5 7.

For x:

closed_x_less_min: none.

closed_x_greater_max: none.

xl_min=1, xr_max=10.

Check xl_min <=2 and xr_max >=2 → ok.

For y:

closed_y_less_min: none.

closed_y_greater_max: none.

yl_min=1, yr_max=10.

Check ok.

For z:

closed_z_less_min: none.

closed_z_greater_max: none.

zl_min=1, zr_max=10.

Check ok.

Then, check all closed entries against the computed ranges:

For closed entry (2,5,7):

x=2 is between 1 and 10.

y=5 between 1 and10.

z=7 between 1 and10.

Thus, the code checks if (1<=2<=10) and (1<=5<=10) and (1<=7<=10) → yes. Thus, data is inconsistent → output INCORRECT.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, this code should work correctly.
