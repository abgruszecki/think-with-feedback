Okay, let's tackle this problem. The goal is to compute the error function F for each potential address compared to the user's input address. Hmm. Let me understand the problem step by step.

So, for each character in the potential address c, we need to find the closest occurrence in the user's address s. The absolute difference between their positions is added to F. If the character isn't present in s at all, add the length of c to F.

The main challenge here is efficiently finding, for each character in c, the minimal |i-j| where j is the position in s of the same character. And since there are up to 1e5 potential addresses, each possibly being up to 2e5 total characters, we need an efficient way to process this.

First, let's think about preprocessing the user's string s. For each character in s, we can store a list of all the indices where it occurs. Then, for a given character in c, we can perform a binary search on this list to find the closest position to the current index in c.

Yes, that makes sense. For example, if the user's string is 'codeforces', and the potential character is 'c', then for each occurrence of 'c' in c, we look up the positions of 'c' in s and find the nearest one.

So, the steps would be:

1. Preprocess the user's string s into a dictionary where each key is a character, and the value is a sorted list of indices (1-based?) where the character occurs. Wait, the problem mentions positions, but the input could be 1-based or 0-based? The problem statement says, "for every i (1 ≤ i ≤ |c|)" so the positions are 1-based. So the indices in s and c are 1-based.

Wait, the sample input:

In the first example, the user's address is 'codeforces' which is 10 characters. The first potential address is the same, so the error is 0. The second is 'codehorses', which has 'h' at position 5 (since the code is 'codehorses'). Let's see:

For each character in 'codehorses', compare to 'codeforces'.

Let's take the 'h' in 'codehorses' at position 5. We need to find the closest occurrence of 'h' in 'codeforces'. But 'codeforces' doesn't have 'h', so the error added is the length of 'codehorses' which is 10. But in the sample output, the second output is 12. Wait, that sample's second output is 12. So maybe the codehorses is length 10. Let's see:

codeforces is 10 letters. codehorses is also 10 letters. So for each character in codehorses:

c: position 1 in c. In s, c is at position 1. So |1-1|=0. O, but let's see each character:

Wait codehorses is 'c o d e h o r s e s' (length 10). The user's input is 'c o d e f o r c e s' (length 10). So for each character in codehorses:

Let's go through each position:

1. c: in s, positions are 1, 8. So the closest to 1 is 1. So 0.

2. o: in s, o is at positions 2,6. Current position in codehorses is 2. The closest is 2 (since 2-2=0). So 0.

3. d: in s, position 3. So 3 vs 3: 0.

4. e: in s, positions 4,9. Current position 4. So 4-4=0.

5. h: not present in s. So add 10.

6. o: in s, positions 2 and 6. Current position 6. Closest is 6. So 0.

7. r: in s, position 7. Current position 7: 0.

8. s: in s, position 10. Current position 8: 10-8=2.

9. e: in s, positions 4 and 9. Current position 9: closest is 9. So 0.

10. s: in s, position 10. Current position 10: 0.

So sum is 10 (from h) + 2 (s at 8) = 12. Which matches the sample output. So yes, the codehorses adds 12.

So the approach is correct.

Now, the problem is to process each character in the potential address. For each character in c (the potential address), we need to find the closest occurrence in s. If there are none, add |c| (the length of c) to F. Wait, no: if the character in c isn't present in s, then the error added for that character is |c|. Wait, the problem statement says: if no such ci exists in s, then add |c|. So for each character in c, if s doesn't have that character, then add |c| to F. So, for each character in the potential address, check if it exists in s. If not, add the length of the potential address (current c's length) to F. Otherwise, find the minimal |i-j| and add that.

So, for each potential address c_i, we need to process each character in c_i (each position in c_i, 1-based). For each character at position i in c_i, if the character is not present in s, add len(c_i) to F. Otherwise, find the closest position j in s where the character is found, and add |i-j|.

So, the steps for each potential address:

1. Get the string c (current potential address).

2. For each character in c, at position i (starting from 1):

   a. Check if the character is in s's preprocessed dictionary.

   b. If not, add len(c) to F.

   c. Else, find the closest j in s's positions for that character, and add |i-j|.

So the key is, for each character in c, to quickly find the closest j in the list of positions stored in the dictionary.

Now, the main challenge is to process each character in O(log m) time, where m is the number of occurrences in s of that character.

How to preprocess s:

For each character in s, create a list of indices (1-based) where it appears. Then, for each occurrence of a character in c, look up this list and perform a binary search to find the insertion point. The closest would be either the element before or after the insertion point.

So, for example, if the list is [1,3,5], and the current i is 4, the insertion point is 2 (since 3 <4 <5). So the closest is 3 or 5. The minimal difference is min(4-3,5-4) =1.

So the approach is:

For a given i, find the position in the sorted list where i would be inserted. Then compare the elements before and after that position (if they exist) and take the minimum.

So for each character in c, and for each i in c's position, we can perform a binary search on the sorted list of that character's positions in s. This is O(log m) per character, where m is the number of occurrences of the character in s.

Now, considering that the total sum of all potential addresses' lengths is up to 2e5, and each per-character processing is O(log m), which is acceptable.

So the plan is:

- Preprocess s into a dictionary mapping characters to their sorted list of indices.

- For each potential address c:

   a. Compute len_c = len(c).

   b. Initialize F to 0.

   c. For each i (1-based) in c:

      i. Get the character ch = c[i-1] (since Python strings are 0-based).

      ii. If ch not in the dictionary, add len_c to F.

      iii. Else, get the list of positions in s for ch. Use bisect to find the insertion point of i in this list.

      iv. Check the elements before and after the insertion point to find the minimal |i - j|. Add this to F.

   d. Output F.

Now, the key is to handle the binary search correctly. Let's think about the edge cases. For example, insertion point is 0 (all elements are larger than i), then the closest is the first element. If insertion point is at the end of the list (all elements are smaller), then the closest is the last element. Otherwise, compare the elements before and after the insertion point.

Python's bisect module can help here. For example, using bisect_left to find the insertion index.

So, code steps:

For each character ch in the current c's characters:

   if ch not in the s_dict:

       F += len_c

   else:

       positions = s_dict[ch]

       idx = bisect.bisect_left(positions, i)

       min_dist = infinity

       if idx < len(positions):

           min_dist = positions[idx] - i

       if idx >0:

           min_dist = min(min_dist, i - positions[idx-1])

       F += min_dist

Wait, but in Python, the bisect_left function returns the insertion point. For example, for a list [1,3,5], and i=4, bisect_left returns 2 (since 3 <4 <5). So the elements to check are positions[1] (3) and positions[2] (5). The distances are 4-3=1 and 5-4=1. So min is 1.

But in code, for idx = bisect.bisect_left(positions, i):

   if idx is 0: then there's no element before. The closest is positions[0], so distance is positions[0] - i.

   if idx is len(positions): the closest is positions[-1], distance is i - positions[-1].

   else: compare positions[idx-1] and positions[idx], take the min.

So code for that part would be:

from bisect import bisect_left

positions = s_dict[ch]

idx = bisect_left(positions, i)

min_dist = float('inf')

if idx < len(positions):

    min_dist = positions[idx] - i

if idx > 0:

    current = i - positions[idx-1]

    if current < min_dist:

        min_dist = current

F += min_dist

But since the positions are sorted, we can efficiently compute the minimum.

But wait, in code, i is the current position in the potential address (1-based). So, for example, in the code for the first sample, when processing the 'h' in codehorses which is not present in s, then len(c) is 10, and that's added to F.

So, now, the code structure is clear.

Now, considering the constraints:

n and k can be up to 1e5, and the total length of all potential addresses is up to 2e5. So the code needs to process each character of each potential address in O(log m), which is acceptable.

So the steps are:

1. Read n and k.

2. Read s (length k). Preprocess s into a dictionary, where each key is a character, and the value is a list of indices (1-based) where the character appears. For example, if s is 'codeforces', then for 'c', the list is [1,8].

3. Read n lines, each being a potential address. For each, compute F as per the problem statement.

Now, the problem is to process each potential address efficiently.

In Python, using the bisect module will be efficient enough for the given constraints. The per-test-case processing is O(m * log l), where m is the length of the potential address, and l is the number of occurrences in s of the character. Since the total sum of m across all test cases is 2e5, and each log l is up to log(1e5) which is around 17, the total operations are 2e5 * 17 = 3.4e6, which is acceptable for Python's time constraints.

Now, the code:

First, build the s_dict. For example:

s = input().strip()

s_dict = defaultdict(list)

for idx, ch in enumerate(s, start=1):

    s_dict[ch].append(idx)

Then, for each potential address:

for _ in range(n):

    c = input().strip()

    len_c = len(c)

    total = 0

    for i, ch in enumerate(c, start=1):

        if ch not in s_dict:

            total += len_c

        else:

            positions = s_dict[ch]

            idx = bisect.bisect_left(positions, i)

            min_dist = float('inf')

            if idx < len(positions):

                min_dist = positions[idx] - i

            if idx > 0:

                current = i - positions[idx-1]

                if current < min_dist:

                    min_dist = current

            total += min_dist

    print(total)

This should work. But wait, in the case where the character is present in s but the list is empty? No, because s is the user's address of length k. So each character in s is added to the s_dict with at least one position. So if the code checks 'ch in s_dict', then the list is non-empty.

Yes.

Now, testing the first sample:

Sample 1:

Input:

2 10

codeforces

codeforces

codehorses

The first potential address is codeforces. For each character in codeforces, the positions in s are exactly the same. So for each i, the closest j is i. So the total is 0.

The second potential address is codehorses. For each character:

The h is not present in s_dict (since s is codeforces, which has no h). So len(c) is 10, so adding 10 for the h. Then the s in codehorses at position 8: in s, the s is at position 10. So |8-10|=2. So total is 10+2=12. The rest of the characters have 0. So the output is 12.

Which matches the sample.

Another sample in the input:

The second sample's output is 18 for the first line. Let's see.

But regardless, the code should handle all cases.

Now, the possible optimizations:

In Python, using a list for each character in s_dict is already efficient. The bisect module is implemented in C, so the binary search is fast.

But what about the case where a potential address has a lot of characters not present in s? For example, if a potential address is 1e5 characters, none of which are in s, then for each character, we add len_c (1e5) to F. So for 1e5 characters, that's 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10, which is way beyond the 64-bit integer range. Wait, but Python handles big integers, but the problem says to output the number. But according to the output examples, the numbers can be up to 84 (like the last case in the second sample). Wait, but in the first sample, adding 10 once and 2 once gives 12. But if the potential address is 1e5 characters long and none are in s, then the F would be 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10, which is a 32-bit integer overflow, but Python can handle that.

So no problem here.

Now, code in Python:

Implementing all of this.

But wait, in Python, the code for reading the input. The first line is n and k.

Then the next line is s (length k). Then n lines of potential addresses.

But the code must read s correctly. So:

import bisect

from collections import defaultdict

n, k = map(int, input().split())

s = input().strip()

s_dict = defaultdict(list)

for idx, ch in enumerate(s, 1):

    s_dict[ch].append(idx)

for _ in range(n):

    c = input().strip()

    len_c = len(c)

    total = 0

    for i, ch in enumerate(c, 1):

        if ch not in s_dict:

            total += len_c

        else:

            positions = s_dict[ch]

            idx = bisect.bisect_left(positions, i)

            min_dist = float('inf')

            # Check if idx is within the list

            if idx < len(positions):

                min_dist = positions[idx] - i

            # Check previous index

            if idx > 0:

                current = i - positions[idx-1]

                if current < min_dist:

                    min_dist = current

            total += min_dist

    print(total)

This should be the code.

Testing the first sample:

Input:

2 10

codeforces

codeforces

codehorses

Processing the first potential address, 'codeforces':

Each character is present in s_dict.

For each position i in 1-10:

In codeforces, s_dict for each character:

For 'c', positions are [1, 8]. So for i=1: bisect_left finds index 0. So check positions[0] (1) and nothing before. So min_dist is 0. Same for all other characters.

So the sum is 0.

The second address, 'codehorses':

The 'h' is not in s_dict, so adds 10.

The 's' in position 8: in s_dict['s'], positions are [10]. So i=8, bisect_left returns 0. So check positions[0] (10). min_dist is 2. So total is 10+2=12.

Other characters are handled properly.

So the code works.

Now, considering the constraints. The code should run within 2 seconds. For 2e5 characters, each with a binary search, in Python, it's tight but manageable. The code uses the fastest possible methods, like using the bisect module and defaultdict, which should be efficient.

But in Python, using enumerate is efficient. The code does not have any unnecessary steps. So this should be the optimal solution.
