<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about counting the number of ways to replace 0s in a sequence with 2 or 4 such that when the sequence is processed according to the game rules, at least one tile reaches a value of at least 2^k. The constraints are n up to 2000, and k up to 11. So we need an efficient way to model the game process for each possible sequence and track whether any tile meets the condition.

First, let's understand the game mechanics. When a new number (2 or 4) is added, it starts moving to the beginning of the stripe. While moving, if the next square is the same, they merge into double and continue moving. Otherwise, it stops. So each new number triggers a merging process that might affect the existing tiles.

The key here is that for each step in the sequence, we need to track the state of the stripe after each addition. The state consists of the current tiles and their positions, but since the stripe is processed in a way that numbers are merged as they move left, the state after each step can be represented as a list of numbers in order from left to right, where each consecutive number is different. Because once a number is added, it merges as much as possible towards the left. So after each step, the stripe is a list of numbers where each next number is different from the previous. For example, after adding a number, it's processed into the stripe, possibly merging with existing numbers.

So the state after processing each element in the sequence is a list of numbers. But tracking all possible states directly could be expensive. However, given that k is up to 11, 2^k is 2048, but the maximum possible value we need to check is 2^k, which for k=11 is 2048. Wait, no, the problem states that the sequence is winning if any square has a number >= 2^k. So for k=11, that's 2048. But the actual maximum possible tile could be higher, but we only need to check if any is >= 2^k.

But how do we model the state transitions efficiently? Let's think about the possible states. Each state is a list of numbers in order, such that consecutive numbers are different. Also, for the purpose of the problem, once a tile reaches 2^k or higher, the sequence is considered winning. So once a state has such a tile, all subsequent steps can be considered as winning, and we don't need to track further changes. Therefore, our dynamic programming approach can track the current state of the stripe and a flag indicating whether a winning tile has been achieved so far.

But the problem is that the stripe can have arbitrary length. However, since each new number can only merge with existing numbers to the left, perhaps the stripe's length is limited. For example, after each step, the stripe's length can't exceed some value. Let's think: each new number can merge once, maybe. For instance, if the current stripe is [8,4], adding a 4 would result in the new 4 moving left. It would check the next square (4), which is same, so merge into 8, then continue. Then the next square is 8, same as the merged 8, so merge again into 16. So the stripe becomes [16]. So each addition can cause multiple merges.

But the maximum possible tile value is 2^m, but since we only care about whether any tile is >= 2^k, once a tile reaches that, we can mark the sequence as winning. So in the DP state, once the winning flag is True, we can ignore the rest of the steps, as the sequence is already counted as a win.

Therefore, the DP state can be represented as:

- The current list of tiles (each consecutive being different)
- A flag indicating if any tile is >= 2^k.

But maintaining the entire list for each state is impractical for n=2000. So we need a way to represent the state in a compressed form that allows transitions efficiently.

Wait, but what's the maximum possible length of the stripe after processing n steps? Let's think. Each step adds a new number (2 or 4). Each merge can reduce the length. For example, adding a 2 to a stripe where the leftmost tile is 2 would merge into 4, reducing the length. However, in other cases, adding a number may not merge. For example, if the current stripe is [4, 2], adding a 2 will merge with the 2 (since as the new 2 moves left, the next tile is 2. Wait, no. When a new number is added, it starts moving towards the beginning. So the process is:

Let me think through the example in the first note:

Sample 1:

7 4

Sequence: 2 2 4 2 2 2 2.

After each step, the stripe becomes:

First 2: [2]

Second 2: when added, it moves left. Since the first tile is 2, they merge into 4. So [4]

Third 4: added. The current stripe is [4]. The new 4 moves left. The next tile is 4, so they merge into 8. Now, the 8 continues moving. Since it's the first tile, it stops. So [8].

Fourth 2: added. It moves left. The next tile is 8 (different), so stops. Stripe becomes [8,2].

Fifth 2: added. Moves left. Next is 8 (different), so stops. Stripe [8,2,2]. Wait, but when the 2 is added, it moves left. Let me recheck.

Wait, when a new number is added, it starts moving towards the beginning (left). So when you add a number, the initial position is the end of the stripe. Then it moves left, merging as per the rules.

For example, after the fourth step in sample 1, when adding a 2:

The current stripe is [8]. The new 2 is placed at the end (position after 8). Then it moves left. The next square is 8, which is different. So the 2 stops. Stripe becomes [8,2].

Fifth step is adding another 2. The new 2 is placed at the end (after the 2). Then it moves left. The next square is 2, same as x=2, so they merge into 4. The 4 continues moving left. The next square is 8, which is different. So the 4 stops. Stripe becomes [8,4].

So the process for each new number is:

Start at the end (rightmost position), then move left as far as possible, merging same numbers.

So the key is that each new number can cause a chain of merges as it moves left.

But the resulting state after processing a number is a list of numbers where consecutive elements are different. Because whenever same numbers are adjacent during the merge process, they merge into one, and then continue moving.

Therefore, the state after each step is a list of numbers where each consecutive pair is different.

Now, for the DP approach, the state can be represented by this list and the flag indicating if any number in the list is >= 2^k. But since the list can vary in length, how can we represent it efficiently?

Another observation: the maximum possible value in the list is 2^m. Since k can be up to 11, 2^k is 2048. But once a tile reaches 2^k or higher, the flag is set, and we don't need to track the state beyond that. So any state where the flag is True can be considered as "winning" and the remaining steps can be multiplied by 2^number_of_zeros_left, since those choices don't affect the outcome.

Therefore, the DP state can be:

- The current list of numbers (without consecutive duplicates)
- Whether the list has a number >= 2^k.

Additionally, for efficiency, we can represent the list as a tuple of numbers (since tuples are hashable) and track the state transitions. However, even with this, the number of possible states could be large. For example, each element in the list can be 2^m (m up to 11 or higher), but perhaps with the constraints of consecutive elements being different, and the list length being limited.

But n is up to 2000. So for each of the 2000 steps, the number of possible states must be manageable. Let's think about the possible list lengths.

Each time a new number is added, the list can grow by one (if the new number doesn't merge) or decrease (if merging occurs). For example, adding a 2 to a list ending with 2 will merge, leading to a new list that may be shorter. So the maximum possible length of the list after processing n steps could be up to n, but perhaps in practice it's much smaller. For instance, if all new numbers are 2 and they merge into a single tile each time, the length could be 1. But with varying numbers, the length could grow.

But considering that for each step, the number of possible states is manageable, especially since once a tile reaches the target, we can stop tracking the list and just track the count for the winning sequences.

So, the plan is to model the DP with states (current_list, has_win). For each step, for each possible state, and for each possible choice of 2 or 4 (if the current element is 0), we compute the next state after adding the number and merging.

But the problem is that for n=2000, and possible states per step, this could be O(n * S), where S is the number of possible states. If S is manageable, like up to 1e5, then for 2000 steps, it's 2e8 operations, which might be tight but perhaps manageable with optimizations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to represent the list in a compressed form. Let's see.

Let's look at the process of adding a number:

Suppose the current list is [a1, a2, ..., am], where a1 != a2, a2 != a3, etc. When adding a new number x (2 or 4), the new number starts at the end (rightmost position), and then moves left, merging as possible.

The merging process can be modeled as follows:

Start with x. Then, while the previous element (if any) is equal to x:

- Merge the two into x*2.
- x becomes x*2, and the previous element is removed.
- Continue moving left (if possible).

Wait, no. Let me re-express the merging rules correctly.

When the new x is added, it moves left step by step. At each step, if the next square (to the left) is the same as x, they merge into x*2, and then this new x*2 continues moving left. Otherwise, it stops.

Wait, no. The movement stops when:

- It is the first square (leftmost), or

- The next square to the left is a different number.

But during the movement, each time x can merge with the next square if they are the same. So the process is:

After adding x, it starts moving left. At each position, check the left neighbor.

For example:

Initial list: [a, b, c], where a != b, b != c.

Add x. New list (temporarily) is [a, b, c, x]. Then x starts moving left.

Check if the left neighbor (c) is equal to x. If yes, merge into x*2, and then this new x*2 moves left. So the list becomes [a, b, x*2], and x becomes x*2, which continues moving.

Check again: the left neighbor of x*2 is b. If b != x*2, then stop. So the final list is [a, b, x*2].

But if after merging, the new x*2's left neighbor is equal to x*2, then merge again.

So the merging is done in a loop until the next square is different or there's no next square.

So the process is:

current = x

position = len(list)

while position > 0:

    next_pos = position -1

    if list[next_pos] == current:

        list.pop(next_pos)

        current *= 2

        position = next_pos

    else:

        break

Then, insert current at position.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, the merging process can be thought of as:

Start with the new x. Then, while possible, merge with the left neighbor.

But each merge reduces the length of the list by 1 (since two elements are replaced by their sum).

Let's model this process.

For example:

Current list is [8, 4, 2], and we add a 2.

The new x is 2. It starts moving left.

Left neighbor is 2 (same as x). Merge into 4. Now, the new x is 4. Continue moving left.

Left neighbor is 4 (same as x). Merge into 8. Now, new x is 8. Continue moving.

Left neighbor is 8. Same as x. Merge into 16. Now, the list is [16].

So the merging process can merge multiple times.

So, the algorithm for processing a new x is:

Initialize current value as x.

Start at the end of the list (since x is added to the end).

Loop:

Check the previous element (if any).

If the previous element is equal to current value:

- Remove the previous element.

- current *= 2.

- Repeat the check with the new previous element (since the list is now shorter by one).

Else:

- Insert current at the current position (which is now the position after the previous element) and break.

Wait, but the list is built from left to right, so the new x is added to the end. So when x starts moving left, the elements are processed from right to left.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Start with the new x. The current position is the end of the list (after all existing elements).

2. While the current position is not the first element:

   a. Check the element to the left of the current position.

   b. If that element is equal to current x:

      i. Remove that element.

      ii. x *= 2.

      iii. The current position decreases by 1 (since the list is now shorter by one element).

   c. Else, break.

3. Insert x into the list at the current position.

Wait, but how to model the insertion. Let's take an example.

Original list: [a, b, c], where a != b, b != c.

Add x (say 2):

Start with x. The list is [a, b, c, x].

But in the movement, x is moving left.

Check the previous element (c). If c == x, merge. So remove c, x becomes 4. Now the list is [a, b, 4]. Then check the previous element (b). If 4 != b, insert 4 after b. So the list becomes [a, b, 4].

Wait, but in this scenario, the new x is 4, which is placed after b. But the original list after merging is [a, b] (since c and x merged into 4). Then, the new x (4) is added to the end, but since in the movement step, after merging, we need to check again.

Hmm, perhaps the merging process can be modeled as follows:

When adding a new x, the new x is processed as follows:

current = x

prev_pos = len(current_list) - 1 (i.e., the index of the last element in the current list, which is after the new x is added?)

Wait, perhaps the initial list is the current state. The new x is added to the end, but then merged as per movement rules.

But perhaps the way to model this is:

We have the current list L = [a1, a2, ..., am], where a1 != a2, a2 != a3, etc.

Add x to the end: new list is L' = L + [x]. Then process the x by moving left and merging as possible.

So during processing, x starts at position m (0-based index m in L'), and checks the previous element (m-1).

But since in L', the elements are a1, a2, ..., am, x.

Wait, no. The initial list L has elements a1, a2, ..., am. Adding x to the end gives a new list of length m+1, where the last element is x. Then, x starts moving left, checking the element to the left (position m-1 in the new list), which is am.

If am is equal to x, then merge: replace am and x with x*2. Then, this new x*2 (current) moves left again, checking the new previous element (a_{m-1}).

So, processing x in this way can be done by:

current = x

pos = len(L)  # position after the last element of L (since x is added to the end)

while True:

    if pos == 0:

        break  # can't move left anymore

    prev_pos = pos - 1

    prev_val = L[prev_pos]

    if prev_val == current:

        # merge

        current *= 2

        pos = prev_pos  # move to the left position

        L.pop(prev_pos)  # remove the previous element

    else:

        break  # can't merge, stop moving

# insert current into L at position pos

L.insert(pos, current)

Wait, but this approach may not work because L is modified during the process. Let's see.

Take the example where L is [4, 2, 2], and we add 2.

Wait, no, according to the problem statement, the initial list can't have consecutive duplicates. Because each step is processed such that consecutive elements are different. So, after processing each step, the list has no consecutive duplicates. Therefore, when adding a new x, the initial list has no consecutive duplicates, so when we add x, the new list (before processing) could have consecutive duplicates only at the end.

Wait, no. The list after processing a step is guaranteed to have no consecutive duplicates. So when adding a new x, it's added to the end (after processing any merging). So the initial list is always a list with no consecutive duplicates.

Wait, no. The initial list is the state after previous steps, which has no consecutive duplicates. Then, adding x to the end may create a list where the last two elements are the same (the previous last element and x). Then, the merging process is triggered.

So, for example, if the current list is [8,4], and we add 2. The new list before processing is [8,4,2], which has no consecutive duplicates. So no merging occurs. But if we add 4, the new list is [8,4,4]. Then, processing starts: the new x is 4, which starts at position 2 (third element). It checks the previous element (4 at position 1). They are equal, so merge into 8, remove the previous 4, and current becomes 8. Now, pos is 1. Check the previous element (8 at position 0). Equal to current 8. Merge into 16, remove 8. Now, pos is 0. Insert 16. So the final list is [16].

So the process for adding a new x can be modeled by:

current = x

pos = len(L)  # initial position after adding x (but x is not in L yet?)

Wait, perhaps the way to model this is:

The current list is L (without consecutive duplicates). When adding x, we simulate the merging process as follows:

We start by appending x to the list, creating a new temporary list L'. Then, we process the merging steps starting from the end.

But no, because after merging, the list is modified. So perhaps the correct approach is:

The list after adding x is not constructed by appending x first. Instead, the x is processed as a new element that moves left through the existing list, merging as possible.

Alternatively, the process is:

Start with the current list L. We want to add a new number x. Then:

- Start at the end of L (the position after the last element of L). The new x is moving left into L.

- current = x

- pos = len(L)  # initially, the new x is after the last element of L.

- Then, while pos > 0:

   check the element at pos - 1. If it's equal to current, merge, then current *= 2, pos decreases by 1, and remove the element at pos-1.

- After merging, insert current at pos.

Wait, but that's a bit abstract. Let's see with code.

For example, current list is [8,4], adding x=4.

Start with current=4, pos=2 (since len(L) is 2). So initial pos is 2.

Check pos-1 (1) which is 4. So equal to current. Merge: current becomes 8, pos becomes 1. Remove the element at pos-1 (1-1=0?), but wait:

Wait, maybe the code would look like this:

def process_add(L, x):

    current = x

    pos = len(L)

    while pos > 0:

        prev_pos = pos - 1

        if L[prev_pos] == current:

            current *= 2

            L.pop(prev_pos)

            pos = prev_pos

        else:

            break

    L.insert(pos, current)

    return L

But let's test this with some examples.

Test case 1: L = [4], x =4.

Processing:

current=4, pos=1.

prev_pos=0, L[0] is 4. So merge. current becomes 8. L becomes empty. pos becomes 0.

Loop again: pos is 0, loop condition (pos>0) is false. Insert 8 at pos 0. So L is [8].

Which is correct.

Another test case: L is [8,4], adding x=4.

process_add([8,4],4):

current =4, pos=2.

prev_pos=1. L[1] is 4. So merge to 8. L becomes [8]. pos becomes 1.

Loop again: pos>0 is true. prev_pos=0. L[0] is 8. current is 8. equal, so merge to 16. L becomes empty. pos becomes 0. Loop ends. insert 16 at 0. So L is [16].

Which is correct.

Another example: adding a 2 to [8,4,2]. The list is [8,4,2]. Adding 2. process_add([8,4,2], 2):

current=2, pos=3.

prev_pos=2. L[2] is 2. So merge into 4. L becomes [8,4]. pos becomes 2.

prev_pos=1: L[1] is 4. Not equal to 4 (current is 4). So insert at pos=2. So the new list is [8,4,4]. Then, the code would process again? Wait no. Wait, after inserting 4, the list becomes [8,4,4], but after processing, the code would have processed the merging. Wait, no. Because the function process_add is supposed to process the merging steps correctly. Let's see.

Wait, when the current list is [8,4,2], adding 2:

current =2, pos=3 (since len(L) is 3).

prev_pos=2: L[2] is 2. So merge, current becomes4, pos=2. L becomes [8,4].

prev_pos=1: L[1] is4. current is4. merge again. current becomes8, pos=1. L becomes [8].

prev_pos=0: L[0] is8. current is8. merge into 16. L becomes empty. pos=0.

insert 16 at pos 0. So list is [16].

Wait, but in the original list [8,4,2], adding 2 would result in:

new x=2. start moving left. merge with 2 (current becomes4). then merge with 4 (current becomes8). then merge with 8 (current becomes16). so the list becomes [16].

Which is correct.

So the function process_add works as intended.

This function modifies the list L in-place. So for the DP transitions, each state is a list of numbers with no consecutive duplicates. For each possible state, and for each possible choice of x (2 or 4, if the current element in the sequence is 0), we can compute the next state by applying process_add.

Now, the problem is that for each step, the DP state is the list and the has_win flag. But for n=2000, and possible states, this could be very expensive.

But given that k is up to 11, the maximum possible value we care about is 2^k. Once any number in the list is >= 2^k, the has_win flag is set to True. So once the has_win flag is True, the rest of the steps can be handled by multiplying by 2^number_of_remaining_zeros, since any choices for those zeros would contribute to the count.

So the plan is:

- The DP will track states as (current_list, has_win) and the count of sequences leading to that state.

- For each position in the input sequence, for each possible state, and for each possible choice of 2/4 (if current element is 0), compute the next state and update the DP.

But to manage the states efficiently, we can represent the current_list as a tuple (since it's hashable), and use a dictionary for transitions.

Moreover, once has_win is True, we can ignore the current_list and just track the count of sequences that have already achieved a win. Because once has_win is True, adding any future elements (2 or 4) won't change the outcome.

So the DP can be split into two parts:

1. States where has_win is False: need to track the current_list and process the next element.

2. States where has_win is True: all subsequent choices contribute 2^m possibilities, where m is the number of zeros left.

Thus, the DP transitions can be handled as follows:

For each step i (from 0 to n-1):

   For each state in the current DP:

      if the state is has_win=True:

          multiply the count by the number of choices for the remaining zeros (including this step if needed) and add to the result.

      else:

          for each possible choice of x (2 or 4, depending on the current element in the sequence):

              compute the new_list by processing x into the current_list.

              check if new_list contains any element >= 2^k. If yes, the new has_win is True.

              add to the next state (new_list, new_has_win) the count multiplied by the number of choices.

But for each step, the current element in the sequence is fixed unless it's 0. If the current element is 2 or 4, there is no choice: x must be that value.

So, the code will need to handle the sequence elements as follows:

For each element in the input sequence:

   if it's 0: there are two choices (2 and 4).

   if it's 2 or 4: only one choice.

So, the number of possibilities for each step is:

   count = 1 if the element is 2 or 4, else 2.

But for the DP transitions, for each possible state, and for each possible choice (depending on the element), generate the next states.

But for 0 elements, the code will branch into two possibilities (2 and 4), each contributing to the next state.

Now, the main challenge is to efficiently represent the current_list in a way that can be used as a key in a dictionary for the DP. Since tuples are hashable, we can represent the current_list as a tuple of integers. For example, tuple([8,4,2]).

Moreover, when processing a new x (2 or 4), the new_list can be generated by the process_add function. But since process_add modifies the list in place, we need to create a copy for each possible state.

But to optimize, perhaps we can memoize the process of adding x to a list. However, for each possible list and x, the result is deterministic, so we can compute it once and cache it. But with the possible states being numerous, this may not be feasible.

Alternative approach: for each state (tuple) and x, compute the next tuple on the fly.

So, the steps for the DP:

Initialize the DP with the initial state: empty list, has_win=False, count=1.

For each element in the input sequence:

   Create a new DP dictionary for the next step.

   For each (current_tuple, current_has_win) in the current DP:

      current_count = current DP's count.

      if current_has_win is True:

          The remaining steps can be handled by multiplying by 2^m, where m is the number of zeros remaining (including this step if it's a 0).

          So, compute the number of zeros remaining from the current step to the end.

          For example, if the current step is i, and the sequence has elements s[i], s[i+1], ..., s[n-1], then the number of zeros is the sum of (s[j] == 0) for j from i to n-1.

          The contribution to the result is current_count * (2^m).

          But in the DP, once has_win is True, all subsequent steps contribute 2^m. So perhaps we can precompute the number of zeros for each position, and when a state transitions to has_win=True, immediately multiply by 2^m and add to the result.

          Alternatively, during the DP processing, when handling a state where has_win is True, the code can compute the number of zeros remaining (from the current step to the end), calculate 2^m, multiply by the current count, and add to the answer.

          Then, in the next steps, we can ignore the state since any further transitions would not affect the count.

      else:

          Determine the possible x values for this step.

          For each x in possible_x:

              compute the new_list by processing x into the current_tuple.

              check if new_list has any element >= 2^k. This can be done by scanning the elements of new_list.

              new_has_win = any(element >= target for element in new_list) or current_has_win.

              (Wait, current_has_win is False, since we are in the else branch. So new_has_win is whether the new_list contains any element >= target.)

              Then, add to the next DP state (tuple(new_list), new_has_win) the current_count multiplied by the number of choices (1 if the current element is not 0, else 1 per x choice).

              Wait, no. For example, if the current element is 0, then each x (2 and 4) is a choice, and for each, the next state is computed. So for 0 elements, the code will generate two possible transitions, each contributing current_count * 1 (since each x is a separate possibility). The total contribution for the 0 element is the sum of both possibilities.

              So, for each x in possible_x:

                  contribution = current_count * 1 (since each x is a choice, and the number of possibilities is multiplied by 1 per x).

So, for each step, the code will generate for each state:

   if the element is 0:

      for x in [2,4]:

          compute new_list, check for has_win.

          add to next_state.

   else:

      x is fixed.

      compute new_list and add to next_state.

So, for example, if the element is 2:

   x=2.

   compute new_list, check for has_win.

   add to next_state.

Thus, the code will need to:

- Precompute for each position in the sequence the number of zeros from that position to the end, to calculate 2^m for has_win states.

So, let's precompute an array zero_count, where zero_count[i] is the number of zeros in the sequence from index i to n-1.

This can be computed by iterating from the end.

For example:

zero_counts = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):

    zero_counts[i] = zero_counts[i+1] + (s[i] == 0)

Then, for a step i, the number of zeros remaining is zero_counts[i].

Then, when processing a state where has_win is True at step i, the contribution to the answer is current_count * (2 ** zero_counts[i]).

Thus, the code can accumulate the answer whenever a state transitions to has_win=True, and when processing has_win=True states.

Now, the code structure would be:

Read n, k.

Read the sequence s.

Precompute zero_counts.

Compute target = 2^k.

precompute pow2 = [1]*(n+1), with pow2[i] = 2^i mod MOD.

Then, initialize the DP:

dp = { (tuple(), False) : 1 }

answer = 0

for each step i in 0 to n-1:

    new_dp = defaultdict(int)

    for (current_tuple, current_has_win), cnt in dp.items():

        if current_has_win:

            # add to answer: cnt * 2^m, where m is zero_counts[i]

            answer = (answer + cnt * pow(2, zero_counts[i], MOD)) % MOD

            continue

        current_list = list(current_tuple)

        current_element = s[i]

        possible_x = []

        if current_element == 0:

            possible_x = [2,4]

        elif current_element in (2,4):

            possible_x = [current_element]

        else:

            # invalid, but input is guaranteed to be 0, 2,4

            pass

        for x in possible_x:

            new_list = process_add(current_list.copy(), x)

            new_has_win = any(num >= target for num in new_list)

            if new_has_win:

                # contribute cnt * pow(2, zero_counts[i+1])

                # but since this is for step i, after processing x, the remaining steps are i+1 to n-1.

                # the number of zeros after i+1 is zero_counts[i+1]

                contribution = cnt * pow(2, zero_counts[i+1], MOD)

                answer = (answer + contribution) % MOD

            else:

                # add to new_dp

                new_tuple = tuple(new_list)

                new_dp_key = (new_tuple, new_has_win)

                new_dp[new_dp_key] = (new_dp[new_dp_key] + cnt) % MOD

    dp = new_dp

# after processing all steps, check the remaining states in dp that have has_win=True

for (current_tuple, current_has_win), cnt in dp.items():

    if current_has_win:

        answer = (answer + cnt) % MOD

print(answer)

Wait, but after processing all steps, any remaining state in dp has processed all elements. So, if current_has_win is True, then add the count to the answer. Otherwise, no.

So, in the code, after the loop, for each state in the final dp, if has_win is True, add the count to the answer.

But during processing each step, when a state is has_win=True, the code adds the contribution of cnt * 2^m, where m is the number of zeros remaining from that step onwards. So the code accumulates the answer for all possible choices after that step.

So the code should correctly calculate all possible sequences that have at least one tile >= target.

Now, the main issue is the efficiency of the DP transitions. The number of possible states depends on the number of different current_tuple that can be generated.

What's the maximum possible number of current_tuple states?

Each current_tuple is a list of numbers, each at least 2, and no two consecutive elements are equal.

Each element in the tuple can be a power of 2 (since merging 2's and 4's can lead to powers of 2). For example:

2, 4, 8, 16, etc.

But each element must be a power of 2. So each element is 2^m where m >=1.

But the sequence of elements must have no two consecutive elements equal.

So, the possible elements in the tuple can be any power of 2, but adjacent elements must differ.

Moreover, the order of elements is important.

But for the problem, once any element in the tuple is >= 2^k, the state transitions to has_win=True and is handled differently.

But until that point, the elements must all be < 2^k.

For example, if k=4, target is 16. So any tuple with elements <16. Once any element is 16 or higher, the state is has_win=True.

So, the elements in the tuple can be up to 2^(k-1).

For example, for k=4, the elements can be up to 8.

So, the possible elements are 2,4,8 (each is 2^m, m=1,2,3).

Moreover, the tuples can be of varying lengths.

So, the number of possible tuples depends on k.

For k=11, target is 2048. So the elements can be up to 2^10=1024.

So each element is a power of 2 from 2 up to 2^{k-1}, but with the constraint that consecutive elements are different.

So, the possible elements in the tuple are 2,4,8,...,2^{k-1}.

The maximum possible length of the tuple is ? For example, if each element alternates between 2 and 4 (but they can't be the same consecutive), so the length can be up to 2000. But when merging occurs, the length decreases.

But for k=11, the possible elements are 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^10 (since 2^10 is 1024, which is less than 2048). So there are 10 possible values for each element. But consecutive elements must differ.

So the number of possible tuples is similar to the number of sequences where each element is from 10 possible values, and no two consecutive elements are the same. The number of such sequences of length m is 10 * 9^{m-1}.

But the length of the tuple can vary. For example, after adding elements, the tuple can grow or shrink.

But for n=2000 steps, and for k=11, the number of possible tuples can be very large. However, perhaps in practice, many of these states are not reachable, so the actual number of states manageable.

But even with k=11, for each step, the possible number of states could be up to 10 * 9^{m} for m up to 2000. Which is way too big.

But this approach would not work for n=2000 and k=11. So, there must be a smarter way.

Wait, but perhaps the process of adding numbers and merging can be modeled in a way that the state can be represented more compactly.

Another observation: the merging process after adding a new number depends on the current last elements. So, when adding a new number x, the merging process affects the rightmost elements of the list. So the state after merging depends only on the suffix of the current list.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as a state where the list is a stack, and each new element is merged with the top of the stack if possible.

Wait, during the merging process, when you add a new x, you start from the end (right) and merge with the previous element as long as possible. So the merging process is only influenced by the elements to the left of the new x.

Therefore, the current state can be represented by the entire list. But again, this seems difficult.

Alternative idea: For the purpose of the problem, we only need to track the current list of elements, but once any element in the list reaches 2^k or higher, the sequence is winning. So perhaps, for the DP state, we can track the last few elements of the list, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the merging process is done from the right to the left, and each new element can only merge with the previous elements, perhaps the state can be represented as a stack, where each element is a power of 2 and different from the previous.

But this is the same as the list representation.

Hmm. So perhaps the solution is to proceed with the initial approach and see if it can be optimized.

But for n=2000 and k=11, the number of possible states would be too large.

Wait, but for each step, the maximum possible number of elements in the list is O(n), but each element is a power of 2 up to 2^{k-1}.

For k=11, this is up to 2^10 = 1024. So the elements are 2,4,8,...,1024.

So the elements can take up to k-1 possible values (since 2^m where m ranges from 1 to k-1).

The possible states are tuples where each element is one of these values, and consecutive elements are different.

The number of possible tuples depends on the number of possible combinations of these elements.

The number of possible tuples of length m is (k-1) * (k-2)^(m-1).

Summing over all possible m (from 0 to, say, n), the total number of possible tuples is:

sum_{m=0}^{n} (k-1) * (k-2)^{m-1} }

Which for k=11 is sum_{m=0} (10 * 9^{m-1} ) ... but even for m=10, this becomes 10 * 9^9 = 10 * 387,420,489 ≈ 3.8e9. Which is way too big.

But this is a theoretical upper bound. In practice, merging would lead to shorter lists. For example, when adding a number that merges multiple times, the list length can decrease.

But even so, for n=2000 steps, this approach is not feasible for k=11.

This suggests that the initial approach is not efficient enough, and we need a different way to model the state.

Alternative approach: Notice that when adding a new number, the merging process can be determined by the last element of the current list.

Wait, for example:

If the last element is equal to the new x, they merge into 2x. Then, the new 2x may merge with the previous element if they are equal, and so on.

So, the merging process can be viewed as a chain of merges, each determined by the previous elements.

But this chain depends on the entire suffix of the list. For example, after merging the new x with the last element, the resulting value may merge with the previous element, and so on until the start of the list.

But how can we model this with a state that is not the entire list?

Hmm. Perhaps the key is that the merging process after adding x can be determined by the current last element of the list, and the result of merging x with it. But this is only possible if the merging process depends only on the last element.

But this is not the case. For example:

Current list: [a, b, c], where a != b, b != c.

Adding x: if x == c, merge into 2c. Then check if 2c == b, and so on.

So the merging process depends on the entire suffix of the list. So the state cannot be compressed beyond the entire list.

This seems to suggest that the initial approach is not feasible for the problem constraints, and we need to find a smarter way.

Wait, but in practice, for small k (like up to 11), the maximum possible tile is 2048 (for k=11), and once a tile reaches 2048 or higher, the state transitions to has_win=True. So, for the DP, once a tile reaches 2048, we can handle it separately.

Moreover, the list can have elements up to 2^(k-1) (since once they reach 2^k, the state is has_win=True).

So, for k=11, the possible elements are 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^10.

Each element is a power of 2, and consecutive elements must be different.

Thus, the state can be represented as a list where each element is one of these values, and consecutive elements are different.

But how many such possible lists are there for n=2000 steps?

The number of possible lists increases exponentially with the list length, which is a problem.

But perhaps the list length can't be more than O(k) steps. Because merging can lead to higher elements, which may eventually reach the target.

Wait, but even if the list length can be up to n steps, it's not manageable.

Hmm. Another observation: the problem requires that the sequence of numbers (after processing) leads to at least one tile >= 2^k. So, the problem can be rephrased as: find the number of sequences where, after processing all numbers, the maximum tile in any step is >= 2^k.

But for each step, adding a number can cause merges, potentially creating a new tile. If any of these tiles during any step is >= 2^k, then the sequence is valid.

So the solution must track whether any of the steps has produced a tile >= 2^k.

But this doesn't change the approach much, as the current state must track whether the maximum tile so far is >= 2^k.

But in the initial approach, the has_win flag tracks whether the current state's list has a tile >= 2^k. But that's not sufficient, because in some steps, the list may have a tile >= 2^k, but later steps may merge it into a higher tile (still >= 2^k), but the has_win flag is already True.

Wait, no. Once has_win is True, it remains True for all subsequent steps. So the flag correctly tracks whether any step up to that point has generated a tile >= 2^k.

So the initial approach is correct.

But the problem is the number of states for large k.

Another Idea: For the DP, we don't need to track the entire list. We just need to track the last element of the list, and some information about the previous elements that might affect merging when adding a new number.

For example, when adding a new number x, the merging process depends only on the last element of the current list. If x is the same as the last element, they merge into 2x, and then we need to check if this new value is the same as the new previous element (now the one before last in the current list), and so on.

But this suggests that the merging process can be modeled as a stack. Each time a new element is added, it's merged with the top of the stack as long as possible.

So, the merging process can be viewed as a stack-based operation. So the state can be represented by the current stack (list of elements, each different from the previous), and the has_win flag.

But this is the same as the initial approach. So it seems that the stack is the correct model, but the number of states is too large.

Alternative Idea: The merging process for adding a new x can be determined by the current stack's tail, i.e., the last element. For example, adding x can only merge with the last element, then possibly the new merged element can merge with the previous one, etc. So the process is that each merge affects the top of the stack. So the state can be represented as a stack of elements, but each element is different from the previous.

But even this model requires tracking the entire stack, which is the same as the initial approach.

Wait, but perhaps the merging process can be modeled as a sequence of merges that depend only on the current value being merged and the previous element in the stack. So, during merging, the current value is updated by merging with the previous elements in reverse order.

For example:

current_value = x

while stack and stack[-1] == current_value:

    current_value *=2

    stack.pop()

stack.append(current_value)

This is a common approach in problems involving merging adjacent elements. For example, this is how some of the "collapsing" problems are handled.

Wait, yes! That's a key insight. The merging process for a new x can be modeled by the following steps:

Initialize current_value as x.

While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is equal to current_value:

    current_value *= 2

    pop the top of the stack.

Append current_value to the stack.

This process correctly models the merging steps. For example:

Stack before adding x: [a, b, c], current_value is x.

If c == x:

    current_value becomes 2x.

    stack becomes [a, b].

    if b == 2x:

        current_value becomes 4x.

        stack becomes [a].

        if a ==4x:

            current_value becomes 8x.

            stack becomes empty.

Append 8x to stack.

So the resulting stack is [8x].

This approach models the merging process correctly.

So, the merging can be modeled by a stack where each time a new x is added, it's merged with the top of the stack as long as they are equal, and the merged value doubles each time.

Thus, the state can be represented by the stack and the has_win flag.

But with this model, the stack after merging will have elements where no two consecutive elements are equal. This is exactly what the initial approach requires.

So, the merging process can be represented as:

def process_add(stack, x):

    current = x

    while stack and stack[-1] == current:

        current *= 2

        stack.pop()

    stack.append(current)

    return stack

But this is a more efficient way to model the merging process. It uses a stack, and for each new x, we process it by merging with the top of the stack as long as possible.

But how does this model compare to the initial approach? It's the same as the initial approach. So, the state can be represented as the stack, and the has_win flag.

The key advantage here is that the merging process can be modeled with a stack, which allows for a more efficient state representation.

But the problem remains: for large k and n, the number of possible stack states is too high.

But perhaps this model allows us to find a way to compress the state.

Another observation: The stack can be represented as a sequence of elements, each of which is a power of 2, and no two consecutive elements are the same. Moreover, each element must be <= 2^{k-1} (since once any element >= 2^k, the has_win flag is set).

So, for k=11, the elements are up to 2^10.

But the number of possible stacks is still potentially large.

But for each element in the stack, the value is a power of 2. So, each element can be represented as the exponent (e.g., 2^3 is represented as 3). This reduces the storage and comparison of elements.

Additionally, since consecutive elements must differ, the stack can be represented as a list of exponents, where each consecutive pair is different.

So, the stack is a list of exponents (each >=1, up to k-1), with no two consecutive exponents being the same.

For example, a stack [2, 3, 2] (representing 4, 8, 4) is invalid, because 3 and 2 are different. Wait, but in this case, the exponents are different, so the elements are different, which is allowed.

So the stack can have elements like [3, 4, 3], which is allowed.

The number of possible stack states depends on the exponents and the length of the stack.

For example, for k=11, exponents can be from 1 to 10.

The number of possible stack states is the same as the number of possible sequences of exponents where no two consecutive exponents are the same. The number of such sequences is (k-1) * (k-2)^{m-1} for a stack of length m.

But for m up to 2000, this is not feasible.

But perhaps there's a pattern or mathematical model that allows us to represent the state transitions without explicitly tracking each stack.

Another Idea: Since the merging process only depends on the current stack's top, and the new x, perhaps the state can be represented by the current top of the stack and some aggregate information about the previous elements. However, this is not obvious.

Alternatively, the state can be represented by the current top of the stack, and the maximum exponent in the stack. Because once the maximum exponent reaches or exceeds k, the has_win flag is True.

But this is not sufficient. For example, the maximum exponent might be in the middle of the stack. Adding a new x might merge with the top and create a new exponent that is larger, but perhaps not exceeding k.

But the has_win flag is only True if any element in the stack has exponent >= k.

So, if we track the maximum exponent in the stack, then the has_win flag can be determined by whether this maximum is >=k.

So, the state can be represented by:

- The current stack (represented as a list of exponents, no consecutive duplicates).

- The maximum exponent in the stack.

But again, this requires tracking the entire stack.

Alternative Idea: For the purpose of the has_win flag, once the maximum exponent is >=k, the flag is True, and all further steps can be considered as contributing to the answer. So, the state can be represented by the stack's top exponent, and the maximum exponent so far.

But this is not sufficient, because the merging process depends on the entire stack. For example, adding a new x may merge with the top of the stack, and the resulting merged exponent may merge with the previous exponent.

For example:

Stack is [3, 2]. Exponents 3 and 2 (8 and 4).

Add x=4 (exponent 2). The merging process:

current exponent is 2. Stack top is 2. So merge to exponent 3.

Stack becomes [3]. current exponent is 3. Stack is not empty, stack top is 3. Merge to exponent 4.

Stack becomes empty. Append 4.

So, the resulting stack is [4].

The merging process here depends on the previous exponents in the stack.

So, the state can't be represented solely by the top exponent and maximum exponent. We need to know the entire stack to model the merging process correctly.

Thus, this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Perhaps the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming with the state being the current top of the stack and the current maximum exponent. This would drastically reduce the number of states, but it's not clear if this is possible.

For example, when adding x, the merging process depends only on the current top of the stack, and the new top after merging. However, this is not the case, as previous elements may merge with the new merged value.

For example, suppose the stack is [3, 3]. Wait, no. The stack cannot have two consecutive 3's. So the stack must have elements with different consecutive exponents.

Wait, the stack must have elements where consecutive exponents are different. So the stack is a sequence of exponents with no consecutive duplicates.

So, the stack is a sequence of exponents e1, e2, ..., em, where e1 != e2, e2 != e3, etc.

When adding a new x (which is 2 or 4, so exponent is 1 or 2), the merging process proceeds as follows:

current_e = exponent of x (1 for 2, 2 for 4)

while stack is not empty and stack[-1] == current_e:

    current_e += 1

    stack.pop()

stack.append(current_e)

Thus, the merging process for x is to add its exponent, then merge with the top of the stack (if equal) as many times as possible.

This is the key insight. For example, when adding x=4 (exponent 2), the initial current_e is 2. If the stack's top is 2, then merge, current_e becomes 3, pop the top. If the new top is 3, merge again, current_e becomes 4, and so on.

Thus, the merging process for x depends only on the current stack's top elements, and can be modeled as follows:

current_e = exponent of x (log2(x))

while stack and stack[-1] == current_e:

    current_e += 1

    stack.pop()

stack.append(current_e)

The resulting stack is the new state.

So, the state is represented by the stack of exponents, where consecutive exponents are different.

Each exponent in the stack is >=1, and each consecutive exponents are different.

The maximum exponent in the stack is tracked to determine if has_win is True.

So, the state can be represented as the stack of exponents and the maximum exponent.

But how to model this efficiently?

The key observation here is that the merging process for x depends only on the exponents in the stack and the exponent of x. Moreover, once a merge occurs, the current exponent increases by 1 for each merge.

Thus, the state can be represented by the stack of exponents, but this stack can be built by processing each new x's exponent.

But even so, the number of possible states is still large.

But perhaps the stack can be represented in a way that allows for some compression.

For example, the stack's elements are exponents that form a sequence of non-consecutive values. For example, after merging, the stack can have exponents that are increasing or varying.

But I'm not sure.

Another Idea: Each time you add an exponent e, you merge as much as possible, leading to a new exponent that is e + m, where m is the number of merges. For example, adding e=2 to a stack with top elements [2, 3, 2], the merges would occur as follows:

current_e = 2

Stack is [2,3,2]. The top is 2. Merge: current_e becomes 3, stack becomes [2,3].

Top is 3, which is not equal to current_e (3 != 3? Wait, no. The current_e is 3, and the stack's top is 3. So they merge.

So, after merging once, current_e becomes 4, stack becomes [2].

Then, stack's top is 2, which is not equal to 4. So append 4. The stack is [2,4].

Thus, the merging process can lead to a variable number of merges, but each merge increases the current exponent by 1.

Thus, the merging process for x can be modeled as follows:

current_e = log2(x)  # 1 for 2, 2 for 4

while stack and stack[-1] == current_e:

    current_e += 1

    stack.pop()

stack.append(current_e)

The maximum exponent in the stack is the maximum of the previous maximum and current_e.

Thus, the state can be represented by the stack and the maximum exponent.

But even with this, the number of possible stack states is large.

But perhaps, for the DP, we can track the stack in reverse order, i.e., as a list of exponents, but this doesn't reduce the number of possible states.

Another Idea: Since the merging process for x can only affect the suffix of the stack, the state can be represented by the current stack's suffix that can affect future merges. However, this is not clear.

Alternatively, since each new x's merging process only affects the top of the stack, the state can be represented by the current stack's top exponents and their count. But this also seems challenging.

At this point, I'm stuck. The initial approach seems correct but not feasible for large n and k. However, considering the problem's constraints (n=2000, k=11), and the allowed time and memory limits, perhaps the initial approach is manageable with some optimizations.

Let's proceed with the initial approach, but optimize the state representation.

The state is represented by the current tuple of exponents (or their corresponding values), and the has_win flag.

But using exponents instead of values can save space. For example, each element is a power of 2, represented by its exponent.

So, the stack can be represented as a tuple of exponents, e.g., (3, 2, 4) corresponds to 8,4,16.

Moreover, the maximum exponent in the stack can be tracked as part of the state, but in the initial approach, the has_win flag is determined by whether any exponent in the stack is >=k.

So, the has_win flag can be derived from the maximum exponent.

Thus, the state can be represented as a tuple of exponents (stack), and the has_win flag is True if any exponent in the stack is >=k.

So, during the DP transitions, when processing a new x, we compute the new stack of exponents, check if any exponent is >=k, and set the has_win flag accordingly.

Thus, the state can be represented as the tuple of exponents in the stack, and the has_win flag.

Now, the code would look something like this:

MOD = 10**9 +7

n, k = map(int, input().split())

s = list(map(int, input().split()))

target_exp = k

zero_counts = [0]*(n+1)

for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):

    zero_counts[i] = zero_counts[i+1] + (s[i] == 0)

# Precompute pow2 for zero counts

pow2 = [1]*(n+1)

for i in range(1, n+1):

    pow2[i] = (pow2[i-1] *2 ) % MOD

from collections import defaultdict

dp = defaultdict(int)

dp[ (tuple(), False) ] = 1

answer =0

for i in range(n):

    new_dp = defaultdict(int)

    current_s = s[i]

    for (stack_tuple, has_win), cnt in dp.items():

        if has_win:

            # contribute to answer

            m = zero_counts[i]

            ans = (pow(2, m, MOD) * cnt) % MOD

            answer = (answer + ans) % MOD

            continue

        # Determine possible x values

        if current_s ==0:

            possible_x = [1,2]  # exponents for 2 and 4

        elif current_s ==2:

            possible_x = [1]

        else:

            possible_x = [2]

        for x_exp in possible_x:

print(answer)

This code models the stack using exponents, which are easier to handle. The merging process is handled by current_e and the stack.

Each state is a tuple of exponents (stack) and the has_win flag.

But even with this, for k=11, the exponents can be up to 10. So the stack can have elements up to 10.

But the length of the stack can be up to n steps, leading to a large number of possible states.

However, the code may work for the problem constraints, especially considering that the merging process tends to keep the stack size small. For example, each merge reduces the stack length by 1 and increases the current exponent. So for sequences that merge often, the stack length remains small.

For example, adding a series of 4s:

Step 1: add 4 (exp 2). Stack is [2].

Step 2: add 4. current_e=2. Stack's last is 2. Merge to exp 3. Stack becomes [3].

Step 3: add 4. current_e=2. Stack's last is 3. Append 2. Stack is [3,2].

Step 4: add 4. current_e=2. Stack's last is 2. Merge to 3. Stack becomes [3]. current_e=3. Merge with 3? No, because the new current_e is 3, stack's last is 3 (from previous step). So merge again, current_e becomes 4. Stack becomes empty. Append 4.

So after four steps, the stack is [4].

Thus, the stack length is 1.

So, the code may handle such cases with small stacks.

But in the worst case, where no merging occurs (e.g., adding 2 and 4 alternately), the stack length can grow to n. For n=2000, this would be a problem.

But given that k is up to 11 and the time limit is 1 second, this code may not pass the largest test cases.

But given that the problem is from a programming contest and the code must pass within the time constraints, perhaps this approach is the intended solution.

Let's test it with the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

Input:

7 4

2 2 4 2 2 2 2

Output:1

Let's see:

k=4, target_exp=4.

The sequence is all 2 and 4, but the code would process each element.

Let's trace:

Initial state: empty stack, has_win=False, count=1.

Step 0: s[i]=2, so x_exp=1.

Processing:

stack is empty. current_e=1. append. stack is [1]. new_max=1 <4. new_has_win is False. So new_dp has ([1], False) → count=1.

Step 1: s[i]=2, x_exp=1.

Processing:

current_e=1. stack is [1]. merge: current_e becomes 2. stack is empty. append 2. new_max=2 <4. new_has_win is False. new_dp: ([2], False) → count=1.

Step 2: s[i]=4. x_exp=2.

current_e=2. stack is [2]. merge: current_e becomes3. stack is empty. append3. new_max=3 <4. new_has_win is False. new_dp: ([3], False) → count=1.

Step 3: s[i]=2 → x_exp=1.

current_e=1. stack is [3]. append 1. new_max=3. new_has_win False. new_dp: ([3,1], False) → count=1.

Step4: s[i]=2 → x_exp=1.

current_e=1. stack is [3,1]. append 1. but stack[-1] is 1, same as current_e. So merge: current_e becomes2. stack becomes [3]. append 2. new_max=3. new_has_win False. new_dp: ([3,2], False) → count=1.

Step5: s[i]=2 → x_exp=1.

current_e=1. stack is [3,2]. append1. new_max=3. new_has_win False. new_dp: ([3,2,1], False) → count=1.

Step6: s[i]=2 → x_exp=1.

current_e=1. stack is [3,2,1]. append1. merge: current_e=2. stack becomes [3,2]. append2. merge: current_e=3. stack becomes [3]. append3. merge: current_e=4. stack is empty. append4.

new_max=4 → new_has_win is True.

So during this step, the new_has_win is True.

The remaining zeros after step6 is zero (since it's the last step). So m=0.

Contribution is cnt * 2^0 = 1 *1 =1. So answer is 1.

Thus, the code would output 1, which matches the sample.

Other samples can be checked similarly.

Thus, the code seems correct.

Now, the code needs to be written in Python with proper handling of the DP transitions.

But considering that for each step, the number of states can be large, the code may not be fast enough for the largest test cases. However, given that the problem's constraints for k are up to 11, and the code uses exponents to model the stack, it's possible that the number of possible states is manageable.

Another optimization is to use memoization for the stack processing. For example, the code can precompute the new stack for a given current stack and x_exp. But in Python, tuples are hashable and can be used as keys. But in practice, the code may still be too slow for n=2000 and k=11.

But given the problem's time constraints, this is the best approach I can think of.
