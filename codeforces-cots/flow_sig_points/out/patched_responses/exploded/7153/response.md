Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So the task is to replace all the question marks in the given string such that it becomes a palindrome, contains each of the first k letters at least once, and is lexicographically smallest possible. If it's not possible, output IMPOSSIBLE.

Hmm. First, I need to understand all the constraints and how to approach generating the correct string.

So the main steps are:

1. Ensure the resulting string is a palindrome. That means for each position i, the character must match the character at position len(s)-1 -i. So any existing characters that are not question marks must already form a palindrome. Otherwise, it's impossible. For example, if the first character is 'a' and the last is 'b', then it's impossible.

Wait, right. So first, check the existing characters. For each position i, if both s[i] and s[mirror] are not '?', they must be equal. If one is not '?', then the other must be set to that character. Otherwise, we can choose a character for them.

Wait, but when there are question marks, how to handle them. For example, if s[i] is 'a' and the mirror is '?', then the mirror must become 'a'. Similarly, if both are '?', then we need to choose a character that allows the overall string to satisfy the conditions.

So first, before even considering the other constraints, we need to process the string to ensure that after replacing the question marks, it's a palindrome. So the initial step is to check if the existing non-question mark characters are compatible with forming a palindrome.

For example, in the first sample input, "a?c". The length is 3. The middle character (index 1) is '?'. The first and third characters are 'a' and 'c' which are different. So since those are fixed and not equal, it's impossible to form a palindrome, hence the output is IMPOSSIBLE.

So first, the code must check all existing non-? characters and their mirrors. If any pair is mismatched (both are non-? and different), then output IMPOSSIBLE.

So that's the first check.

Once the existing characters are valid, then we need to replace the question marks such that the resulting string is a palindrome. Also, after that, the string must use all first k letters at least once, and be lex smallest possible.

But how to approach this?

Let's think step by step.

First, process the string to make it a palindrome. For each pair (i, mirror_i), if one is a question mark and the other is a character, set both to that character. If both are '?', then we need to choose a character for them. But here's the thing: the choice of these characters affects whether all k letters are present. Also, since we need the lex smallest possible string, when replacing a pair of '?'s, we want the earliest possible character in the alphabet that allows the final string to meet all constraints.

But wait, how do we balance between making the string lex smallest and ensuring that all k letters are present?

This seems a bit tricky. Let's break it down.

The steps could be:

1. Check if the existing non-? characters are compatible with forming a palindrome. If not, output IMPOSSIBLE.

2. Replace all question marks in a way that the string becomes a palindrome. For each pair (i, mirror_i), if one is '?', replace with the other's character. If both are '?', we need to choose a character for them. But during this step, we need to also track which characters are used and ensure that all k letters are present in the final string.

Wait, but how to manage that? Because after replacing the question marks to form a palindrome, the resulting string may not have all k letters. So we need to make sure that after forming the palindrome, all k letters are present.

So perhaps the approach is:

- First, process the string to form a palindrome by replacing all '?', but during this process, track the possible characters used.

But the problem is that during this step, the way we replace the '?'s (especially the pairs where both are '?') will determine which characters are present. So to satisfy the condition that all k letters are present, we need to ensure that after replacing all '?', the set of characters includes all k letters.

But how to achieve that while also making the string lex smallest?

This seems like a backtracking problem, but given the input size (up to 100 characters), perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe the approach is:

- Generate the minimal possible palindrome (lex order) by replacing '?', then check if all k letters are present. If yes, output it. If not, see if we can adjust some positions to include the missing letters.

But how to do that efficiently.

Let me think: when building the palindrome, for each pair of '?'s (i and mirror), we can choose a character. To make the lex smallest, we would prefer the smallest possible character (like 'a') for each. However, choosing 'a' might lead to missing some required letters. So we need to balance this.

So the idea is to first create the lex smallest possible palindrome by filling the '?'s with the earliest possible letters, then check if all k letters are present. If they are, we are done. If not, we need to find positions where we can replace some of the filled '?'s with higher letters (to include the missing ones) in a way that still maintains the lex order.

But how to do this in a way that ensures the lex smallest possible string.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Check for any existing mismatches (non-? pairs that are different). If found, output impossible.

2. For all pairs (i, mirror_i):

   a. If both are non-? and equal, proceed.

   b. If one is non-? and the other is '?', replace the '?' with the non-? character.

   c. If both are '?', then we need to choose a character for them. To make the lex smallest, we want to choose the smallest possible character (like 'a'). But once all pairs are filled, we need to ensure that all k letters are present.

But after filling all pairs with the smallest possible, perhaps some letters are missing. So in that case, we have to adjust some pairs (starting from the rightmost possible to maintain lex order) to use higher letters.

Wait, but the lex smallest string is achieved by making the earliest possible differences as small as possible. So when adjusting, we need to replace the latest possible positions (from the end towards the beginning) with higher characters to include the missing ones, but in a way that the lex order is maintained.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is:

- Fill all the '?' pairs with 'a's (or the earliest possible characters) to form the lex smallest palindrome.

- Check if all k letters are present. If yes, output.

- If not, find the positions where we can replace some 'a's with higher letters to include the missing ones. But since the replacement must be done in a way that the string remains a palindrome and lex order is minimized, this seems tricky.

Wait, but for the lex order to be minimized, whenever we have a choice, we have to choose the earliest possible character. So perhaps the process is:

- First, fill all the pairs with 'a's (or the earliest possible) where possible.

- Then, check if all k letters are present.

- If not, we have to find which pairs can be modified to higher letters (but as late as possible in the string to not affect the lex order as much), ensuring that all required letters are included.

But how to do this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is similar to generating the lex smallest palindrome, but with the additional constraint that all k letters are present.

In such cases, the approach would be to generate the lex smallest possible palindrome, then check for the presence of all k letters. If not present, then try modifying the earliest possible positions to include the missing letters, but without breaking the lex order.

But perhaps the correct approach is:

1. Preprocess the string into a palindrome by replacing all '?' as per the rules (for pairs where one is '?', replace with the other's character; for pairs where both are '?', set to 'a' to make lex smallest). But then check if this preprocessed string has all k letters.

But the problem is that this approach may not use all k letters, even if possible.

Alternatively, perhaps we can first process the string to form a palindrome, then check if all k letters are present. If not, check if there are pairs of '?' (which were set to some character) that can be adjusted to include the missing letters.

But how to adjust them in a way that the lex order is still minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps when filling the '?' pairs (where both are '?'), instead of setting them to 'a's, we can set them to some character that allows all k letters to be present, while keeping the lex order as small as possible.

But this seems difficult. How do we decide which pairs to set to which letters to include all k letters, while making the lex order as small as possible.

Hmm.

Another idea: the minimal lex order is achieved by setting the earliest possible positions to the smallest possible letters. But when we have to include certain letters (all k letters), perhaps some positions have to be set to higher letters. We need to find the earliest possible positions where a higher letter is needed and set those to the minimal possible higher letters required.

Wait, but how to do that.

Alternatively, the problem can be broken into two parts:

a) Fill the palindrome in lex smallest way, regardless of the all-k-letters constraint.

b) Check if all k letters are present. If yes, output. If not, see if there's a way to replace some pairs (which are currently set to lower letters) with higher letters (starting from the end to keep lex order as small as possible) to include the missing letters.

For example, in the second sample input:

2
a??a

After processing, the two middle positions (indices 1 and 2) are '?'. So in the lex smallest palindrome, they would be filled as 'a's, making the string 'aaaa'. But this doesn't include 'b' (since k=2). So the algorithm would check that 'b' is missing. Then, it would look for the rightmost pair (i and mirror) that can be changed to a higher letter (here, 'b') to include 'b'. Changing the middle pair to 'bb' gives 'abba', which includes both 'a' and 'b'. And since this is the earliest possible change (from the right), it's the lex smallest possible.

So the approach would be:

1. Process the string into a palindrome, replacing '?'s with the earliest possible characters.

2. Check if all k letters are present. If yes, output.

3. If not, find the rightmost pair of '?'s (in the original string) that were set to a lower character, and try to replace them with higher characters (starting from the current character upwards) in lex order, ensuring that all missing letters are included.

But how to implement this.

Let me think of the steps in code.

First, process the string to form a palindrome, replacing each pair of '?'s with the smallest possible character (like 'a').

For each position i from 0 to (n-1)/2:

   if s[i] and s[mirror] are both '?', set them to 'a'.

But wait, maybe that's not the case. Wait, for the lex smallest, when both are '?', we want to set them to the smallest possible character (e.g., 'a'), but perhaps even lower than 'a' if possible. But the problem says that the allowed letters are the first k letters. So for k=3, allowed letters are a, b, c. So the smallest is 'a'.

So in the initial processing step, for each pair of '?', set them to 'a' (smallest possible). Then, after this, check if all k letters are present.

If yes, output.

If no, then try to adjust some pairs to include the missing letters, starting from the end of the string to maintain lex order.

So the plan is:

- After building the initial palindrome (all 'a's where possible), collect the set of letters used.

- If the size of the set is less than k, then we need to add the missing letters.

But how?

We need to find pairs of positions (i and mirror) that were set to 'a's (or other letters) and can be changed to higher letters to include the missing ones.

But since we need the lex smallest possible, we should make these changes as late as possible in the string. Because changing a later character to a higher value affects the lex order less than changing an earlier character.

So the approach is:

- Iterate from the end of the string towards the beginning, looking for pairs that can be adjusted to include the missing letters.

Wait, but for each pair (i, mirror_i), changing them from 'a' to 'b' would make the string lex larger. So we need to find the earliest possible position (from the end) where changing the pair's character to a higher one would allow including the missing letters.

But how to choose which pair to change and to which character.

Alternatively, for each missing letter, we need to find a pair that can be set to that letter.

So here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Check existing non-? characters for palindrome compatibility.

2. Generate the initial palindrome by replacing all '?' as follows:

   For each pair (i, mirror_i):

      if one is non-? and the other is '?', set the '?' to the non-? character.

      if both are '?', set them to 'a'.

3. Check if the resulting string uses all k letters. If yes, output.

4. If not, then:

   Find the list of missing letters (the first k letters not present in the current string).

   For each missing letter c:

      Find the rightmost possible pair (i, mirror_i) that is currently set to a character less than c. Then, change that pair to c. But this would require that this change allows us to include c, and that after this, the rest of the pairs can be filled with the smallest possible characters (to maintain lex order).

Wait, but perhaps this is not sufficient. For example, if we have multiple missing letters, changing one pair might add one of them, but others may still be missing.

This seems complicated.

Alternatively, after generating the initial string, if the count of unique letters is less than k, then the problem is to adjust the initial string by replacing some 'a's (or other letters) with higher letters to include the missing ones, but in such a way that the resulting string is lex smallest possible.

To do this, perhaps we can:

- For each position from the end to the start (so that we modify the latest possible positions first), check if the current pair can be changed to a higher letter that is in the allowed set and would help include a missing letter.

But how to select which letters to choose.

Alternatively, here's an algorithm inspired by generating the lex smallest palindrome with all k letters:

After the initial processing (step 1 and 2), collect the set of used letters. If the size is less than k, then:

   Find the minimal letters that are missing (e.g., for k=3, if letters a and c are present, then missing is b).

   Then, iterate through the pairs of the palindrome (from the end to the start) and find the first pair where the current character can be increased to include the missing letters, and then set it to the minimal possible higher character that covers all missing letters.

But this is vague. Let's think of a concrete example.

Take the second sample input:

k=2, s="a??a".

Initial processing:

After making the palindrome, the two middle '?'s are set to 'a's. So the string is "aaaa". The letters present are {'a'}, but k=2 requires 'a' and 'b'. So missing 'b'.

So we need to change one pair to 'b's. The rightmost possible pair is the middle pair (positions 1 and 2 in 0-based index). Changing them to 'b's gives "abba", which includes both 'a' and 'b'. Since this is the rightmost possible pair, this gives the lex smallest possible string.

Another example: input 3:

k=2, s="?b?a".

Processing the string to form a palindrome:

Original string is "?b?a".

Mirror positions:

0 and 3: '?' and 'a'. So the first character (0) must be 'a', and the third (3) must be 'a' (since the third is 'a', the first must be 'a'). Then the string becomes "ab?a".

Then, the middle positions (1 and 2). Original characters are 'b' and '?'. So the '?' is set to 'b'. So the string becomes "abba".

This uses both 'a' and 'b', so it's valid. So output is "abba".

So the initial approach works.

Another example: k=3, s="a?c". The existing characters are 'a' and 'c' which are not equal. So it's impossible.

So the first check is crucial.

Now, let's think of a way to implement this.

The steps in code would be:

- Check if the existing non-? characters form a palindrome. If any pair (i, mirror_i) have non-? and different characters, output IMPOSSIBLE.

- Process the string to form a palindrome by replacing '?'s. For each pair (i, mirror_i):

   If both are '?', set them to 'a' (or the first allowed letter?), wait, no. Wait, the allowed letters are the first k letters. So the minimal possible is 'a' (if k >=1).

So during initial processing, for any pair of '?', we set them to 'a'.

But wait, no. Wait, the allowed letters are the first k letters. So for example, if k=2, allowed letters are 'a' and 'b'. So when replacing a pair of '?', the minimal possible is 'a', which is allowed.

But in the initial processing, when both are '?', we set them to 'a's.

After this, we need to check whether all k letters are present.

If not, then we have to find some pairs that can be changed to higher letters (from the end towards the start) to include the missing letters.

So, code steps:

1. Check for existing conflicts (non-? pairs that are different). If conflict exists, output IMPOSSIBLE.

2. Convert the string into a palindrome by replacing all '?'. For each pair (i, mirror_i):

   a. If one is not '?', set both to that character.

   b. If both are '?', set to 'a'.

3. Check if the set of characters in the resulting string includes all first k letters. If yes, output the string.

4. If not, collect the missing letters.

5. Now, iterate through the pairs from the end towards the start. For each pair (i, mirror_i):

   a. If the current character is the minimal possible (e.g., 'a'), and the pair can be replaced with a higher character (from the allowed set) to include the missing letters.

   b. For example, if the pair is 'a', and we need to include 'b' and 'c', changing it to 'c' would include 'c', but maybe 'b' is still missing. So perhaps we need to find a way to include all missing letters.

But this seems complicated. How do we select which letters to replace.

Alternatively, the missing letters must be added. Let's say after initial processing, we have m missing letters (m = k - number of unique letters in the string). We need to replace some 'a's (or other letters) with letters from the missing set.

But how to do that in the minimal lex order.

Let's think of the example where k=2, initial string after processing is "aaaa". Missing 'b'. We need to replace one pair of 'a's with 'b's. To minimize lex order, we choose the rightmost possible pair. Because changing a later pair to a higher character would result in a lex smaller string than changing an earlier pair.

So for "aaaa", the pairs are (0,3), (1,2). The rightmost pair is (1,2). Changing them to 'b's gives "abba", which is lex smaller than changing (0,3) to 'b's ("bbaa"), which would be lex larger.

Thus, the strategy is to replace the rightmost possible pair with a higher character (as large as needed to include the missing letters) in order to make the lex order as small as possible.

So, to implement this:

For each pair in reverse order (starting from the end of the first half of the string):

   For each possible character c in the allowed letters, starting from the current character +1 up to the maximum allowed (k-th letter):

      if changing this pair to c would help in including the missing letters.

But how.

Another idea: the minimal number of missing letters is m = k - current count. To include all missing letters, at least m distinct letters need to be added.

But each pair can contribute at most one distinct letter (since the pair is two same characters). So for example, if two pairs are set to 'b', then that's one new distinct letter.

But perhaps, changing a pair to the highest possible missing letter would cover some missing.

Wait, perhaps the approach is:

Once we have the list of missing letters (say, missing = [ 'b', 'c' ] for k=3), we can iterate through the pairs from the end to the beginning. For each pair, try to set it to the largest possible missing letter (since this allows the earlier pairs to remain as small as possible, thus keeping lex order minimal). However, this may not cover all missing letters. So perhaps this approach requires multiple passes.

Alternatively, perhaps when we need to add multiple missing letters, we have to find multiple pairs to change.

But how to manage this.

Alternatively, when replacing a pair with a higher character, the character can be the maximum possible in the missing letters. For example, if missing letters are 'b' and 'c', then setting a pair to 'c' would cover 'c', and then another pair to 'b' would cover 'b'. But this requires that there are two pairs to change.

But the problem is that the number of missing letters can be up to k-1 (if initial processing uses only one letter). So the code needs to handle this.

But given the input size (100 characters), even a O(n^2) approach is acceptable.

Another approach: the initial processing fills the string with as many 'a's as possible, leading to a minimal lex string. To include the missing letters, we can greedily replace pairs from the end towards the start with the largest possible missing letters. This way, the lex order is as small as possible.

For example, in the case where we need to add 'b' and 'c', the first (rightmost) pair is set to 'c', which covers 'c', and then the next pair to 'b', which covers 'b'. Then, the resulting string would be lex smaller than setting the first pair to 'b' and the next to 'c'.

Wait, no. Let's see:

Original string after initial processing: "aaaa".

Missing letters: 'b' and 'c' (k=3).

If the rightmost pair (positions 1 and 2) are set to 'c', then the string becomes "acca". Now, the letters present are 'a' and 'c' (still missing 'b').

Then, the next pair (positions 0 and 3) are set to 'b', making "bccb". Now, the letters are 'b' and 'c' (missing 'a').

Wait, but this approach doesn't work. So this suggests that the approach of replacing pairs with the largest possible missing letters may not cover all the needed letters.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to replace the rightmost possible pair with the smallest missing letter. For example, in the case of missing 'b' and 'c', replace the rightmost pair with 'b' first, then any remaining missing letters (like 'c') can be added by other pairs.

But this also depends on the number of available pairs.

So perhaps the algorithm is:

After initial processing:

1. Collect the missing letters.

2. If no missing letters, return the string.

3. Else, iterate over pairs from the end towards the start.

4. For each pair (i, mirror_i):

   a. Find the smallest possible missing letter that is higher than the current character of the pair.

   b. Replace the pair with that letter.

   c. Check if all missing letters are now covered. If yes, proceed to fill the rest of the pairs with the minimal possible characters (to maintain lex order).

   d. If not, proceed to the next pair.

5. If after processing all pairs, the missing letters are not covered, output IMPOSSIBLE.

But how to handle multiple missing letters.

Alternatively, when replacing a pair, we can choose the smallest possible character (from the missing set) that is larger than the current character of the pair, to ensure that the lex order is as small as possible.

But this requires checking all possible characters for each pair.

Alternatively, for each pair, try to replace it with the smallest possible missing character that is higher than the current character. This would allow the earlier pairs to remain as small as possible.

Let me try to outline this.

For example:

Initial string is "aaaa" (k=3, missing 'b' and 'c').

Missing letters: ['b', 'c'].

Pairs are (0,3) and (1,2). Processing from right to left:

First pair (1,2) is current 'a'. The smallest missing letter higher than 'a' is 'b'.

Replace this pair with 'b's. Now string is "abba". Now, the missing letters are ['c'].

Next, pair (0,3) is 'a's. Replace with 'c's. Now string is "cbbc". Now all letters are present. But the lex order is now "cbbc", which is worse than "abba".

But wait, the sample input 2 had k=2 and the correct output was "abba", which includes both 'a' and 'b'.

Hmm, this suggests that the approach of replacing pairs with the smallest possible missing letters higher than current may not work. Because in the case where multiple letters are missing, replacing the rightmost pair with the smallest possible missing letter might allow the remaining pairs to be filled with higher letters that cover the rest.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to:

After initial processing, collect the missing letters. Then, for each pair (starting from the end towards the beginning), try to replace it with the minimal possible higher character that can contribute to covering the missing letters.

But how to determine which characters to choose.

Alternatively, for each pair (i, mirror_i) in reverse order:

   For each possible character c in the allowed letters (starting from current char +1 up to the maximum allowed):

      if c is one of the missing letters:

         create a new string where this pair is replaced with c.

         check if the new string (with the rest filled as per minimal lex) includes all required letters.

         if yes, then proceed to output this modified string.

         if not, proceed to the next higher c.

      else:

         check if replacing this pair with c allows for other pairs to be adjusted to include the missing letters.

But this seems like backtracking, which may be feasible given the small input size.

But how to implement this efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps after initial processing, the code can:

- For each pair in reverse order:

   - For each possible c in allowed letters, c >= current char, in lex order:

      - if c is higher than current char:

         replace the pair with c.

         fill all pairs to the right (earlier pairs) with minimal possible chars (like 'a').

         check if all letters are present.

         if yes, return this string.

So the idea is to try to find the earliest possible pair (from the end) where replacing it with a higher character (the smallest possible higher) allows the rest of the string to be filled with 'a's (or minimal chars) and still include all k letters.

But how to fill the rest with minimal chars. Because when you replace a pair with c, the rest of the pairs (to the left) can be filled with 'a's, which might not include all letters. So perhaps this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, when you replace a pair with c, you can then force the remaining pairs (those to the left) to be filled with 'a's (minimal possible), then check if all k letters are present. If yes, then that's the lex smallest possible.

But this may not work, since the remaining pairs may not be sufficient to cover all missing letters.

Hmm.

Let me take an example.

Suppose k=3, initial string after processing is "aaaa". Missing letters are 'b', 'c'.

Now, process pairs from the end:

First pair is (1,2) (indices in 0-based for length 4). Current char is 'a'.

Possible higher chars are 'b' and 'c'.

Try replacing with 'b's. Then the string becomes "abba". Missing letters are 'c'.

Now, the remaining pairs are (0,3). Replace them with 'a's (as before). So the string is "abba". Still missing 'c'.

So this approach doesn't work.

Next, try replacing the pair (1,2) with 'c's. Now the string is "acca". Missing 'b'. Then check the remaining pair (0,3) which is 'a's. Replacing them with 'b's gives "bccb". Now missing 'a' (since 'a's were replaced with 'b's). So that's invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps after replacing a pair, we have to check the entire string (including the rest filled with minimal chars) to see if all letters are present.

But in this case, after replacing (1,2) with 'b's, the string is "abba". Then the remaining pair (0,3) are 'a's. So letters are 'a' and 'b'. Still missing 'c'. So no.

Thus, this approach doesn't work.

So perhaps, in cases where multiple letters are missing, we need to find a way to cover all missing letters by replacing pairs.

In such cases, perhaps the number of pairs available is less than the number of missing letters, making it impossible.

But how to check that.

For example, if k=3 and the initial string after processing is "aaaa", missing 'b', 'c', and 'd' (but k=3 is allowed letters a, b, c?), no, that's not possible. Wait, k=3 allows a, b, c.

But the initial processing would have set all pairs to 'a's, so letters present are 'a'. So missing 'b' and 'c'. So m=2. If there's only one pair available, then it's impossible to add both 'b' and 'c'.

Thus, in this case, it's impossible.

Thus, the code must also check if the number of available pairs (i.e., the number of pairs that were originally '?') is sufficient to cover the missing letters.

So the algorithm would need to:

- After initial processing, compute the number of available pairs (count_pairs) that can be modified (i.e., those pairs that were originally '?' and were set to 'a').

- If the number of missing letters (m) is greater than count_pairs, output IMPOSSIBLE.

- Else, for each of the m missing letters, replace a pair with that letter.

But the question is, how to choose which pairs to replace with which letters to ensure that the lex order is minimal.

For example, in the case where missing 'b' and 'c', and two pairs are available, the best approach is to replace the rightmost pair with 'b' and the next pair with 'c', but in reverse order? Or the other way around?

Wait, the lex smallest string would be the one where the earliest possible pairs are as small as possible. So replacing the rightmost pair with 'c' and the next pair with 'b' would result in a string like "abba" (if there are two pairs). Wait, no. Let's see:

Suppose initial string is "aaaa", two pairs (0,3) and (1,2). Missing letters 'b' and 'c'.

If we replace the rightmost pair (1,2) with 'c's, then the string becomes "acca". Then replace pair (0,3) with 'b's, making "bccb". But this has letters 'b' and 'c', missing 'a' (but the initial 'a's were replaced). So this is invalid.

Alternatively, replace pair (1,2) with 'b's (abba) and pair (0,3) with 'c's (cbbc). Now, letters are 'b' and 'c' again. Still missing 'a'.

Ah, but the initial letters are replaced. So this approach is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps the correct way is to first replace pairs with the highest possible missing letters first, to ensure that the lower ones can be added by other pairs. But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the only way to have all k letters present is to have at least one occurrence of each of the k letters. So after replacing the pairs, we need to ensure that all k letters are present.

But how to ensure that when replacing pairs.

Let me think of a new approach.

After initial processing:

- The string is a palindrome, but may be missing some required letters.

- We need to adjust some pairs to include the missing letters.

- Each pair must be set to a character that is allowed (one of the first k letters).

- The goal is to make the string lex smallest possible.

Thus, the problem is to find the lex smallest palindrome which contains all k letters, and satisfies the initial template.

So the approach is to generate all possible lex minimal palindromes that include all k letters and choose the smallest one.

But how to generate this efficiently.

Alternative approach:

1. Generate the initial palindrome (as per steps before).

2. Check if it contains all k letters. If yes, return it.

3. Else, find all possible ways to adjust pairs of 'a's (from the initial processing) to higher letters, starting from the end.

4. For each possible adjustment, check if the resulting string contains all k letters.

5. Among all such valid strings, choose the lex smallest one.

But this could be implemented via backtracking or greedy approach.

But for a string of length up to 100, this may be feasible.

But how to implement this.

Alternatively, the code can iterate over each pair from right to left, and for each possible character c (from 'a' to the k-th letter, and higher than the current character of the pair), replace the pair with c, and check if after replacing all pairs to the right (earlier pairs) with 'a's (the minimal possible), the string contains all k letters.

If such a replacement is found, then this would be the lex smallest possible.

For example, in the sample input 2:

Initial string after processing: "aaaa".

Check if all 2 letters are present: no, missing 'b'.

Now, iterate pairs from right to left:

First, pair (1,2) (current 'a's). Possible c is 'b'.

Replace them with 'b's. Now the string is "abba".

Check if 'a' and 'b' are present. Yes. So output "abba".

Thus, this approach works.

Another example: initial string "aaaa", k=3. Missing 'b' and 'c'.

Iterate pairs from right to left:

Pair (1,2) can be replaced with 'b's: resulting string "abba". Check if all letters are present: 'a' and 'b' → missing 'c'. Not valid.

Next possible c for this pair is 'c'. Replace with 'c's: "acca". Check letters: 'a' and 'c' → missing 'b'. Not valid.

Next pair (0,3). Current 'a's. Replace with 'b's: "baab". Check letters: 'a' and 'b' → missing 'c'. Not valid.

Replace with 'c's: "caac". Letters: 'a' and 'c' → missing 'b'. Not valid.

Thus, no valid solution.

Thus, output is IMPOSSIBLE.

But in reality, if there are two pairs available, we need to replace them with 'b' and 'c'.

But how to find such a combination.

But the code would need to find a way to replace pairs with different letters.

This suggests that the approach of replacing pairs from right to left, trying all possible higher characters, and checking if the resulting string includes all letters.

But this can be computationally feasible, given the small input size.

So here's the plan:

After initial processing, if the string is a palindrome but missing some letters:

   For each pair in reverse order (starting from the last pair towards the first):

      For each possible character c in the allowed letters, greater than the current character:

         create a new string where this pair is set to c, and all pairs to the right (i.e., with higher indices) are set to 'a's (or the minimal possible).

         check if this new string contains all k letters.

         if yes, then return the lex smallest such string found.

   If no such string is found after all pairs are checked, output IMPOSSIBLE.

But wait, why set the pairs to the right to 'a's? Because after changing the current pair to a higher character, the pairs to the right (which are after this pair) would have been processed later (since we are iterating from the end). So when we change a pair to a higher character, the pairs to the right (earlier in the iteration) can be set to 'a's to minimize the lex order.

This way, the current pair is set to the smallest possible higher character that allows the rest of the pairs to be as small as possible.

But how to implement this.

For example:

current string is "aaaa" (k=3, missing 'b' and 'c').

We iterate pair (1,2) first.

For c in 'b', 'c':

   new string is "abba" (c='b'). Now, check if all letters are present. No.

   new string is "acca" (c='c'). Check again. No.

Next, iterate pair (0,3):

   replace with 'b's → "baab". Check. Letters 'a' and 'b'. No.

   replace with 'c's → "caac". Letters 'a' and 'c'. No.

Thus, no solution.

But if there are two pairs, like in a string of length 6:

original template "??????", k=3.

Initial processing gives "aaaaaa" (all pairs set to 'a's). Missing 'b' and 'c'.

We need to replace two pairs.

So the code would:

Iterate from the last pair (positions 2 and 3).

Try replacing with 'b's → "aabbaa". Letters 'a' and 'b' → missing 'c'. Not valid.

Then try replacing with 'c's → "aaccaa". Letters 'a' and 'c' → missing 'b'. Not valid.

Then move to the next pair (positions 1 and 4). Current 'a's.

Replace with 'b's → "abbaaa". Wait, no. Wait, the pairs are processed from the end towards the start.

Wait, for length 6, the pairs are (0,5), (1,4), (2,3).

So when processing pair (2,3) first, then (1,4), then (0,5).

When we process pair (2,3) and replace with 'b's, the string becomes "aabbaa". Then, the pairs to the right (none in this case) are set to 'a's (but since we're processing pairs from the end, after pair (2,3), the next pair is (1,4).

But in the code's approach, when replacing pair (2,3) with 'b's, the pairs to the right (none here) are set to 'a's. So no change.

Then, after replacing, we check if all letters are present. If not, proceed to the next pair.

But in the case of two pairs, perhaps we need to replace both.

But how to code this.

Alternatively, the code can iterate through all possible pairs and possible replacements, and for each replacement, check if the resulting string has all letters.

But with n=100, this could be up to 50 pairs, and for each pair, up to 26 possible replacements. Which is 50*26=1300 possibilities, which is manageable.

But for each possibility, we need to generate the string and check for all k letters.

But how to generate the string.

Thus, the steps in code:

After initial processing, and checking if all letters are present:

If not, for each pair in reverse order (from end to start):

   For each possible c in allowed letters (sorted in ascending order), where c > current character:

      new_str = initial_str processed to replace this pair with c, and all pairs to the right (earlier pairs in reverse order) are set to 'a's.

      check if new_str contains all k letters.

      if yes, return new_str.

Thus, for each pair, when we replace it with c, we also replace all pairs to the right (which are earlier in the iteration order) with 'a's. This ensures that the lex order is as small as possible.

But how to generate new_str.

Example:

Initial_str is "aaaa".

Pairs are (0,3) and (1,2).

Processing pair (1,2) first.

Trying c='b':

Replace pair (1,2) with 'b's → "abba".

Check if all letters are present. If yes, return.

In sample input 2, this works.

Another example:

Initial_str is "aaaa" (k=3).

For pair (1,2), trying c='b' gives "abba". Still missing 'c'.

Then trying c='c' gives "acca". Still missing 'b'.

Proceed to pair (0,3):

Trying c='b' gives "baab". Missing 'c'.

Trying c='c' gives "caac". Missing 'b'.

No solution.

Thus, code returns IMPOSSIBLE.

Thus, the code would proceed as follows:

- For each pair in reverse order:

   For each possible c in allowed letters, in ascending order:

      if c > current_char:

          create a new string where:

              this pair is set to c.

              all pairs to the right (processed earlier) are set to 'a's.

          check if this new string has all k letters.

          if yes, return this new string.

Thus, the code would try the smallest possible c first (to find the lex smallest solution).

Once a valid solution is found, return it.

If no solution after all iterations, output IMPOSSIBLE.

But how to implement this.

To implement this, the code can:

For each pair in reverse order:

   i is the current index (from (n//2 -1) downto 0):

   for each c in range(ord(current_char) +1, ord('a') +k):

      c_char = chr(c)

      create a new string where:

          for this pair (i, mirror_i), set to c_char.

          for all pairs processed after this pair (those with higher indices), set to 'a's.

          but since we are iterating from the end, perhaps the pairs processed after are those with higher indices?

Wait, in reverse order, the first pair processed is the last pair (rightmost). So when processing a pair, the pairs that come after it (in the iteration order) are those that are further to the left. So when a pair is processed, any pairs to the right (earlier in the string) are not yet processed. So when replacing this pair, the pairs to the right (earlier) may have been set to 'a's.

Wait, perhaps the code needs to:

When processing a pair (i, mirror_i) in reverse order (from end to start):

   For this pair, try replacing it with c (c > current_char).

   Then, for all pairs that are processed after this pair (i.e., pairs with lower indices than i, which are processed later in the reverse order), set them to 'a's.

But this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps when we process pair i, all pairs with higher indices (processed earlier in the reverse order) are set to 'a's.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can process each pair in reverse order, and for each possible c, create a new candidate string where:

   - the current pair is set to c.

   - all pairs that are processed after this pair (i.e., pairs with higher indices in the original order) are set to 'a's.

But how to track which pairs are processed after.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can process the pairs in reverse order (from the last pair to the first), and for each pair, when considering replacing it with c, set all pairs to the right of it (earlier pairs in the reverse order) to 'a's.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, when processing a pair (i, mirror_i) in reverse order (i from n//2 -1 downto 0), the pairs that have been processed before this pair are those with higher i. So when this pair is processed, the pairs processed after this (i.e., lower i) are not yet processed. So when we replace this pair with c, the pairs to the left (lower i) can be set to 'a's.

But how to track that.

Perhaps the code can:

For a given candidate pair (i, mirror_i), when replacing it with c, we can generate a new string as follows:

   copy the current string.

   replace the pair (i, mirror_i) with c.

   for all pairs j where j > i (i.e., pairs to the left of i in the original order), set them to 'a's.

Wait, no. The pairs are processed in reverse order, so j > i would be pairs processed earlier. For example, for n=4, pairs are (0,3), (1,2). Reverse order is (1,2), then (0,3). So when processing pair (1,2), j > i (i=1) is j=0.

So when replacing pair (1,2) with c, the code should set pairs j > i (which in reverse order is pair (0,3)) to 'a's.

Thus, when generating the new string, after setting pair (i, mirror_i) to c, all pairs with j > i (i.e., processed after this pair in the original order) are set to 'a's.

But how to implement this.

So the code would:

For each i from (n//2-1) downto 0:

   for each possible c > current_char:

      new_str = initial_str.copy()

      new_str[i] = c

      new_str[mirror_i] = c

      for j in range(i+1, n//2):

          new_j = j

          new_mirror_j = len(new_str) -1 -j

          new_str[new_j] = 'a'

          new_str[new_mirror_j] = 'a'

      check if new_str contains all k letters.

      if yes, return new_str.

But this seems manageable.

But in code, how to generate new_str.

In Python, strings are immutable, so we can convert the string to a list.

Thus, steps:

After initial processing, if missing letters:

   for i in range(len(pairs)-1, -1, -1):

      current_char = s_list[i]

      if current_char == 'a' + k-1:  # already the maximum possible char, can't increase.

          continue

      for c_ord in range(ord(current_char) +1, ord('a') +k):

          c = chr(c_ord)

          new_s = s_list.copy()

          # replace current pair with c.

          new_s[i] = c

          new_s[mirror_i] = c

          # replace all pairs to the right (j > i) with 'a's.

          for j in range(i+1, len(pairs)):

              j_pos = j

              j_mirror = len(new_s) -1 -j_pos

              new_s[j_pos] = 'a'

              new_s[j_mirror] = 'a'

          # check if this new_s has all k letters.

          # count the present letters.

          present = set(new_s)

          if len(present) == k and all(chr(ord('a') + m) in present for m in range(k)):

              # check if this new_s is a palindrome.

              # since we replaced pairs, it's guaranteed to be a palindrome.

              # output the new_s.

              return ''.join(new_s)

   # after all pairs processed, no solution.

   return "IMPOSSIBLE"

This approach seems feasible.

Thus, the steps in code are:

1. Check if the original template can form a palindrome. If not, return IMPOSSIBLE.

2. Process the template into a palindrome by replacing '?'s as per the rules.

3. Check if the resulting string contains all k letters. If yes, return it.

4. Else, for each pair in reverse order, try replacing it with higher letters, resetting the pairs to the right (earlier in reverse order) to 'a's, and check if all k letters are present.

5. If found, return the string. Else, return IMPOSSIBLE.

Now, implementing this.

But first, processing the initial template to form a palindrome.

To process the initial template:

for i in range( (n+1)//2 ):

   mirror_i = n-1 -i

   if s_list[i] == '?' and s_list[mirror_i] == '?':

       s_list[i] = 'a'

       s_list[mirror_i] = 'a'

   elif s_list[i] == '?':

       s_list[i] = s_list[mirror_i]

   elif s_list[mirror_i] == '?':

       s_list[mirror_i] = s_list[i]

   else:

       if s_list[i] != s_list[mirror_i]:

           return "IMPOSSIBLE"

Thus, this step ensures that the processed string is a palindrome.

Then, check if all k letters are present.

If not, proceed to the adjustment steps.

Thus, the code outline is:

k = int(input())

s = input().strip()

n = len(s)

s_list = list(s)

possible = True

for i in range( (n+1)//2 ):

    mirror_i = n-1 -i

    a = s_list[i]

    b = s_list[mirror_i]

    if a == '?' and b == '?':

        s_list[i] = 'a'

        s_list[mirror_i] = 'a'

    elif a == '?':

        s_list[i] = b

    elif b == '?':

        s_list[mirror_i] = a

    else:

        if a != b:

            possible = False

            break

if not possible:

    print("IMPOSSIBLE")

else:

    # Now, check if all k letters are present.

    present = set()

    for c in s_list:

        present.add(c)

    required = set( [ chr(ord('a') + i) for i in range(k) ] )

    if present.issuperset(required):

        print(''.join(s_list))

        exit()

    # Else, try to adjust.

    # Iterate pairs in reverse order.

    # Find all pairs (i, mirror_i) that can be increased.

    for i in range( (n//2)-1, -1, -1 ):

        mirror_i = n-1 -i

        current_char = s_list[i]

        # Allowed characters are 'a' to 'a' + k-1.

        max_char = ord('a') + k -1

        if ord(current_char) >= max_char:

            continue  # can't increase.

        for c_ord in range(ord(current_char)+1, max_char +1):

            c = chr(c_ord)

            new_s = s_list.copy()

            new_s[i] = c

            new_s[mirror_i] = c

            # Replace all pairs to the right (j > i) with 'a's.

            # j ranges from i+1 to (n//2 -1)

            for j in range(i+1, (n//2) ):

                j_mirror = n-1 -j

                new_s[j] = 'a'

                new_s[j_mirror] = 'a'

            # Check if all k letters are present.

            new_present = set(new_s)

            if new_present.issuperset(required):

                # Check if it's a palindrome.

                # Since we replaced pairs, it should be.

                print(''.join(new_s))

                exit()

    print("IMPOSSIBLE")

Wait, but in the code above, after replacing the current pair and the pairs to the right (j > i) with 'a's, what about the pairs that are not in the initial processing? For example, pairs that were not '?' and were set to some other character.

But no, because in the initial processing, the code replaces all '?'s into characters, ensuring that the string is a palindrome. So when the code tries to adjust pairs, the new_s is a copy of the initial processed string. So all pairs are already set to valid characters, and replacing them with 'a's or other letters is allowed, as long as the new string remains a palindrome.

Wait, but when we replace pair j (i+1 <= j < (n//2)), and their mirrors, with 'a's, this maintains the palindrome property.

Yes.

Thus, the code should work.

Testing the sample inputs.

Sample input 2:

2

a??a

Initial processing:

The string is "a??a".

Processing pair 0 and 3:

s_list[0] is 'a', s_list[3] is 'a' → OK.

Pair 1 and 2: both '?', so set to 'a's.

Resulting string: "aaaa".

Check if all 2 letters are present: no, missing 'b'.

Then, iterate pairs in reverse order (pair 1 and 2).

Current_char is 'a'.

Possible c_ord is 98 ('b').

Replace pair 1 and 2 with 'b's. Then, pairs to the right (j > 1) are none. So new_s becomes "abba".

Check if all letters are present: 'a' and 'b' → yes. So output "abba".

Sample input 3:

2

?b?a

Initial processing:

Original string is "?b?a".

Pair 0 and 3: '?' and 'a'.

So s_list[0] is set to 'a', s_list[3] is 'a'.

Pair 1 and 2: 'b' and '?'.

So s_list[2] is set to 'b'.

Resulting string is "abba".

Check if all letters are present: yes. So output "abba".

Sample input 1:

3

a?c.

Processing:

The string is "a?c".

Mirror positions: 0 and 2.

s[0] is 'a', s[2] is 'c' → they are different. So output IMPOSSIBLE.

Another test case:

k=3, s= "a???a".

Initial processing:

Length 5. Middle character (index 2) is '?'. When processing pair 0 and 4: 'a' and 'a'. OK.

Pair 1 and 3: '?', '?'. Set to 'a's. Middle character (index 2) is '?', which is processed as a single character (since n is odd). Set to 'a'.

Resulting string is "aaaaa". Missing 'b' and 'c'.

Adjusting:

Iterate pairs in reverse order (pair 2 is the middle character, but in the code, the loop is for i in range( (n//2)-1, -1, -1 )). For n=5, (n//2) is 2. So (n//2)-1 = 1. So the loop runs for i=1 downto 0.

Pair 1 and 3 (indices 1 and 3) are 'a's.

Replace with 'b's. Then set pair 0 and 4 to 'a's.

New string is "abaa a" → "abbaa" (assuming middle is 'a').

Check present letters: 'a', 'b' → missing 'c'.

Then replace pair 1 and 3 with 'c's → "acaaa" (pair 0 and 4 are 'a's). Check: 'a', 'c' → missing 'b'.

Then process pair 0 and 4 (i=0). Replace with 'b's → "baaaab" (length 5? No, original length is 5. Index 0 and 4 are 'b's. Middle is 'a'. So string is "baaab". Check letters: 'a' and 'b' → missing 'c'.

No solution.

Thus, output IMPOSSIBLE.

Thus, the code works.

Thus, the final code should handle all cases.
