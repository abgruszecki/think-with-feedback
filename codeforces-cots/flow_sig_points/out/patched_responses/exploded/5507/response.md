Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.

The problem says that there are two languages. Each word in the first language (ai) has a corresponding word in the second language (bi). The goal is to process the lecture notes by replacing each word with the shorter of the two corresponding words. If they are the same length, choose the first language's word.

So the steps are:

1. For each word in the lecture (which is in the first language), find its corresponding word in the second language.
2. Compare the lengths of ai and bi. Choose the shorter one. If equal, choose ai.
3. Output the chosen words in order.

First, I need to map each ai to bi, and also each bi to ai, but since the lecture words are all from ai, maybe I don't need the reverse. Wait, no. Because the input lecture is all in the first language. The problem states: each ci is in the set of a1..am. So each ci is an ai. So for each ci, we need to find its corresponding bi, then compare lengths.

So the plan is:

- Create a dictionary (hash map) that maps each ai to its corresponding bi.
- For each word in the lecture, look up the bi.
- Compare lengths of ai (the original word) and bi. If the length of ai is less than bi's, choose ai. If equal, choose ai. Otherwise, choose bi.

Wait, the problem says: "you write down each word in the language in which the word is shorter". So for each word in the lecture (which is ai), the alternative is bi. So for each ai in the lecture, compare len(ai) vs len(bi). If len(bi) is shorter, use bi; else, use ai. But in case of equal lengths, use ai.

So the steps are:

1. Read m pairs of words. For each pair, build a map from ai to bi.
2. For each word in the lecture (all ai's), look up the corresponding bi.
3. For each ai in lecture, decide between ai and bi based on their lengths.

So the main data structure needed is a dictionary that maps each ai to bi. Then, for processing the lecture words, it's a simple lookup and comparison.

Now, considering the constraints. The input m can be up to 3000, which is manageable. For each of the n (up to 3000) lecture words, we need a hash table lookup, which is O(1), so total time is O(n), which is acceptable.

Regarding memory, each word is up to 10 characters. Storing a dictionary with 3000 entries is no problem.

So the steps to code:

- Read n and m.
- Read m lines, each with ai and bi. Store them in a dictionary, say a_to_b, where a_to_b[ai] = bi.
- Read the next line, split into the lecture words (ci's).
- For each ci in the lecture:
   - Get bi = a_to_b[ci]
   - if len(ci) < len(bi): choose ci
   - else if len(ci) > len(bi): choose bi
   - else: choose ci (since same length, prefer first language)
- Collect all these choices into a list and output them space-separated.

Edge cases to test:

- All words in lecture have corresponding bi that are shorter. Then output all bi's.
- All ai are same length as bi. Output ai's.
- Mixture of cases.

Let me test with the first example input:

Input:
4 3
codeforces codesecrof
contest round
letter message
codeforces contest letter contest

The lecture words are codeforces, contest, letter, contest.

For codeforces: ai is codeforces (10 letters), bi is codesecrof (10 letters). Wait, wait, the example output shows codeforces. But according to the code, since lengths are equal, choose ai. So yes, the first word is codeforces.

contest's bi is round. ai is contest (7 letters), bi is round (5 letters). Since 7>5, choose round. So in the output, contest becomes round.

letter's bi is message. letter is 6, message is 7. So choose letter.

The fourth word is contest again, same as before, becomes round.

So output is codeforces round letter round. Which matches the example.

Another example:

Input:
5 3
joll wuqrd
euzf un
hbnyiyc rsoqqveh
hbnyiyc joll joll euzf joll

The lecture words are hbnyiyc, joll, joll, euzf, joll.

Looking up each:

hbnyiyc's bi is rsoqqveh. len(hbnyiyc) is 7, bi is 8. So choose hbnyiyc.

joll's bi is wuqrd. len(joll) is 4, bi is 5. So choose joll.

euzf's bi is un. len(euzf) is 4, bi is 2. So choose un.

So the output is hbnyiyc joll joll un joll. Which matches the example.

So the code seems to handle these cases.

Now, for the implementation.

In Python, reading input. The first line is n and m.

Then m lines follow, each with ai and bi. We can create a dictionary, say word_map = {}, and for each line, add word_map[ai] = bi.

Then, read the next line, split into parts.

For each part in the lecture:

current_ai = part
bi = word_map[current_ai]

Compare len(current_ai) and len(bi). If len(current_ai) <= len(bi): choose current_ai, else bi.

So the code would be something like:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, m = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    word_map = {}
    for _ in range(m):
        a, b = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()
        word_map[a] = b
    lecture = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()
    result = []
    for word in lecture:
        b = word_map[word]
        if len(word) <= len(b):
            result.append(word)
        else:
            result.append(b)
    print(' '.join(result), file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
5 3
joll wuqrd
euzf un
hbnyiyc rsoqqveh
hbnyiyc joll joll euzf joll
""",
            "output": \
"""\
hbnyiyc joll joll un joll
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

The code seems straightforward and efficient. The time is O(m + n) for processing, which is acceptable for m and n up to 3000. The space is O(m) for the dictionary, which is also acceptable.

So this should be the correct solution.

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a_to_b = {}
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = input().split()
    a_to_b[a] = b
lecture = input().split()
output = []
for word in lecture:
    b = a_to_b[word]
    if len(word) <= len(b):
        output.append(word)
    else:
        output.append(b)
print(' '.join(output))
```
