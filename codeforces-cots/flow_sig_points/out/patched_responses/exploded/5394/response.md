Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the minimum number of strings from the given set that Stepan needs to concatenate such that the favorite string s is a subsequence of the concatenated result. If it's not possible, we return -1.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. A subsequence means that the characters of s appear in order, but not necessarily consecutively. So, for each character in s, we need to find it in the concatenated strings in the correct order.

Let me think about the approach. The key here is to model how each string from the set can help us progress through the characters of s. The goal is to use as few strings as possible. So, for each step, we want to choose a string that allows us to cover as much of s as possible.

Here's an idea: For each position in s, track the current index we're trying to match. Then, iterate through the available strings and determine how far each string can advance this index. We want to pick the string that gives the maximum advancement. If after using a string the index hasn't advanced, that's a problem. But if each string can contribute some progress, this would minimize the count.

Wait, but how do we model this efficiently?

Let me think of it as a greedy approach. At any step, we want to select the string from the set that allows us to cover the most remaining characters of s. However, the problem is that the optimal choice might not be the immediately best one. For example, choosing a string that covers a little now but allows a bigger jump later. But greedy approaches can sometimes fail here. However, given the constraints (like the size of s up to 2500), perhaps a dynamic programming approach would be feasible.

Alternatively, we can model the problem as a state transition, where the state is the current position in s (i.e., how many characters of s have been matched so far). For each state, we can try all possible strings and see which one takes us the farthest. Then, we choose the one with the minimum steps.

Yes, this seems like a BFS approach. Each state is the current position in s (let's say pos). For each state, we can try all the available strings. For each string, we calculate how many characters of s starting from pos can be matched by this string. The new state would be pos + the number of matched characters. We want to find the minimum number of steps (strings used) to reach pos equal to the length of s.

But how do we compute, for a given string and a starting position, how many characters of s can be matched?

For example, suppose the current position in s is pos. Then, for a given string t, we can find the maximum number of characters in s that can be matched starting at pos when we process t. Let's call this function f(pos, t) which returns the maximum number of characters we can advance.

The way to compute f(pos, t) is similar to a two-pointer approach. We start at pos in s and at the beginning of t. For each character in t, if it matches s[pos], we advance pos by 1. We continue until we reach the end of t. The total advancement is pos_new - pos_initial. So this gives the maximum possible progress for t starting from a given pos.

Once we have this function, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from pos=0 to pos=len(s), where each edge represents using a string and moving forward by some number of positions.

This sounds manageable. Let's outline the steps:

1. Preprocessing: For each string in the set, precompute for each possible position in s (from 0 to len(s)-1) how much advancement the string can provide. Also, check if any characters in s are not present in the union of the set's strings. If such a character exists, the answer is immediately -1.

Wait, yes! If s contains a character that none of the set's strings have, then it's impossible. So first, we need to check this. For example, in the third test case, there's a 'c' which isn't in any of the strings, so output is -1.

So first step: check that all characters in s are present in at least one of the set's strings. If not, output -1.

Otherwise, proceed.

Next, model the problem as a BFS where each state is the current position in s. We want to reach len(s) with the least steps (strings used).

Each state (pos) can transition to pos + f(pos, t) for each t in the set. The edge weight is 1 (since each t counts as one string used).

We can use BFS to find the minimum number of steps, as BFS explores states in order of their distance (number of steps). So the first time we reach len(s) is the minimum steps required.

But the problem is that the size of s can be up to 2500. So the number of possible states is 2501 (from 0 to len(s)), which is manageable. For each state, we process all possible strings (n up to 50), so total operations are 2500 * 50 = 125,000, which is acceptable for Python's speed.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute for each string in the set, for each possible pos in s, compute the maximum advancement possible. Store this as a lookup table.

2. Check if all characters in s are covered by the set's strings. If not, return -1.

3. Use BFS (or BFS-based approach) to find the minimal number of steps (strings used) to reach len(s). The steps are the count of strings used.

Now, let's think about how to implement this.

First, checking for the presence of all characters in s.

We can collect all characters present in the set's strings. Then, check if each character in s is in this set. If any is missing, return -1.

But how to collect all characters in the set's strings?

Just iterate through each string in the set and add all their characters to a set. Then, for s, check each character.

Next, for the function f(pos, t), which for a given pos and string t, returns the number of characters of s that can be matched starting from pos.

We can compute this as follows:

Initialize current_pos = pos. For each character in t:

   if current_pos < len(s) and t_char == s[current_pos], then current_pos += 1.

The advancement is current_pos - pos.

We can precompute this for all possible pos and all strings in the set.

But with s up to 2500 in length, and each string up to 50 in length, and n up to 50, the precomputation would take O(n * len(s) * len(t)) time. For n=50, len(s)=2500, and len(t)=50, that's 50 * 2500 * 50 = 6,250,000 operations. That's acceptable.

So precompute a 2D array where advance[i][j] is the number of characters advanced when using string j (from the set) at position i in s.

Alternatively, for each string in the set, precompute a dictionary or list that maps pos to the advancement.

So for each string t in the set, precompute a list where for each pos in s, the value is the maximum advancement possible when using t starting at pos.

Once this precomputation is done, the BFS can proceed efficiently.

Now, for the BFS:

We can represent the state as the current position in s (pos). We start at pos 0 with a count of 0 (zero strings used). For each state (pos, count), we explore all possible transitions by using each string in the set, leading to new states (pos + advance[pos][t], count + 1). We need to track the minimal count for each pos to avoid revisiting it with a higher count.

We can use a BFS queue, and a distance array (or dictionary) that keeps track of the minimum number of steps needed to reach each pos. Initially, distance[0] = 0. For each pos dequeued, we process each string in the set, compute the new_pos (pos + advance[pos][t]), and if new_pos is greater than the current len(s), cap it at len(s). Then, if the new_pos's current distance is not yet set, or is higher than the current count +1, we update it and add it to the queue.

This is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, but since all edges have the same weight (each step adds 1), BFS suffices as we process states in order of their count. So BFS will naturally find the shortest path (minimum count) first.

So the steps in code would be:

- Read n, then the n strings (possibly with duplicates, but they are treated as separate entries? Wait, no. The problem says that each string from the set can be used multiple times. So even if two strings are the same, each counts as a possible option. So if the same string is present multiple times in the input, using it multiple times is allowed, but since they are the same, their effect is the same. However, since the problem allows using a string multiple times, even if it's present once in the input, but in the code, the same string can be reused as needed.

Wait, the problem says: "It is possible that some strings from Stepan's set are the same." So the input may have duplicates, but the code can use the same string multiple times, regardless of how many times it's present in the input. So in the code, all n strings are considered as available options, even if duplicates. So for example, if the input has two "a" strings, then each can be chosen, but since they are same, using either gives the same effect. But for BFS, trying all n strings each time is necessary, even if some are duplicates, because perhaps a different string (even if same) allows the same advancement. But since the code is trying all possible options, even duplicates, but in reality, using the same string again would have the same effect. So precomputing the advancement for each string (including duplicates) is correct.

But perhaps we can optimize by grouping duplicate strings. For example, for a given pos, if two strings have the same advancement, using either gives the same result. So perhaps deduplicating the strings (grouping identical strings) and then precomputing their advancement once. But in practice, since n is up to 50, processing all 50 strings each time isn't a problem.

So, for the code:

- Read the n strings. Store them in a list. Even if duplicates are present, they are kept as separate entries.

Now, precompute for each string in the list, a list of advancements for each possible pos in s.

Then, the BFS:

Initialize a distance array of size len(s)+1. Set all to -1. Set distance[0] = 0. Use a deque. Enqueue 0.

While the deque is not empty:

   pos = deque.popleft()

   for each string in the set:

      advancement = precomputed_advancements[string_index][pos]

      new_pos = pos + advancement

      if new_pos >= len(s):

          return distance[pos] + 1

      if new_pos > pos:

          if distance[new_pos] == -1 or distance[new_pos] > distance[pos] + 1:

              distance[new_pos] = distance[pos] + 1

              append new_pos to the deque.

Wait, no. Because if new_pos is not len(s), we have to continue. So the code must process all possibilities until it reaches len(s).

Wait, but the BFS approach would process the pos in order of their count (number of steps). So the first time we reach len(s), we can return the count.

But how to check if new_pos is len(s) in the BFS.

Wait, for example:

If pos is len(s) - x, and after applying the string, the advancement is x, then new_pos becomes len(s), which is the target.

So in code:

Each time, after computing new_pos as pos + advancement, check if new_pos >= len(s). If so, then the answer is the current count + 1.

But how to handle this in BFS.

So, during the BFS, whenever we process a pos, for each string, compute new_pos. If new_pos >= len(s), then we can immediately return distance[pos] + 1, since that's the minimal count.

But in the BFS, since we process the states in order of their count (since BFS is level order traversal), the first time we encounter a new_pos that's >= len(s), that's the minimal count. So yes, once any such new_pos is found, return the count +1.

Thus, the code can be structured as follows:

Initialize a queue with pos 0. For each pos in the queue, check all strings. For each, compute new_pos. If new_pos >= len(s), return current count +1. Otherwise, if new_pos hasn't been visited yet, or can be reached in fewer steps, update and enqueue.

But how to track the count. The distance array can store the minimal steps to reach each pos. So when processing a pos with distance[pos], trying a string would give new_pos, and the steps would be distance[pos] +1. If new_pos is len(s), return distance[pos] +1.

So the algorithm steps:

Check for presence of all s's characters.

If not, return -1.

Else, precompute the advancement for each string and pos.

Initialize distance as array of size len(s)+1, filled with infinity (like a large number), except distance[0] = 0.

Use a deque for BFS. Enqueue pos 0.

While the deque is not empty:

   pos = deque.popleft()

   current_steps = distance[pos]

   for each string in the set:

      adv = precomputed_advancements[string][pos]

      new_pos = pos + adv

      if new_pos >= len(s):

          return current_steps + 1

      if new_pos > pos and distance[new_pos] > current_steps + 1:

          distance[new_pos] = current_steps + 1

          deque.append(new_pos)

If after processing all possibilities, len(s) is not reached, return -1.

Wait, but how can that happen? Because earlier we checked that all characters are present. But even if all characters are present, perhaps the order is such that the sequence can't be formed. For example, if s is "ab", and the set has a string "ba". Then using the string "ba" once would give "ba", which has "a" after "b", so subsequence "ab" isn't present. But the code would see that the advancement for pos 0 (using "ba") is 1 (since 'b' is first, which doesn't match s[0] = 'a', so advancement is 0. Then in pos 0, using "ba" again, but perhaps that's not helpful. Wait, this example is conflicting with the initial check. Wait, in this case, s is "ab", which has 'a' and 'b', both present in the set (since the set has "ba"). So the initial check passes, but it's impossible to form the subsequence. So the code's BFS would process pos 0, and for each string, compute adv.

So in the example where s is "ab", and the set has "ba", let's compute the advancement for pos 0.

Processing "ba":

pos is 0. s[0] is 'a'.

We iterate through the characters of "ba". The first character is 'b', which doesn't match s[0]. Then next is 'a' which matches. So current_pos becomes 1. So the advancement is 1.

So using "ba" at pos 0 gives new_pos = 1. Then, we process pos 1. For each string again.

Processing "ba" again. Now, pos is 1 (s[1] is 'b'). The string "ba" has 'b' first. So current_pos starts at 1. 'b' matches s[1], so current_pos becomes 2. Then the 'a' is next, but current_pos is 2 (which is len(s) is 2, so we can't go further. So the advancement for "ba" at pos 1 is 1 (current_pos +1 - pos 1 is 1). So new_pos is 2, which is equal to len(s). So the code would return current_steps (which was 1) + 1 = 2. But the correct answer is impossible. Wait, wait, no. Because the concatenated strings would be "ba" + "ba" = "baba". The subsequence "ab" would be formed by taking the 'a' from the first "ba" (position 1) and the 'b' from the second "ba" (position 2). So the answer is 2. So code's output would be correct. But according to the problem's conditions, is "ab" a subsequence of "baba"?

Yes. The first 'a' is at index 1, and the next 'b' is at index 2. So the code would correctly return 2. But the initial check would have allowed it, which is correct.

So the code handles such cases correctly.

Another example: s is "ab", set has "a" and "b". Then code can find the minimal steps.

But what if the set has only "a" but s is "aa"? Then the code would process using "a" twice.

But I think the code is correct.

Now, let's think about how to precompute the advancement for each string and pos.

For each string t in the set:

   for each pos in 0 ... len(s)-1:

      compute the maximum number of characters matched when t is processed.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Implement the two-pointer approach: for a given pos, iterate through the characters of t and see how much of s can be covered starting from pos.

So for pos in 0 to len(s):

   current = pos

   for c in t:

       if current < len(s) and c == s[current]:

           current += 1

   advancement = current - pos

So this can be computed for each t and pos.

So, in Python code:

precompute a list of lists. For each t in the set, create a list where the index is pos, and the value is the advancement.

Once this is done, the BFS can proceed.

Now, let's code this step by step.

First, check for all characters in s present in the set.

set_chars = set()

for t in set_strings:

    set_chars.update(t)

if any(c not in set_chars for c in s):

    print(-1)

else:

    proceed.

Then, precompute the advancements:

advancements = []

for t in set_strings:

    t_adv = [0]*(len(s)+1)  # since pos can be 0 to len(s) (inclusive?)

    for pos in range(len(s)+1):  # maybe pos can be up to len(s) (e.g., pos is len(s) means 0 advancement)

        current = pos

        for c in t:

            if current < len(s) and c == s[current]:

                current +=1

        t_adv[pos] = current - pos

    advancements.append(t_adv)

Wait, but pos can be up to len(s). For example, if pos is len(s), then advancement is 0.

So in code, for each t, create a list of len(s) +1 entries (for pos from 0 to len(s)).

But in the BFS, when pos is len(s), there's nothing left to do, so we can ignore processing it. But the code will handle it since when pos is dequeued, for any string, new_pos would be len(s) + advancement (which is 0) => len(s). So new_pos >= len(s) is true, and returns current_steps +1, but len(s) is already the target. So perhaps we need to handle this case.

Wait, the initial pos is 0. So during BFS processing, once a pos reaches len(s), we can immediately return the count. Because when pos is len(s), any string's advancement is zero, but adding that string would not contribute. However, if the BFS is processing pos len(s), then new_pos would be len(s), and the code would check if new_pos >= len(s) (which it is), and return the current steps +1. But that's incorrect, since we are already at the target.

So, we need to make sure that once the pos is len(s), we do not process any further. Because when pos is len(s), the code would check all strings, and for each, new_pos is len(s), so it would return (current steps +1) which is not needed.

So, perhaps, in the code, after checking if new_pos >= len(s), we return the steps +1. But when pos is len(s), the code would process all strings, and for each, new_pos is len(s), so return (current steps +1). But pos len(s) can only be enqueued if we reach it through some path, which is only possible if we have already reached the target. So this seems like a problem.

Wait, for example, suppose the code has enqueued pos = len(s). Then when processing it, for each string, the code would compute new_pos = len(s) + advancement (which is 0). So new_pos is len(s), and the code would return steps +1. But the correct count would be the steps when we first reached len(s), which is already the minimal steps. So this code would overcount.

Hence, the code must not process any pos >= len(s). Therefore, during the BFS, we need to process only pos < len(s).

So, in the code:

We enqueue a pos only if it's less than len(s).

But how to handle when a string's advancement takes us to len(s) or beyond.

So during the BFS processing of a pos:

   for each string:

       compute new_pos = pos + advancement

       if new_pos >= len(s):

           return current_steps +1

       else:

           if new_pos > pos and ...:

               process.

Thus, in the code, once any string's advancement for the current pos results in new_pos >= len(s), we return current_steps +1 immediately.

Thus, in the code, during the BFS processing of a pos, once any string leads to new_pos >= len(s), we return the answer.

So the code would not enqueue pos >= len(s), and would not process them.

This is correct.

Now, let's think about the example where s is "a", and the set has a string "a". Then the advancement for pos 0 is 1. So new_pos = 0 +1=1 >= len(s)=1, so return 0+1=1.

Which is correct.

Another example: s is "aaa", the first test case. The set has "a", "aa", "a". The code would precompute for each string:

For "a" (the first string):

advancement at pos 0 is 1. pos 1: 1. pos 2:1. pos3:0.

For "aa":

at pos0: 2, pos1:2, pos2:1, etc.

So the BFS starts at 0. For each string:

First string "a" gives new_pos=0+1=1. Since 1 <3, add to queue with count 1.

Then the second string "aa" gives new_pos=0+2=2. Add to queue with count1.

Third string "a" gives same as first.

So when processing pos 1 (count 1):

using "a" again gives new_pos=2. Using "aa" at pos1: advancement is 2 (since s[1] is a, s[2] is a. So "aa" would advance by 2. new_pos=1+2=3 >=3, so return 1+1=2. Which matches the first test case.

Thus, the code works.

Now, let's code this.

Implement:

Read n.

Read n strings into list.

Read s.

Check if all characters in s are present in the union of the set's strings. If not, output -1.

Else:

Precompute the advancement for each string and each pos.

Then, perform BFS.

Initialize a distance array with len(s)+1 elements, all set to infinity (like -1 or a large number). But in Python, perhaps using a list of len(s) +1, initialized to -1, and set distance[0] =0.

Use a deque. Start with pos=0.

Then, while queue is not empty:

   pos = deque.popleft()

   current_steps = distance[pos]

   for each string in the list:

       adv = advancement[string_index][pos]

       new_pos = pos + adv

       if new_pos >= len(s):

           print(current_steps +1)

           exit

       if new_pos > pos and (distance[new_pos] ==-1 or distance[new_pos] > current_steps +1):

           distance[new_pos] = current_steps +1

           append new_pos to the deque.

After processing all possibilities, if len(s) is not reached, return -1.

But how is that possible? Because we have all characters, but the order is not possible.

For example, s is "ab", set has "ba". The code would process:

pos0: advancement for "ba" is 1. new_pos=1. steps=1.

pos1: process "ba". advancement is 1 (because at pos1 (s[1] is 'b'), processing "ba" gives first 'b' which matches, so current becomes 2. new_pos=1+1=2. steps=1+1=2. new_pos >=2, so return 2.

Which is correct. So "baba" has "ab" as a subsequence.

But what if the order is such that it's impossible?

Wait, but if the code checks all possibilities, perhaps even in such cases.

Another example: s is "ab", set has "a", "b". Then, code would process:

pos0:

string "a" gives advancement 1. new_pos=1. steps=1.

string "b" gives advancement 0 (since 'b' does not match 'a').

pos1: process "b" gives advancement 1. new_pos=2. return 1+1=2.

So code returns 2, which is correct.

But what if the set has "ab" and "a"?

Then, code would find that using "ab" once gives advancement 2, so returns 1.

Which is correct.

So the code seems to handle all cases.

Now, let's code this in Python.

But in code:

The steps:

Read n.

Read n strings into a list.

Read s.

Check if s has any characters not present in the union of the set's characters.

If yes, output -1.

Else:

precompute advancements for each string and each pos.

Initialize distance as array of len(s)+1 elements, set to -1. distance[0] =0.

Use a deque.

from collections import deque

queue = deque([0])

distance[0] =0

while queue is not empty:

   pos = queue.popleft()

   for each string in the list:

       index = string's index.

       adv = advancements[index][pos]

       new_pos = pos + adv

       if new_pos >= len(s):

           print(distance[pos]+1)

           exit()

       if new_pos > pos:

           if distance[new_pos] ==-1 or distance[new_pos] > distance[pos] +1:

               distance[new_pos] = distance[pos] +1

               queue.append(new_pos)

After processing all, print -1.

But how to handle the precomputation.

Implementing the advancements:

advancements = []

for t in strings:

    t_adv = [0]*(len(s)+1)

    for pos in range(len(s)+1):

        current = pos

        for c in t:

            if current < len(s) and c == s[current]:

                current +=1

        t_adv[pos] = current - pos

    advancements.append(t_adv)

Yes.

Now, code in Python:

But in Python, strings are stored as per the input, and the code must process them.

Now, code:

Read n:

n = int(input())

strings = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

s = input().strip()

Check if all characters in s are present in any of the strings.

chars_in_set = set()

for t in strings:

    chars_in_set.update(t)

for c in s:

    if c not in chars_in_set:

        print(-1)

        exit()

Then, precompute advancements:

len_s = len(s)

advancements = []

for t in strings:

    t_adv = [0]*(len_s +1)

    for pos in range(len_s +1):

        current = pos

        for c in t:

            if current < len_s and c == s[current]:

                current +=1

        t_adv[pos] = current - pos

    advancements.append(t_adv)

Then, BFS:

distance = [-1]*(len_s +1)

distance[0] =0

from collections import deque

queue = deque([0])

while queue:

    pos = queue.popleft()

    for i in range(len(strings)):

        adv = advancements[i][pos]

        new_pos = pos + adv

        if new_pos >= len_s:

            print(distance[pos] +1)

            exit()

        if new_pos > pos:

            if distance[new_pos] == -1 or distance[new_pos] > distance[pos] +1:

                distance[new_pos] = distance[pos] +1

                queue.append(new_pos)

print(-1)

Wait, but in the code, the queue could be processed in any order, but since BFS is level order, the first time a new_pos is encountered, the distance is set to the minimal steps.

But in Python, the deque is FIFO, so it's a BFS.

But what about when a new_pos is found with a smaller distance than previously recorded?

We check if distance[new_pos] is either -1 or larger than the current steps +1. So even if new_pos was previously visited with a higher step count, we update it and enqueue again.

This is necessary because there might be a shorter path found later. For example, if a previous path took 3 steps to reach new_pos, but a new path takes 2 steps. So we need to update it.

But since the BFS processes nodes in order of their step count (because each step adds 1), once a node is dequeued, all paths to it are in step counts >= the current step count. So the first time a node is dequeued, it's with the minimal step count. Therefore, any subsequent updates to that node with higher steps are irrelevant. Therefore, the code can be optimized by not allowing updates once a node is visited. But in the code as written, it allows updates. However, given that the BFS is level-based, once a node is dequeued, its distance is minimal. So any new_pos that can be reached from it with higher steps would not be better. Therefore, the code could be modified to only process nodes that haven't been visited before. But the code as written is correct, but may have some inefficiency. However, given the small size of len(s) (2500), it's manageable.

For example, the code uses the deque and for each new_pos, updates the distance only if it's better. So even if a new_pos is enqueued multiple times with different steps, the first time it's processed (with minimal steps) will be the one that leads to the solution.

Thus, the code is correct.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import sys
from collections import deque


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline())
    strings = [input_stream.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]
    s = input_stream.readline().strip()
    
    # Check if all characters in s are present in the set
    set_chars = set()
    for t in strings:
        set_chars.update(t)
    for c in s:
        if c not in set_chars:
            print(-1, file=output_stream)
            return
    
    len_s = len(s)
    if len_s == 0:
        print(0, file=output_stream)
        return
    
    # Precompute advancements for each string and pos
    advancements = []
    for t in strings:
        t_adv = [0] * (len_s + 1)
        for pos in range(len_s + 1):
            current = pos
            for c in t:
                if current < len_s and c == s[current]:
                    current += 1
            t_adv[pos] = current - pos
        advancements.append(t_adv)
    
    # BFS to find the minimal steps
    distance = [-1] * (len_s + 1)
    distance[0] = 0
    queue = deque([0])
    
    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        for i in range(len(strings)):
            adv = advancements[i][pos]
            new_pos = pos + adv
            if new_pos >= len_s:
                print(distance[pos] + 1, file=output_stream)
                return
            if new_pos > pos:
                if distance[new_pos] == -1 or distance[new_pos] > distance[pos] + 1:
                    distance[new_pos] = distance[pos] + 1
                    queue.append(new_pos)
    
    print(-1, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
4
ab
aab
aa
bb
baaab
""",
            "output": \
"""\
3
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Thus, code returns 2.

Another example:

Input:

2

aaa

bbb

aaacbbb

Check characters: s has 'a', 'c', 'b'. The set has 'a's and 'b's. So 'c' is missing. code returns -1.

Which is correct.

Third example.

Another example: the second sample input.

Input:

4

ab

aab

aa

bb

baaab

s is "baaab".

Check all characters: 'b', 'a' are present.

precompute advancements for each string and pos.

The code's BFS will process the steps and find the minimal count.

But let's not go into detail here.

The code should handle it correctly.

Thus, the code should be correct.
