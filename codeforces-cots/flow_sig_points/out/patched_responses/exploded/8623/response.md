Okay, I need to solve this problem where given a number b, I have to find out how many distinct values of [a, b]/a there are for all a from 1 to 1e18. Let's think about this.

First, let's understand the mathematical expression here. The least common multiple of a and b divided by a. Remember that [a, b] is LCM(a, b), which is equal to (a*b)/gcd(a, b). So when we divide that by a, we get b/gcd(a, b). So the problem simplifies to finding the number of distinct values of b divided by the gcd of a and b, where a can be any positive integer.

But wait, since a can be up to 1e18, but b is given as up to 1e10. However, since the value depends on the gcd between a and b, maybe there's a way to model this in terms of the divisors of b.

Let me think. Let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Then d must divide both a and b. Let's write a as d * k, where k is an integer. Then, since d divides b, let's write b as d * m, where m is an integer. Then, the gcd(a, b) is d. So the expression becomes b/(d) = (d*m)/d = m. Wait, no. Wait, the expression is b divided by the gcd(a, b), which is d. So that's (b)/d. Since d is a divisor of b, because d is the gcd of a and b, and b is fixed.

Wait, d must be a divisor of b. Because gcd(a, b) divides b. So all possible d's are the divisors of b. Therefore, for each d that divides b, the possible values of the expression are b/d. But wait, how?

Wait, for any a, the gcd(a, b) is some d that divides b. So for each possible d that is a divisor of b, there exists an a such that gcd(a, b) is d. Therefore, the possible values of the expression are b/d, where d is a divisor of b. But wait, are all possible d divisors of b possible to be the gcd(a, b) for some a?

Yes. Because, for example, if d is a divisor of b, then take a = d. Then the gcd(d, b) is d. So in that case, the value is b/d. Therefore, each divisor d of b gives a possible value of b/d. So the number of distinct values is equal to the number of distinct divisors of b.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me check the examples.

In the first example, b is 1. The divisors of 1 are only 1. So the number of values is 1, which matches the sample output.

In the second example, b is 2. The divisors are 1 and 2. So the possible values are 2/1 =2 and 2/2=1. So two distinct values, which matches the sample. So yes, the answer is the number of divisors of b. Wait, but that's too straightforward. But the problem states that a can be up to 1e18, but the sample suggests that the answer is the number of divisors of b. So maybe that's the case.

But wait, let's test another example. Suppose b is 4. Divisors are 1, 2, 4. So possible values are 4/1=4, 4/2=2, 4/4=1. So three values. So the answer would be 3. Let's see.

But is there a scenario where two different divisors d1 and d2 of b give the same value of b/d? For example, if b is 6. Divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6. So b/d would be 6, 3, 2, 1. So all distinct. So for any b, the number of distinct values is equal to the number of divisors of b. So the problem reduces to finding the number of divisors of b.

Wait, but what if b is 8. Divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8. Then the values are 8,4,2,1. All distinct. So the answer is 4.

But this seems to contradict the original problem statement's note for the second example. Wait, no. In the second example, the answer is 2, which equals the number of divisors of 2 (1 and 2). Yes.

So according to this reasoning, the answer is the number of divisors of b. But why?

Because for each divisor d of b, there exists an a such that gcd(a, b) = d. Then the value is b/d, and since d is a divisor of b, each d gives a distinct value? Wait, no. Wait, suppose b is 6. The divisors are 1,2,3,6. Then the values would be 6,3,2,1. All distinct. So the answer is 4. But if b is 9, divisors 1,3,9. So values 9,3,1. All distinct. So answer is 3. So yes, each divisor gives a unique value.

Because d1 and d2 are divisors of b. If b/d1 = b/d2, then d1 = d2. So the mapping from d to b/d is injective. Because if d1 and d2 are distinct, then since they are divisors of b, and b is fixed, b/d1 and b/d2 would also be distinct. Therefore, each divisor gives a unique value. So the number of distinct values is exactly the number of divisors of b.

But wait, this can't be right. Wait, for example, if b is 12. Divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12. The values are 12,6,4,3,2,1. All distinct. So the answer is 6. So yes, each divisor's reciprocal (when multiplied by b) gives a distinct value. So the answer is the number of divisors of b.

So the problem reduces to counting the number of divisors of b. But how can that be? Let's check the first sample. Yes. The answer is the number of divisors. So the solution is to compute the number of divisors of b.

Wait, but this seems too simple. The problem must have a hidden twist. Let me think again.

The original problem asks for the number of distinct values of [a, b]/a for a from 1 to 1e18. But [a, b]/a = LCM(a, b)/a = b / GCD(a, b). So the expression is equal to b divided by the GCD of a and b.

But the GCD can be any divisor of b. For example, take a to be any multiple of d, where d is a divisor of b. Then, the GCD(a, b) is d if a is such that when divided by d, the remaining part (a/d) is coprime with b/d.

Wait, but in any case, for any divisor d of b, there exists an a such that GCD(a, b) = d. For example, a = d. Then, GCD(d, b) is d, since d divides b.

Therefore, for every divisor d of b, the value b/d is achievable. And each such value is unique, because d is a divisor, so if d1 and d2 are different divisors, then b/d1 and b/d2 are different. Because if b/d1 = b/d2, then d1 =d2.

Therefore, the answer is the number of divisors of b.

So the problem reduces to computing the number of divisors of b.

But then the problem is very simple. For example, given b, find the number of its divisors.

But let's check the sample input 2. For b=2, the divisors are 1 and 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches.

So the problem is indeed equivalent to counting the number of divisors of b.

So the solution is to factorize b into its prime factors, and compute the product of (exponent +1) for each prime.

So the steps are:

1. Factorize b into its prime factors.

2. For each prime exponent, compute (exponent +1) and multiply them all together.

But how to factorize b when b is up to 1e10?

Well, for 1e10, the maximum possible factors are up to sqrt(1e10) which is 1e5, which is manageable.

So the algorithm would be:

- For the given b, compute its prime factors.

- Then, the number of divisors is the product of (exponent +1) for each prime.

Thus, the code can be written as follows.

But wait, what if b is 1? Then the number of divisors is 1.

Yes.

So the code needs to:

- Read b.

- Compute the prime factors of b.

- Compute the product of (exponent +1) for each factor.

So for example, for b=12=2^2 * 3^1, the number of divisors is (2+1)*(1+1)=3*2=6.

Which is correct.

Thus, the problem is indeed equivalent to counting the number of divisors of b.

Therefore, the code can be written by factorizing b and counting the number of divisors.

Now, how to factorize b efficiently in Python.

Given that b can be up to 1e10, the trial division approach up to sqrt(n) should be acceptable.

So the steps for factorization:

Initialize a list to hold the factors.

Check divisors starting from 2 up to sqrt(n). For each divisor, count how many times it divides n, then add (exponent +1) to the product.

Handle the case when after processing, the remaining n is greater than 1 (meaning it's a prime factor).

So, code outline:

Read b.

Compute the number of divisors of b.

Print that number.

So the code in Python would look like:

But let's think about possible edge cases.

For b=1: factors are 1^1. So number of divisors is 1.

For b=0: but according to the problem statement, b is at least 1. So no need to handle that.

Another example: b=6. Divisors 1,2,3,6. So 4 divisors. So output is 4.

So the code needs to correctly factorize b.

So the code can be written as:

def count_divisors(b):
    if b == 0:
        return 0
    divisors = 1
    current = b
    i = 2
    while i*i <= current:
        if current % i == 0:
            exponent = 0
            while current % i == 0:
                exponent +=1
                current = current // i
            divisors *= (exponent +1)
        i +=1
    if current >1:
        divisors *= 2
    return divisors

But wait, in the code above, for the remaining current after the loop. For example, if current is a prime number greater than 1, then its exponent is 1, so multiply by (1+1)=2.

Yes.

But in the problem statement, the answer is the number of divisors of b. So the code can be written as:

Read b, compute the number of divisors, and print that.

So the code would be:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    b = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    if b ==0:
        print(0, file=output_stream)
    else:
        res =1
        n =b
        i=2
        while i*i <=n:
            if n%i ==0:
                cnt =0
                while n%i ==0:
                    cnt +=1
                    n =n//i
                res *= cnt +1
            i +=1
        if n >1:
            res *=2
        print(res, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
2
""",
            "output": \
"""\
2
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Sample input 2: 2. The code starts with i=2. 2*2 <=2? 4>2? No. So enter loop. Check if 2 divides 2. Yes. cnt increments to 1. n becomes 1. res *=1+1=2. Then, exit loop. n is 1, so no more factors. So res is 2. Output 2. Correct.

Another test case with b=4: divisors 1,2,4. So code. i=2, i*i=4 <=4. n=4. 4%2=0. cnt=2. res *=3. Then n becomes 1. So after loop, n=1. So res is 3. Which is correct.

Yes. So this code should work.

So the answer is to compute the number of divisors of b. So the code is straightforward.

b = int(input())

    if n % i == 0:
        count = 0
        while n % i == 0:
            count += 1
            n //= i
        result *= (count + 1)
    i += 1
if n > 1:
    result *= 2
print(result)
```
