<think>
Okay, let's try to understand this problem. So, we have an acyclic directed graph. The key points here are that the number of sources equals the number of sinks, and each is at most 20. We need to determine if, regardless of the choices made during the algorithm (which pairs of sources and sinks are connected each step), the resulting graph ends up being strongly connected.

Hmm. The algorithm adds edges from a sink to a source in each step until there are no sources or sinks left. Each addition reduces the number of sources and sinks by one each. Eventually, after adding k edges (where k is the initial number of sources/sinks), the graph should become such that it's strongly connected no matter the choices made along the way.

Wait, the problem says that the final graph must be strongly connected for any possible sequence of adding the edges. So even if the choices of s and t vary, the end result must be the same. Our task is to check if all possible such sequences lead to a strongly connected graph.

But how can we model all possible choices? The constraints on the number of sources and sinks (each up to 20) suggest that maybe we can model the problem by considering all possible pairings between sources and sinks, perhaps using bitmasking or permutations. But even 20 sources would have 20! possible pairings, which is way too big. So that's not feasible.

Wait, but the order in which we pair the sources and sinks might not matter as long as each source is connected to some sink in a way that forms a single cycle. Or maybe the problem can be transformed into checking some conditions on the original graph's sources and sinks.

Let me think about what happens when we add edges. Each added edge t→s connects a sink to a source. After all edges are added, each original source and sink is part of a cycle. For the graph to be strongly connected, all these cycles must be interconnected.

But how to model this?

Alternatively, after adding all the edges, the graph should have a single strongly connected component (SCC) that includes all nodes. So, regardless of the order in which edges are added, the final graph must have this property.

Wait, but the edges added are from sinks to sources. So, in the original DAG, the sources have no incoming edges, and sinks have no outgoing edges. When adding edges t→s (s is a source, t is a sink), each such edge creates a possible path from t's ancestors to s's descendants.

But the original graph is a DAG, so the added edges are the only cycles introduced. Each step reduces the number of sources and sinks by one. Once all sources and sinks are processed, the graph will have no sources or sinks, so the algorithm stops.

So the final graph after adding all possible edges (k pairs, where k is the initial count) should be such that all nodes are part of a single cycle formed by these added edges and the original edges.

But how do we check that regardless of the order in which edges are added, the final graph is strongly connected?

An alternative approach: For the final graph to be strongly connected, it must satisfy that for any two nodes u and v, there's a path from u to v. However, since the edges added depend on the choices made, we need to ensure that for all possible sequences of adding edges, the paths exist.

But checking all possible sequences is impossible for 20 sources/sinks. So we need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the necessary conditions that must hold regardless of the pairing. For example, the original DAG's structure must be such that when any possible set of edges between sources and sinks is added (in a way that pairs each source with a sink exactly once), the entire graph becomes strongly connected.

Wait, but each step pairs a source with a sink. So the process of adding edges is a permutation where each source is matched with a sink. For example, if there are k sources and k sinks, then the possible pairings are permutations of the sinks (assuming sources and sinks are considered as ordered lists). Wait, but the problem allows choosing any source and any sink in each step. So the order in which pairs are chosen can vary, but each source and sink is used exactly once. So, the set of added edges would form a bijection between sources and sinks. But the order in which they are added may not matter as long as each source and sink is used once.

Wait, no. Because in each step, after adding an edge, the source and sink are removed from their respective sets. So the process must pair each source with exactly one sink. For example, if we have sources S1, S2 and sinks T1, T2. Then, possible pairings are (S1→T1, S2→T2) or (S1→T2, S2→T1), etc. But each step can choose any remaining source and any remaining sink. So the final set of edges added is a bijection between the initial sources and sinks.

Ah! So the algorithm effectively creates a bipartite matching between sources and sinks. Each source is matched to exactly one sink, and each sink to exactly one source. The order of adding the edges doesn't affect the final set of edges added, only the order in which they are added. But the edges are the same: each source is connected to exactly one sink. So the problem reduces to: for all possible perfect matchings between the sources and sinks (each source paired with a unique sink), after adding the edges of the matching (from the sink to the source), the graph must be strongly connected.

Wait, but wait. Because in the algorithm, each step adds an edge from the chosen sink t to the chosen source s. So the edge is t → s. And each source and sink is used exactly once. So the set of edges added is a set of k edges where each is from a sink to a source, and each source and sink appears in exactly one edge. So this is a bijection between sources and sinks: each source is matched to a sink, and the edge is from the sink to the source.

So, the problem is equivalent to checking that for every possible bijection between sources and sinks (i.e., every possible way to pair each source with a unique sink and add an edge from the sink to the source), the resulting graph is strongly connected.

So the key is to check that for all possible perfect matchings between sources and sinks, after adding the edges of the matching (sink to source), the graph is strongly connected.

But checking all possible permutations of k elements (k up to 20) is impossible, as 20! is way too big.

Therefore, we need to find a condition that, when satisfied, ensures that regardless of the matching, the graph becomes strongly connected.

What's the necessary and sufficient condition for that?

Let me think of the structure after adding the edges. The added edges form a bijection between sources and sinks. So, each added edge is part of a cycle. For example, if source s is connected to sink t (edge t → s), then there must be a path from s to t in the original graph, so that adding the edge t→s creates a cycle s → ... → t → s. If this is true for all edges in the matching, then each such edge forms a cycle, and these cycles must be connected in a way that the entire graph is a single strongly connected component.

Alternatively, the original graph must be such that for any pair (s, t) where s is a source and t is a sink, there exists a path from s to t. Because when you add the edge t→s, the cycle s → ... → t → s exists, making the entire cycle part of an SCC. Then, if all sources can reach all sinks, adding any matching edges would connect all these cycles into a single component.

Wait, but if that's the case, then for any possible matching between sources and sinks, the graph would be strongly connected. Because each added edge connects a sink to a source, and there's a path from the source to the sink in the original graph, so adding the edge creates a cycle. If all sources can reach all sinks, then the cycles are interconnected. So for example, if there are two sources s1 and s2, and two sinks t1 and t2. If s1 can reach t1, t2; s2 can reach t1, t2, then regardless of the matching (s1-t1 and s2-t2, or s1-t2 and s2-t1), the cycles formed would have paths connecting them. For example, in the first case, s1's cycle is s1→...→t1→s1, s2's cycle is s2→...→t2→s2. But since s1 can reach t2 (via the original graph), and t2 can reach s2 (via the added edge), then the two cycles are connected.

Wait, maybe not. Let's see. Suppose in the original graph, each source can reach all sinks. Then, when you add edges that form a matching between sources and sinks, the cycles formed are each s_i → ... → t_j → s_i (where j is the matched sink). But if s_i can reach any t, then perhaps these cycles are connected.

But perhaps the key condition is that for every source s and every sink t, there is a path from s to t in the original graph. Because then, regardless of how s and t are matched, the added edge t→s creates a cycle. Moreover, since s can reach any other sink t', and t' can reach its matched source s', which can reach any sink, etc., all cycles are connected, leading to a single SCC.

So the condition is: for every source s and every sink t, s can reach t in the original graph.

If this condition holds, then any matching's edges would allow cycles to be interconnected. Because in the original graph, any source can reach any sink, and when edges are added between sinks and sources, the cycles formed will have cross-connections.

Let's take the example where the sources are s1, s2 and the sinks are t1, t2. Suppose s1 can reach both t1 and t2, and s2 can reach both. If we pair s1 with t1 and s2 with t2, the added edges are t1→s1 and t2→s2. The cycle for s1 is s1 -> ... -> t1 -> s1, and for s2, it's s2 -> ... -> t2 -> s2. But since s1 can reach t2 (original path), and t2 is connected to s2 (via edge), then s2 can reach t1 (since s2 can reach t2 in original, then via added edge t2→s2's edge? Wait, maybe not. Wait, no. Wait, the added edge is t2→s2. So in the modified graph, from s2, you can go along the original path to t2, then via the added edge to s2 again. But how does that connect to other cycles?

Wait, if s1 can reach t1 and t2, then in the modified graph, from t1 (the sink) there's an edge to s1. So any node in s1's cycle can reach any node in t1's cycle. But how do the cycles connect?

Alternatively, let's think of the entire graph. Suppose that all sources can reach all sinks. Then, for any matching of sources to sinks, the added edges create a collection of cycles. Moreover, any two cycles are connected via existing edges. For example, consider cycle A: s_i → ... → t_j → s_i. And cycle B: s_k → ... → t_l → s_k. Since s_i can reach t_l (as it's a sink), and t_l is connected to s_k (if s_k is matched with t_l), then there's a path from cycle A to cycle B. Similarly, s_k can reach t_j, which is connected to s_i, so there's a path back. So all cycles are interconnected, forming a single strongly connected component.

Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that every source can reach every sink in the original graph.

If this condition holds, then any matching would result in a strongly connected graph. Otherwise, there exists a matching that would split the graph into multiple components.

So, the problem reduces to checking for each source s whether s can reach all sinks t. Similarly, but perhaps we need to check that all sources can reach all sinks.

Wait, that's the main point. For all sources s and all sinks t, there must be a path from s to t in the original graph.

If that's true, then regardless of the matching, adding the edges t → s (for each pair in the matching) will create a graph where all nodes are part of a single SCC.

But how do we confirm this?

Let's test the examples.

First example:

Input:
3 1
1 2

Original graph: 1→2. So the sources are 1 (since it has no incoming edges). The sinks are 2 (since it has no outgoing edges) and 3 (no edges at all). Wait, but the problem states that the number of sources equals the number of sinks. Wait, the problem says that the number of sources is equal to the number of sinks. So in this example, after building the original graph, how many sources and sinks are there?

Vertices:

1 has an outgoing edge to 2. So for 1: in-degree 0 (since no incoming edges). So it's a source. For 2: in-degree 1 (from 1), out-degree 0 (since no edges leaving). So it's a sink. Vertex 3: in-degree 0 and out-degree 0. So it's both a source and a sink. So the number of sources is 2 (1 and 3), the number of sinks is 2 (2 and 3). So they are equal. So during the algorithm, two edges are added. For example, in step 1, choose a source (either 1 or 3) and a sink (either 2 or 3). Then add the edge from the sink to the source.

But the problem says that after adding edges, the graph must be strongly connected regardless of the choices. Let's see. The original sources are 1 and 3, sinks 2 and 3.

The possible pairings are (1 with 2, 3 with 3) or (1 with 3, 3 with 2) etc. Let's consider the first pairing. Adding edges 2→1 and 3→3. Then the graph becomes:

Original edges: 1→2.

Added edges: 2→1, 3→3.

Now, check if the graph is strongly connected. The component of 1 and 2 forms a cycle (1→2→1). The component of 3 has a self-loop. But there's no path between 3 and 1/2. So the graph is not strongly connected. Hence the output is NO, which matches the example.

In this case, the sources are 1 and 3. The sinks are 2 and 3. The condition that all sources can reach all sinks is not met. For example, source 3 can't reach sink 2 (since 3 has no outgoing edges in the original graph). So the condition fails. Hence the output is NO.

Second example:

Input:
3 3
1 2
1 3
2 3

Original edges: 1→2, 1→3, 2→3. The sources are 1 (in-degree 0). The sinks are 3 (out-degree 0). So sources and sinks count is 1 each. So during the algorithm, one edge is added: 3→1.

The new graph has edges 3→1, and the original edges. Now, check strong connectivity. 1 can reach 2 via 1→2, 2→3, and 3→1, so cycles. All nodes are in a single cycle. So output is YES. The condition holds here: the source (1) can reach all sinks (3). So yes, output is YES.

Third example:

4 4
1 2
1 3
4 2
4 3

Original edges: 1→2, 1→3, 4→2, 4→3.

Sources are 1 and 4 (both have in-degree 0). Sinks are 2 and 3 (both have out-degree 0). So two sources and two sinks. The algorithm adds two edges. The condition requires that each source can reach each sink. Let's check:

Source 1 can reach 2 (via 1→2), and 3 (1→3). So yes.

Source 4 can reach 2 (4→2) and 3 (4→3). So all sources can reach all sinks.

Hence, regardless of the matching (e.g., 1 paired with 2, 4 with 3; or 1 with 3 and 4 with 2), the added edges would be 2→1 and 3→4, or 3→1 and 2→4. Let's see:

In the first case, added edges 2→1 and 3→4. Now, 1 can reach 2 (original edge) which connects to 1. 4 can reach 3, which connects to 4. But how are these connected? Well, 1 can reach 3 via 1→3. From 3, there's the added edge 3→4. From 4, you can go to 2 or 3. Wait, 4 has edges to 2 and 3. So 4 can reach 2, which has an edge back to 1. So 4 can reach 1 via 4→2→1. Then 1 can reach 3, etc. So all nodes are connected. So the graph is strongly connected.

In the other case, added edges 3→1 and 2→4. Then, 1 can reach 3 (original edge) which connects back to 1. 4 can reach 2 (original edge) which connects to 4. But 3 can reach 4 via 3→1→2 (if 1 can reach 2) → 2→4. So all nodes are connected.

Thus, the condition holds, and output is YES.

So the key condition is that every source can reach every sink in the original graph. So the problem reduces to checking whether for every source s and sink t, s can reach t.

If that's the case, then any matching between sources and sinks will create edges that form cycles which are all interconnected, leading to a strongly connected graph.

So the steps to solve the problem are:

1. Find all sources and sinks in the original graph.
2. For each source s, check if s can reach every sink t.
3. If all sources can reach all sinks, output YES; else, NO.

But how do we efficiently check this given the constraints (n up to 1e6, m up to 1e6)?

The problem is, the number of sources and sinks can be up to 20 each. For each source, we need to check reachability to all sinks.

But with 20 sources and 20 sinks, that's 400 reachability checks. For each check, we need to perform a BFS or DFS, which could be O(n + m) each. For 400 * 1e6 operations, that's 4e8, which is way too slow.

Thus, we need a more efficient approach.

Alternative approach: precompute for each node whether it can reach each sink. Then, for each source, check if all sinks are reachable.

But again, how to do this efficiently.

Wait, the graph is a DAG. So we can process nodes in topological order and compute for each node the set of sinks it can reach.

But how to represent the set of sinks each node can reach? Since there are up to 20 sinks, we can represent the set as a bitmask, where each bit corresponds to a sink. For each node, the bitmask will have a bit set for each sink that the node can reach.

Once we have this bitmask for each node, then for each source, we can check if all bits corresponding to sinks are set (i.e., the bitmask equals (1 << k) - 1, where k is the number of sinks).

Thus, the steps are:

1. Find all sources and sinks.
2. Assign each sink a unique index (0 to k-1, where k is the number of sinks).
3. For each node in the DAG, compute a bitmask representing the sinks it can reach.
4. For each source, check if its bitmask includes all sinks (i.e., is all 1s).
5. If all sources have this property, output YES. Else, NO.

Now, the problem is to compute the reachable sinks for each node in an efficient way, given the DAG.

The DAG can be processed in topological order. For each node, the reachable sinks are the union of the reachable sinks of its children. For example, if a node u has edges to v1 and v2, then the sinks reachable from u are the union of the sinks reachable from v1 and v2.

But since the graph is a DAG, we can process the nodes in reverse topological order (i.e., starting from the nodes with no outgoing edges, which are the sinks, and moving towards the sources).

Wait, in topological order, nodes are processed such that all dependencies (outgoing edges) are processed after the node. Wait, perhaps processing in reverse topological order (sinks first) would allow propagating the reachability upwards.

Alternatively, process the nodes in topological order (from sources to sinks), but for each node, when processing it, we can collect the reachability from all its outgoing edges.

Wait, maybe processing nodes in reverse topological order (from sinks to sources) would be better. Because a node's reachable sinks are determined by its outgoing edges. For example, if a node has an edge to a node that can reach sinks S1, S2, then this node can reach S1 and S2.

So for each node u, the sinks it can reach are the union of the sinks reachable by each of its children.

So, if we process the nodes in reverse topological order (i.e., starting from sinks and moving upwards), then when we process a node u, all of its children (nodes it points to) have already been processed, so their reachable sinks are known.

Thus, the approach is:

- Assign each sink a unique index (0 to k-1).
- For each node, initialize their bitmask to 0. For sinks, set their own bit in the bitmask.
- Process the nodes in reverse topological order. For each node u, for each outgoing edge u→v, set u's bitmask to the OR of its current value and v's bitmask.
- Once all nodes are processed, for each source, check if its bitmask includes all sinks (i.e., has all bits set).

This approach would be O(n + m), which is acceptable for n up to 1e6.

So, how to implement this:

First, find all sources and sinks.

Then, assign each sink an index. For each node, if it is a sink, set its bitmask to 1 << index.

Then, process the nodes in reverse topological order. For each node u, iterate through its outgoing edges u→v, and set the bitmask for u as the OR of all bitmasks of v.

Wait, no. Because u can reach any sink that any of its children can reach. So for each u, the bitmask is the OR of the bitmasks of all its children.

Wait, but u's outgoing edges are to its children. So for each u, the reachable sinks are the union of the reachable sinks of all its children (since u can go to any of its children, and then follow their paths to sinks). So, for u's bitmask, we take the OR of the bitmasks of all its children.

But how do we process this efficiently?

The reverse topological order here would be the order such that all nodes that u can reach (children) are processed before u. So for example, in a DAG, the reverse topological order is the same as the topological order but in reverse. So, the processing starts from the sinks (which have no outgoing edges) and moves towards the sources.

Wait, perhaps the reverse topological order is the same as the topological order of the reversed graph. Let's think:

The original DAG's topological order is a linear ordering of nodes such that for every edge u→v, u comes before v. So the reverse topological order would have v come before u. So in reverse topological order, nodes are processed in an order where all children (nodes they point to) have already been processed.

Wait, no. In reverse topological order, for every edge u→v, u is processed after v. Because in the original topological order, u comes before v. So the reverse would have v before u.

Wait, no. The topological order is such that all parents come before children. So reverse topological order would have children come before parents. So when processing in reverse topological order, for each node u, all its children (nodes it points to) have already been processed, allowing us to compute u's reachable sinks by OR-ing their bitmask.

Thus, for each node u, after processing all its children, we can compute u's bitmask as the OR of the bitmasks of all its children.

This is correct because u can reach any of the sinks that any of its children can reach.

Thus, the algorithm would be:

1. Find all sinks and assign each a unique index (0-based).
2. For each node, initialize their bitmask: if the node is a sink, set its bitmask to 1 << index. Else, 0.
3. Compute the reverse topological order of the DAG (i.e., process nodes such that all children are processed before the node).
4. For each node u in reverse topological order:
   a. For each outgoing edge u→v:
   b. Set u's bitmask |= v's bitmask.
5. For each source, check if its bitmask includes all sinks (i.e., all bits set).

If all sources meet this condition, output YES. Else, NO.

Now, the steps to implement this.

First, we need to find the sources and sinks. A source is a node with in-degree 0. A sink is a node with out-degree 0. We can compute in-degree and out-degree for each node.

But with n up to 1e6, we can store in_degree and out_degree as arrays of size n+1 (assuming nodes are numbered from 1 to n).

Once we have the sources and sinks, we need to assign indexes to the sinks. For example, create a list of sinks, and for each sink in the list, assign 0, 1, ..., k-1.

Then, for each node, check if it is a sink. If yes, set its bitmask to 1 << index.

Then, process the nodes in reverse topological order. How to compute reverse topological order?

The standard way to compute topological order is via Kahn's algorithm (using in-degree and a queue). The topological order is the order in which nodes are added to the sorted list. The reverse topological order would be the reverse of this list.

Alternatively, since the graph is a DAG, a reverse topological order can be obtained by reversing the topological order.

But with n up to 1e6, we need an efficient way to compute the topological order.

Implementing Kahn's algorithm:

Initialize a queue with nodes of in-degree 0 (sources). Then, process each node, decrement the in-degree of its children, and add to the queue when in-degree becomes 0.

This gives a topological order.

Once we have the topological order, the reverse of it is the reverse topological order, which is the order in which each node is processed after all its children.

Yes. So, once we have the topological order (a list), we can reverse it to get the reverse topological order.

So steps:

- Compute in_degree and adjacency list.
- Compute topological order using Kahn's algorithm.
- Reverse the topological order to get the reverse order.

Once we have the reverse order, process each node in that order. For each node u in the reversed topological order:

   For each neighbor v in u's adjacency list (u→v edges), accumulate v's bitmask into u's bitmask.

Wait, but u's outgoing edges are u→v. So, for each such v, when processing u in reverse topological order, v would have already been processed (since in reverse topological order, children are processed before parents). So, for u's outgoing edges, v's bitmask is already computed. Thus, we can OR all v's bitmask into u's bitmask.

Once this is done, for each source, we check if their bitmask is all 1s (i.e., (1 << k) - 1, where k is the number of sinks).

If all sources satisfy this, output YES. Else, NO.

Now, let's test this approach with the examples.

First example:

Original graph: 1→2. Sources are 1 and 3 (since 3 has in_degree 0 and out_degree 0). Sinks are 2 and 3. So k=2.

Assign sink 2 index 0, sink 3 index 1.

Then, for node 2, bitmask is 1 << 0 (binary 01). For node 3, bitmask is 1 << 1 (binary 10).

Topological order of the original graph is [1,2,3], since 1 has in_degree 0, then 2 (after 1 is processed), then 3 (no edges). Reversed topological order is [3,2,1].

Processing nodes in reversed order:

Process 3: it's a sink. So bitmask is 10. No outgoing edges. So nothing to do.

Process 2: it's a sink. Bitmask is 01. No outgoing edges. So nothing to do.

Process 1: outgoing edge to 2. So take bitmask of 2 (01) and OR into 1's bitmask. So 1's bitmask becomes 01.

So the sources are 1 and 3. For source 1: bitmask is 01 (covers sink 2 but not 3). For source 3: bitmask is 10 (covers sink 3 but not 2). So not all sinks are covered for each source. Hence output is NO.

Which matches the example.

Second example:

Original edges: 1→2, 1→3, 2→3.

Sources are 1 (in_degree 0). Sinks are 3 (out_degree 0). So k=1.

Sink 3 has index 0. Bitmask for 3 is 1 << 0 = 1.

Topological order is [1, 2, 3]. Reversed order is [3,2,1].

Processing 3: bitmask is 1. No edges.

Processing 2: outgoing edge to 3. So bitmask of 2 is OR of 3's bitmask (1). So 2's bitmask is 1.

Processing 1: outgoing edges to 2 and 3. OR their bitmask (1 | 1) = 1. So 1's bitmask is 1. Source 1's bitmask is 1, which covers all sinks (only sink 3). So output YES.

Third example:

Sources are 1 and 4. Sinks are 2 and 3. Assign indexes 0 to 2 and 3.

Wait, the sinks are 2 and 3, both with out_degree 0.

So, for node 2, index 0. Node 3, index 1. Their bitmask is 01 and 10.

Processing in reverse topological order.

What is the topological order of the DAG in the third example?

Original edges are 1→2, 1→3, 4→2, 4→3.

The nodes 1 and 4 are sources (in_degree 0). The DAG has two separate paths: 1→2 and 1→3. 4→2 and 4→3. The nodes 2 and 3 are sinks.

Topological order could be 1,4,2,3 (or 4,1,2,3, or similar). The reverse order would be 3,2,4,1.

Processing node 3 first (sink). Its bitmask is 10 (index 1). Then node 2 (sink) bitmask 01.

Then node 4: it has edges to 2 and 3. So OR their bitmask: 01 | 10 = 11. So node 4's bitmask is 11.

Then node 1: edges to 2 and 3. OR their bitmask 01 | 10 = 11. So bitmask is 11.

Sources are 1 and 4. Both have bitmask 11, which includes all sinks. So output YES.

Thus, the approach works.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

But with n up to 1e6 and m up to 1e6, we need to handle large input efficiently.

But in Python, handling 1e6 nodes with adjacency lists can be done with lists. Also, using bitmask with 20 bits is manageable.

So steps:

1. Read n and m.

2. Initialize in_degree and out_degree arrays of size n+1 (since nodes are numbered from 1 to n).

3. Read the m edges, build the adjacency list, and update in_degree and out_degree.

4. Find all sources (in_degree 0) and sinks (out_degree 0).

5. Check if the number of sources equals the number of sinks. But the problem statement says this is guaranteed, so we can skip.

6. Assign each sink a unique index (from 0 to k-1, where k is the number of sinks). Create a dictionary or a list that maps sink nodes to their indices.

7. Initialize a bitmask for each node. For sinks, set the bit corresponding to their index. Others are 0.

8. Compute the topological order using Kahn's algorithm.

9. Reverse the topological order to get the reverse order.

10. Process each node in reverse order: for each outgoing edge, OR the child's bitmask into the current node's bitmask.

11. For each source, check if its bitmask is (1 << k) - 1. If any source fails this, output NO. Else, YES.

But how to handle this in Python efficiently?

Implementing Kahn's algorithm for large n:

We can use a deque for the queue. For in_degree, we can use a list. For adjacency list, a list of lists.

But with n up to 1e6, we need to initialize the adjacency list as a list of empty lists for each node.

In Python, it's possible to create a list of lists for 1e6 nodes, but memory might be tight. Let's see: each list entry is a list. For 1e6 nodes, each with an average of 1 edge (m=1e6), the total storage is O(m). So it's manageable.

So code steps:

Read n and m.

Initialize in_degree and out_degree as [0] * (n+1).

adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

Read m edges, for each u, v:

adj[u].append(v)

in_degree[v] += 1

out_degree[u] += 1

Then, collect sources and sinks.

sources = [u for u in range(1, n+1) if in_degree[u] == 0]

sinks = [u for u in range(1, n+1) if out_degree[u] == 0]

k = len(sinks)

sink_index = {u: i for i, u in enumerate(sinks)}

Then, initialize bitmask for each node:

bitmask = [0] * (n + 1)

for u in sinks:

    bitmask[u] = 1 << sink_index[u]

Then compute topological order using Kahn's algorithm.

Initialize queue with all sources.

topo_order = []

q = deque(sources)

while q:

    u = q.popleft()

    topo_order.append(u)

    for v in adj[u]:

        in_degree[v] -= 1

        if in_degree[v] == 0:

            q.append(v)

Wait, but in_degree was modified when reading edges. So, after building the adjacency list, we need to recompute in_degree for Kahn's algorithm. Because when we read the edges, we modified in_degree, but after that, we need to use a copy of in_degree for Kahn's algorithm.

Wait, no. Because after reading edges, in_degree is correct. For example, in_degree[v] is the number of incoming edges to v. So Kahn's algorithm uses the original in_degree.

Wait, but in the code above, after building adj and initial in_degree, when processing the edges, in_degree is correct. So the Kahn's algorithm code is okay.

But wait, the code that builds the adjacency list and in_degree is correct. So the Kahn's algorithm will correctly compute the topological order.

Once topological order is computed, reverse it to get the reversed order.

reverse_topo = reversed(topo_order)

Then, for each u in reverse_topo:

   for v in adj[u]:

       bitmask[u] |= bitmask[v]

Wait, but adj[u] is the list of nodes that u points to. For each such v, we OR the bitmask of v into u's bitmask.

Wait, no. Because when you process u in reversed topological order (which is the reverse of the topological order), then all nodes that u can reach (children) have already been processed. So for each outgoing edge u→v, v is processed before u. Thus, when we process u, v's bitmask has already been computed. So, for each u in reversed_topo:

   current_bitmask = 0

   for v in adj[u]:

       current_bitmask |= bitmask[v]

   bitmask[u] |= current_bitmask  # since bitmask[u] was initialized for sinks.

Wait, but for non-sink nodes, their initial bitmask is 0. Then, processing their outgoing edges and OR-ing their children's bitmasks into their own.

Yes.

Once all nodes are processed, check each source in the sources list. For each source s, check if bitmask[s] == (1 << k) - 1.

If all sources satisfy this, output YES. Else, NO.

But let's see for the third example:

After processing, the sources (1 and 4) have bitmask 3 (binary 11) which is (1 << 2) -1 = 3. So they pass.

So the code should work.

But in Python, handling 1e6 nodes and 1e6 edges may be challenging in terms of speed and memory.

But for the given constraints, the code needs to be optimized.

Potential optimizations:

- Use a list for adj to make it as efficient as possible.

- Precompute the reversed topological order as a list, then iterate through it.

But in Python, reversing the list can be done with topo_order[::-1], which is O(n) time.

But for 1e6 nodes, it's manageable.

Another potential issue: the reversed topological order may not process nodes in the correct order. For example, if the original topological order is [1,2,3,4], the reversed is [4,3,2,1]. But processing in reversed order may not be the same as processing in reverse topological order. Wait, no. Kahn's algorithm produces a topological order where parents come before children. So reversed topological order has children come before parents. So when processing in reversed order, each node is processed after its children.

Thus, for each u in reversed_topo_order:

   For each v in adj[u], which is a child, since u comes after v in the reversed topological order (assuming the original topological order is parents first), then in reversed order, v is processed before u.

Wait, no. Original topological order is parents before children. Reversed topological order is children first, then parents.

So when processing in reversed order, each node is processed after all its children.

So for each u, when we process u, all v in adj[u] (children) have already been processed, so their bitmask is already calculated.

Thus, the code is correct.

Now, let's code this.

But for handling large inputs, we need to read the data efficiently.

In Python, reading input with input() and split can be slow for large m. So using sys.stdin.readline and splitting the input as needed.

But for the problem statement, the code must read from standard input via input(), but in practice, in Python, it's better to read via sys.stdin to handle large input faster.

But the user instruction says: "Your solution must read input from standard input (input()), write output to standard output (print())."

But input() in Python can be slow for 1e6 lines. So perhaps, we can read all input at once.

But for the given problem, let's proceed.

But for code submission, the code must read via input().

But for code that can handle 1e6 lines, we need to read via sys.stdin.

Wait, the user instruction says:

"Your solution must read input from standard input (input()), write output to standard output (print())."

So we must use input(), not sys.stdin.

But in Python, input() is slow. So for large inputs, this can be a problem.

But given that the problem has time limits per test (7 seconds), and Python can be slow, perhaps the code is manageable with the following optimizations:

Use sys.stdin for input.

But the problem says, "Do not include any debug prints or additional output." So the code can use sys.stdin.

Wait, the user instruction says:

"Your solution must read input from standard input (input()), write output to standard output (print())."

So, the code must use input() for reading. But that's not feasible for 1e6 lines. So perhaps, the user allows sys.stdin for reading, but the code must not include any other output.

But the problem statement says: the code must read via input() and write via print(). So in that case, we have to read via input(), but for large m, this is very slow in Python.

This might be a problem, but given the time constraints, perhaps the code can be written with sys.stdin.

But the problem says that the code must read via input(). So perhaps the code must read via input().

This is a problem for Python in handling large inputs, but given that the code is expected to be correct, perhaps the solution is written as follows.

But given the problem's constraints, perhaps the code can use the following approach to read input faster:

import sys

n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

in_degree = [0]*(n+1)

out_degree = [0]*(n+1)

for _ in range(m):

    u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())

    edges[u].append(v)

    in_degree[v] += 1

    out_degree[u] += 1

But the problem statement says that the code must read via input(). So perhaps the user's solution will use input(), but this may not pass due to time constraints. However, the code is correct algorithmically.

But given the problem's time limit is 7 seconds, perhaps in Python, even with input(), it's possible to process 1e6 lines. But in practice, it's better to use sys.stdin.

So the code will use sys.stdin to read input.

But the user instruction says that the code must read input via input(). There's a contradiction here. But the code must be written as per the user's instructions. However, in the code submission, perhaps the user expects that the code uses input(), but in reality, for Python to handle large inputs, sys.stdin is needed.

But according to the problem's instruction, the code must read via input(), so the code must use input(). But in that case, for m=1e6, the code will be too slow. But perhaps the problem's test cases are lenient.

But given that the code must be correct, perhaps proceed with the code as per the algorithm, using input().

But no, in practice, it's impossible to read 1e6 lines via input() in Python within the time limit. So the code must use sys.stdin.

Thus, the code will read via sys.stdin.

But the user instruction says to use input(). So the code must use input(). 

This is a problem, but perhaps the user's instruction is incorrect. For example, the user may allow sys.stdin. But according to the problem statement, the code must read via input().

So the code is written as:

import sys

def main():

    import sys

    from sys import stdin

    n, m = map(int, stdin.readline().split())

    adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]

    in_degree = [0]*(n+1)

    out_degree = [0]*(n+1)

    for _ in range(m):

        u, v = map(int, stdin.readline().split())

        adj[u].append(v)

        in_degree[v] += 1

        out_degree[u] += 1

    sources = [u for u in range(1, n+1) if in_degree[u] == 0]

    sinks = [u for u in range(1, n+1) if out_degree[u] == 0]

    k = len(sinks)

    # Assign indices to sinks.

    sink_indices = {u:i for i, u in enumerate(sinks)}

    # Initialize bitmask.

    bitmask = [0]*(n+1)

    for u in sinks:

        bitmask[u] = 1 << sink_indices[u]

    # Compute topological order using Kahn's algorithm.

    from collections import deque

    # Make a copy of in_degree for Kahn's algorithm.

    in_degree_kahn = in_degree.copy()

    q = deque()

    topo_order = []

    for u in sources:

        q.append(u)

    while q:

        u = q.popleft()

        topo_order.append(u)

        for v in adj[u]:

            in_degree_kahn[v] -= 1

            if in_degree_kahn[v] == 0:

                q.append(v)

    # Process in reverse topological order.

    for u in reversed(topo_order):

        for v in adj[u]:

            bitmask[u] |= bitmask[v]

    # Check each source.

    required = (1 << k) - 1

    for s in sources:

        if bitmask[s] != required:

            print("NO")

            return

    print("YES")

if __name__ == "__main__":

    main()

But wait, the in_degree_kahn is a copy of the original in_degree. Because the original in_degree was modified when reading the edges. But when we process Kahn's algorithm, we need to use the original in_degree values. So yes, in_degree_kahn is a copy of the original in_degree.

But in Python, the list.copy() method does a shallow copy, which is correct for a list of integers.

Yes.

Thus, this code should work.

Testing the first example:

Input:

3 1

1 2

The adj list for 1 is [2], in_degree is [0,0,1,0], out_degree is [0,1,0,0].

Sources are 1 and 3. Sinks are 2 and 3.

sink_indices: 2:0, 3:1.

bitmask for 2 is 1<<0=1, 3 is 1<<1=2.

Topological order:

sources are 1 and 3.

When processing the queue:

Initially, q contains 1 and 3. But wait, in_degree_kahn for 3 is 0 (since in_degree[3] is 0). So when building the queue, 1 and 3 are added.

Processing 1 first (or 3? depends on the order of the sources list).

Assuming sources are [1,3], then queue is [1,3].

Processing 1: add to topo_order. Then, process its edges to 2. in_degree_kahn[2] becomes 1-1=0. So add 2 to the queue.

Then process 3: add to topo_order. No outgoing edges.

Then process 2: add to topo_order.

So topo_order is [1,3,2].

Reversed order is [2,3,1].

Processing 2: it's a sink, bitmask is 1.

Processing 3: it's a sink, bitmask is 2.

Processing 1: its edges are to 2. OR the bitmask of 2 (1) into 1's bitmask. So 1's bitmask is 1.

Sources are 1 and 3. Their bitmask are 1 and 2. required is (1<<2)-1 =3. So 1 and 3 have 1 and 2, which sum to 3 only if combined, but each source's bitmask must be 3. So output is NO.

Which is correct.

Thus, the code works.
