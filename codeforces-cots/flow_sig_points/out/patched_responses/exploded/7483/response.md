Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So the problem is about ants moving on a circular path, and when they collide, they switch directions. But the key observation here is that the ants are indistinguishable. Because when two ants collide and switch directions, it's equivalent to them passing through each other without changing direction. So their positions over time are the same as if they just passed each other. So the main idea is that we can compute the final positions of each ant as if they never change directions, and then just sort them in the correct order based on their movement.

But wait, how does that work exactly? Let's think. Each ant is moving in their initial direction. When two collide, they swap directions, but from an outside perspective, it's like they just kept going. So the final positions after t time steps would be the same as if all ants moved through each other. So the only thing we need to do is compute where each ant would be after t units of time, assuming no collisions (so each ant continues in their original direction), and then sort those positions in the order they would appear if they had passed each other. But how does the order change?

Hmm. Let's take an example. Suppose there are two ants moving towards each other. After a collision, they switch directions. But if we imagine they just pass through each other, their positions would be swapped. So the final positions are the same as if they passed through each other. So the overall result is that the relative order of the ants is maintained as if there were no collisions, but their positions are computed as if they moved through each other.

Wait, but how to model this? Let's see. For each ant, compute their position after t time units, ignoring collisions. Then, since the collisions only affect the order in which the ants are arranged, but not their individual positions, we can model the final positions by sorting these computed positions in a way that maintains the original order of the ants' movement directions.

Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let's think again. Suppose all ants are moving in the same direction. Then there are no collisions. So their positions are straightforward. But if some are moving left (clockwise) and others right (counter-clockwise), their collisions would cause them to swap directions. But from the perspective of an observer, the labels of the ants are swapped, but their movement is as if they passed through each other.

So the key insight is that the final positions of all the ants are the same as if they all moved through each other, but the order of the ants in the output depends on the original order of their positions and directions. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of an example.

Take the first sample input:

2 ants, m=4, t=8.

Ant 1 starts at 1, direction R (counter-clockwise). So moving in counter-clockwise direction. So after 8 time units, each step increases the position by 1. So position would be 1 +8 mod 4. But since the circle is 4 units, moving counter-clockwise by 8 steps brings it back to 1. But the ant is moving right, which is counter-clockwise, right? Wait, the problem statement says that direction L is clockwise (so moving to the left in the counter-clockwise numbering), and R is counter-clockwise (so moving to the right in the numbering). So when an ant moves in direction R, their position increases by 1 each time unit (mod m). For direction L, their position decreases by 1 each time unit (mod m). Wait, positions are numbered in counter-clockwise order, so moving clockwise (L) would decrease the position. For example, if you're at position 1 and move L (clockwise), you go to position m. Then to m-1, etc.

So for the first example: ant 1 starts at 1, direction R. So after 8 units, (1 +8) mod4 = 9 mod4 =1. So position 1. Ant 2 starts at 3, direction L. So moving left (clockwise). Each step subtracts 1. So 3 -8 = -5 mod4. Let's compute that. Since m=4, -5 mod4 is 3 (since -5 + 4*2=3). Wait, wait. For mod operations, when dealing with negative numbers, adding m until it's positive. So 3 -8 = -5. -5 mod4: 4*2=8. -5 +8=3. So yes, 3 mod4 is 3. So ant 2's position is 3. So the output is 1 and 3, which matches the sample. But in this case, the ants didn't collide. Because the first sample's output is the same as if they just moved without any collisions. So maybe the collisions are not affecting the positions, but the order of the ants.

Wait, perhaps the order of the ants after all collisions is determined by the original order but adjusted based on the movement directions. So the key idea is that the final positions of the ants are the same as if they passed through each other. Then, the order of the ants along the circle is determined by their original positions and directions. But how?

Wait, suppose we have two ants moving towards each other. They will collide, swap directions, and continue. But when viewed as passing through, their positions after the collision are as if they kept moving. So the positions of all ants after t steps are the same as if there were no collisions. However, the order of the ants (the indices in the output) will be different. For example, if ant A is moving right and ant B is moving left, and they cross each other, then after the collision, ant A is moving left and B is moving right. So their positions would be the same as if they passed through each other, but the labels are swapped. But in the problem statement, the ants are labeled in the order they were given in the input, and the output needs to return their positions in that same order. So how can we model this label swapping?

Ah, here's the key: when ants collide, their labels effectively swap. So the final positions are determined by moving as if there's no collision, but the order of the ants along the circle (as per their original movement directions) is maintained. So, the correct approach is:

1. For each ant, compute the position after t units of time, ignoring collisions. Let's call this the 'virtual' position.

2. Then, determine the order in which these virtual positions appear when considering the ants' original movement. The idea is that when two ants pass each other (due to collisions), their virtual positions are swapped in the order. So, the final output is a permutation of the virtual positions, but which permutation?

The solution is to realize that the ants' movement directions affect the order in which their virtual positions are arranged. For example, ants moving to the right (R) will, after collisions, end up in positions that are ahead of their original direction. So the order of the ants in the output is determined by the initial positions and their directions, but sorted in a way that accounts for their movement.

Wait, here's a more concrete approach:

Each ant's virtual position is computed as (s_i + t * direction) mod m for R, or (s_i - t * direction) mod m. For direction R, direction is +1, for L, it's -1.

Once all these virtual positions are computed, the final positions of the ants are these virtual positions. However, the order in which the ants' virtual positions are arranged along the circle depends on their original movement. But how does this affect the order of the ants in the output?

Wait, perhaps the order of the ants after collision is such that their relative positions are the same as the virtual positions, but sorted in a way that considers their original movement. For example, the ants that are moving right (R) will end up in positions that are ordered in a certain way. Wait, maybe this is a standard approach where the virtual positions are sorted in a certain order, and that sorted order is the same as the original order of the ants' positions and directions.

Alternatively, since the ants are moving, their virtual positions are fixed, but the order of the ants along the circle after t units is determined by their original movement. Let me try to model this.

Let's think of the ants' movement as if they pass through each other, so their virtual positions are correct. The problem is that the output expects the i-th ant's final position, which is the virtual position of some ant (maybe not the original i-th one). So when collisions happen, the ants' indices are effectively swapped. But how to track which virtual position corresponds to which original ant.

The key insight here is that the ants' order when sorted by their virtual positions (adjusted for their direction) gives the same order as the original sorted positions. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think of an example.

Suppose we have two ants moving towards each other. Let's say ant 1 is at position 1, moving R (so virtual position after t=1 is 2). Ant 2 is at position 3, moving L (so virtual position after t=1 is 2). So they collide. After collision, ant 1 is moving L, ant 2 is moving R. So after the collision, their positions are 2 (ant1 moving left, ant2 moving right). After another time step, ant1 moves to 1, ant2 moves to 3. So the final positions are back to original positions. But according to virtual positions (ignoring collision), ant1 would be at 1+2=3 (if t=2), ant2 would be 3-2=1. So their virtual positions after t=2 are 3 and 1. So the output would be 3 and 1, but in the actual scenario, they end up back at their original positions. So this contradicts the initial idea. So the initial approach is wrong.

Hmm, that's a problem. So the virtual positions approach would give positions 3 and 1, but the actual positions are 1 and 3. So how to resolve this?

So in this case, the ants collide, swap directions, and then their positions after t=2 are 1 and 3, same as original. But the virtual positions would be 1+2=3 (mod m=4, assuming m=4?), and 3-2=1. So the virtual positions are 3 and 1. So the actual output would be 1 and 3, but the virtual positions are 3 and 1. So the order is swapped. So the conclusion is that the virtual positions are correct, but the order in which the ants are placed is different.

So in this case, the ants' virtual positions are swapped. So the problem is to find a way to compute the order of the ants' virtual positions based on their original positions and directions.

Another approach is needed. Let's think differently. Suppose that after all collisions, the ants' positions are as if they passed through each other. So each ant's position is s_i + d_i * t (mod m), where d_i is +1 for R, -1 for L. However, the order of the ants in the output is determined by their original positions and directions. Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe the order of the ants after t steps is the same as the order of the virtual positions, but with the direction taken into account. For example, ants moving R will, after collisions, have their positions sorted in a way that their virtual positions are ordered, but in a way that takes into account their initial direction. So perhaps the ants moving R will have their virtual positions sorted in a certain way, and ants moving L in another.

Alternatively, here's a method from competitive programming problems I've seen before. The key idea is that when two ants collide and turn around, it's equivalent to them passing through each other but retaining their directions. Thus, the final positions of all ants are the same as if they all walked through each other, but their labels are swapped. But since the problem requires the labels (the order in the input) to be maintained, we need to track which ant ends up where.

Wait, but how can this be modeled? For example, if two ants pass through each other, their labels are swapped. So after t time, the label of each ant is determined by how many times they have passed through other ants.

Wait, perhaps the number of times an ant passes through other ants (i.e., collides) is equal to the number of ants moving in the opposite direction that they cross. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ants can be considered in the initial order sorted by their positions. Then, after collisions, the order of the ants changes based on their movement directions. For example, if two ants are moving towards each other, they will swap positions. But since all collisions are equivalent to passing through, the order of the ants after t time can be determined by their movement direction and the order of their virtual positions.

But how?

Another approach: Let's model the problem by considering that each ant has a certain 'virtual' position, which is their position after moving for t time without collisions. The final positions are these virtual positions. However, the order of the ants in the output is determined by the original order of their movement directions and virtual positions.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Compute the virtual positions for all ants as if they didn't collide.

- Sort the ants by their virtual positions. However, the order in which they are sorted depends on their directions. For example, ants moving right (R) will have their virtual positions ordered in a certain way, and left-moving ants in another. Then, the sorted order of the ants' virtual positions will correspond to the original order of their positions, adjusted for direction.

Alternatively, here's a more concrete step-by-step approach from some online resources (since this is a classic problem):

The key idea is that after all collisions, the final positions of the ants are the same as if they had passed through each other. However, the order of the ants in the output depends on their movement directions.

So, for each ant, compute their virtual position (s_i + t * direction) mod m. Then, the problem reduces to determining the order of these virtual positions such that the original order of the ants is maintained in a way that accounts for their directions.

To model this, the approach is:

1. For each ant, compute their virtual position.

2. Sort the ants' virtual positions in the order they would appear on the circle, taking into account their original movement directions. But how?

Wait, think of the ants as moving either clockwise or counter-clockwise. For ants moving counter-clockwise (R), their virtual positions will be s_i + t mod m. For ants moving clockwise (L), s_i - t mod m.

Once all virtual positions are computed, we can sort the ants in the same order as their virtual positions. But the original ants' order is determined by their initial positions and directions. Wait, perhaps this is not the case.

Alternatively, consider that when ants pass through each other, their labels are swapped. So, the relative order of the ants moving in the same direction remains the same, but ants moving in opposite directions will have their order changed as they pass each other.

But how to track this?

An alternative approach from some references suggests that the ants can be considered as moving through each other, and their final positions are the virtual positions. The order of the ants (as per their indices) can be determined by considering their initial positions and directions, and how their movement affects their positions relative to others.

For example, suppose we have two ants A and B, with A initially to the left of B. If A is moving R and B is moving L, then after some time, they will pass each other, causing their labels to swap. However, their virtual positions would have A to the right of B. So in the sorted list of virtual positions, A and B are in swapped order compared to the original. But the output must preserve the original index order, so how to map the virtual positions back to the original indices.

This seems complex, but there's a mathematical way to model it. The idea is to compute the virtual positions for each ant, and then sort the virtual positions, but the order in which they are sorted depends on the ants' movement directions.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

1. For each ant, compute the virtual position (s_i + t * dir_i) mod m, where dir_i is +1 for R and -1 for L.

2. Sort the ants based on their virtual positions.

3. The order of the ants in the sorted list corresponds to the order they would be in after t time units, considering that they passed through each other. However, the original indices are not preserved. So how to map the sorted virtual positions to the original indices.

But how to determine which ant's virtual position corresponds to which original index.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the relative order of the ants moving in the same direction is preserved. For example, if two ants are moving R, their order relative to each other remains the same. Similarly for ants moving L. But when ants are moving in opposite directions, their order can change.

Alternatively, here's a method that works:

Each ant's virtual position is computed. Then, all ants are sorted by their virtual positions. However, the original indices of the ants are determined by their movement direction. For example, ants moving R will have their order in the sorted list determined by their initial positions plus t (mod m), and ants moving L by initial positions minus t (mod m). But how does this affect the final output order.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to realize that the ants' final order is determined by their virtual positions, but their original directions determine how their positions are sorted. So, for example, if two ants have the same virtual position, but different directions, their order would depend on their directions.

But that's not helpful. Let's think of the first example again. The two ants' virtual positions are 1 and 3. So sorted in order, they are 1 and 3. But the output is 1 3. Which matches. So in this case, the order of the sorted virtual positions matches the original input order.

Another example: when two ants collide, their virtual positions are swapped. So in the example I mentioned earlier where t=2 and m=4, the virtual positions are 3 and 1. So sorted by virtual positions, the order is 1,3. The original ants' order is 1 and 2. So the output would be 3 and 1, but in reality, the ants return to their original positions. Wait, but that's a contradiction. So maybe the initial approach is not correct.

This suggests that the problem is more complex than just computing virtual positions and sorting them.

Alternative approach: Let's model the movement of the ants and their collisions.

When two ants collide, they swap directions. But since the collision is instantaneous, their positions are the same. So after the collision, their directions are reversed. However, from the perspective of the circle, the ants' movement can be considered as passing through each other. But this only affects their directions. However, the final positions after t units would be the same as if the ants passed through each other. So the positions are correct, but the order of the ants (as per their indices) is not.

Wait, but how do the indices get mapped after collisions. For example, if ant A and ant B collide, then after the collision, they swap directions. So, from that point on, ant A is moving in B's original direction, and vice versa.

But when considering all collisions, the ants' indices are effectively permuted. The problem is to track which original ant ends up at which virtual position.

This seems challenging. But perhaps there's a mathematical way to compute the permutation.

Let's consider that the ants are moving along a circle. Each ant's movement is determined by their direction and time. Collisions cause direction swaps, but the overall effect on the positions is equivalent to the ants passing through each other. So the final positions are the same as if they passed through, but the permutation of the indices depends on the number of collisions each ant has experienced.

But how to model this permutation.

Wait, here's an alternative approach inspired by some solutions I've seen for similar problems:

The idea is that after all collisions, the order of the ants moving in the same direction is preserved, but ants moving in opposite directions are interleaved in a way that depends on their movement.

For example, all ants moving right (R) will, after collisions, have their positions determined by their initial positions plus t. But their order in the final output is determined by their initial positions and the number of ants moving left (L) that they pass.

Similarly, ants moving left will have their positions as initial minus t.

But how does the number of L ants passed affect their order.

Alternatively, the order of the ants after t time is determined by their initial positions and directions. For example, for each ant, we can compute how many other ants moving in the opposite direction they have passed. This count will determine how their index is shifted in the final array.

But how?

Let's think: each ant moving R will pass any L ants that are in their path. Each such pass swaps their indices. So for an ant moving R, the number of L ants that it passes is equal to the number of L ants that are initially in front of it (in the R direction) but end up behind it after t time.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's try to model this.

For each ant i moving R (direction +1):

The number of ants moving L that i would pass in time t is equal to the number of ants j moving L where j's initial position is in (s_i, s_i + t) mod m, and j's virtual position (s_j - t) mod m is in (s_i, s_i + t) mod m.

But this seems difficult to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of collisions an ant i experiences is equal to the number of ants moving in the opposite direction that cross paths with i during t time units.

But even that is hard to compute.

Alternative approach inspired by the fact that after collisions, the ants' labels are permuted as if they passed through each other. So the permutation of the labels can be determined by the number of ants moving in the opposite direction that each ant passes.

For example, for each ant moving R, the number of L ants that start in positions such that when they move L, they would cross the R-moving ant's path. Each such crossing corresponds to a collision, which swaps the labels. But since each collision swaps the labels, the net effect is that the R-moving ant's label is shifted by the number of L ants that it has passed.

Wait, suppose an ant i is moving R. The number of L ants that are initially between s_i and s_i + t (mod m) is the number of ants j where (s_j is in (s_i, s_i + t) mod m) and moving L. Then, each such j would have a virtual position of s_j - t mod m. But how does this affect the order.

Alternatively, for each ant i moving R, the number of L ants that i overtakes (or is overtaken by) in time t is the number of L ants whose initial positions are in the interval [s_i, s_i + t) mod m. Similarly, for each ant j moving L, the number of R ants that j overtakes is the number of R ants in [s_j - t, s_j) mod m.

Then, the permutation for the ants is such that each R ant's final index is shifted by the number of L ants it has passed, and each L ant's final index is shifted by the number of R ants it has passed.

But how to model this.

Suppose we have all ants moving R. Then, their order in the virtual positions is the same as their initial order, but shifted by their movement. Since they are moving in the same direction, there are no collisions, so their order is preserved.

Similarly, ants moving L: their order is reversed in terms of their initial positions, since they are moving in the opposite direction.

But when there are ants moving in both directions, their collisions cause their indices to swap. The total number of swaps (collisions) for an ant is the number of ants in the opposite direction that they pass through.

So for an ant i moving R:

The number of L ants that are in the interval (s_i, s_i + t) mod m.

Each such L ant j will cross i once. Each crossing swaps the indices of i and j. So, the total shift for i is the number of L ants that i passes.

Wait, but when two ants cross, they swap indices. So for each such L ant that i passes, the index of i increases by 1 (if the L ants are in a certain order). Hmm.

Alternatively, imagine that all R ants are initially sorted in their order, and all L ants are sorted in their order. Then, the collision count for each R ant is the number of L ants that are in their path. Each such collision swaps the R ant's index with the L ant's index. But this is not straightforward.

This is getting quite complicated. Perhaps there's a smarter way to model this.

Another approach: for each ant, after moving for t time, their position is the same as if they passed through other ants. So the final positions are correct. The problem is to determine the permutation that maps the initial indices to the final positions.

The key insight is that the permutation depends on the number of ants moving in the opposite direction that each ant has passed. So for each ant i moving R, the number of L ants that i has passed is equal to the number of L ants whose initial positions are in the interval (s_i, s_i + t) mod m. Similarly for L ants.

Once we can compute this count, the permutation can be determined.

Once the permutation is determined, we can apply it to the virtual positions to get the correct output.

So the steps are:

1. Compute virtual positions for each ant.

2. Compute for each ant the number of opposite-direction ants that it has passed.

3. The final index of each ant is its initial index plus (for R) or minus (for L) the count.

But how to handle the modulo and the circular nature.

Alternatively, perhaps the ants can be partitioned into two groups: R and L.

Compute for each R ant i, the number of L ants j where j's initial position is in the interval (s_i, s_i + t) mod m. This can be done by sorting the L ants' initial positions and performing a binary search.

Similarly, for each L ant j, compute the number of R ants i where i's initial position is in (s_j - t, s_j) mod m.

Then, the shift for R ants i is the number of L ants j that they pass. The shift for L ants j is the number of R ants i that they pass.

Then, the final index of each ant is:

For R ants: (original index) + number of L passed.

For L ants: (original index) - number of R passed.

But how to manage the indices when there are overlapping shifts.

Wait, perhaps the ants are sorted in the order of their virtual positions, and then their indices are shifted based on the count of opposite ants passed. Then, the final positions can be ordered accordingly.

But this is still unclear.

Let's think of the first sample input:

Sample 1:

n=2, m=4, t=8.

Ant 1: s=1, R. Virtual position is (1 +8) mod4= 9 mod4=1.

Ant 2: s=3, L. Virtual position is (3-8) mod4= (-5) mod4=3.

So the virtual positions are [1,3]. They are in the same order as the original input. So the output is 1 3. Which matches.

Sample 2:

n=4, m=8, t=6.

Ant positions and directions:

6 R → 6+6=12 mod8=4.

5 L →5-6= -1 mod8=7.

1 R →1+6=7.

8 L →8-6=2.

Virtual positions are 4,7,7,2.

But the output is 7,4,2,7.

Hmm, but the virtual positions are 4,7,7,2. So when sorted, they are 2,4,7,7. But the output is 7,4,2,7. Which is different. So clearly, just sorting the virtual positions isn't enough.

So what's the correct approach here.

Another idea: The ants' order after t time units is determined by their virtual positions and their direction. For example, ants moving R will have their virtual positions ordered in a way that their original order is preserved, but shifted by the number of L ants they passed. Similarly for L ants.

Alternatively, after collisions, the ants' order is determined by their virtual positions, but when two ants have the same virtual position, the one that arrived there from a R direction comes after the one from L.

But this seems unclear.

Alternatively, the ants can be sorted by their virtual positions. Then, the ants moving R are ordered in the same way as their original order, and the ants moving L are ordered in reverse order. Then, combining these two groups gives the correct final order.

But how to verify this.

Sample 2:

Virtual positions:

Ant1:6 R →6+6=12 mod8=4.

Ant2:5 L →5-6= -1 mod8=7.

Ant3:1 R →1+6=7 mod8=7.

Ant4:8 L →8-6=2 mod8=2.

So virtual positions are 4 (R),7 (L),7 (R), 2 (L).

So sorted virtual positions would be 2,4,7,7.

The ants in sorted order are:

Ant4 (2, L), Ant1 (4, R), Ant2 (7, L), Ant3 (7, R).

But the output is 7,4,2,7. Which for the original ants is:

Ant1's output is 7, Ant2's is4, Ant3's is2, Ant4's is7. But that doesn't match.

Wait, the actual output for sample2 is 7 4 2 7. The input order was:

Ant1:6 R → virtual 4.

Ant2:5 L → virtual7.

Ant3:1 R → virtual7.

Ant4:8 L → virtual2.

The output is Ant1 →7, Ant2 →4, Ant3→2, Ant4→7.

Wait, this suggests that the final positions are 7 (Ant1), 4 (Ant2), 2 (Ant3),7 (Ant4). But how does that relate to their virtual positions.

This is confusing. So perhaps the correct approach is not just to compute the virtual positions and sort them.

Alternative approach: The order of the ants in the output is determined by their original positions and directions, but adjusted for the number of times they have passed other ants.

But how to compute this.

Another idea: the ants moving R will, after collisions, end up in positions that are (s_i + t) mod m. The ants moving L will be in (s_i - t) mod m. The final order of the ants is determined by the order of their virtual positions, but for ants with the same virtual position, the R ants are ordered after the L ants.

But sample2 shows ants with virtual positions 7 (Ant2 is L, virtual7) and 7 (Ant3 is R, virtual7). The output for Ant2 is 4 and Ant3 is 2, which doesn't fit this model.

Hmm. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Alternative approach inspired by the fact that the ants' positions are determined by their virtual positions, but the order of the ants in the output is determined by the following steps:

1. Compute the virtual positions for all ants.

2. Sort the ants based on their virtual positions. For ants with the same virtual position, the one moving R comes after the one moving L.

3. Then, for each ant in the sorted list, their index in the output is determined by their original index plus the number of ants of opposite direction they have passed.

But this is not clear.

Alternatively, here's a method I recall from similar problems:

The final positions are the virtual positions, but the order of the ants in the output is determined by the original order of their initial positions, but sorted by their virtual positions and then grouped by their direction.

Wait, perhaps the following steps:

- For each ant, compute virtual position.

- Sort the ants' virtual positions, but when two ants have the same virtual position, the one moving L comes first.

- Then, the order of the ants in the output is the sorted order of the virtual positions, and the indices in the output are assigned based on the sorted order.

But this doesn't take into account the original order of the input.

Sample 1:

Ant1: virtual 1 (R), Ant2: virtual 3 (L). Sorted by virtual position (1,3). Since no duplicates, output order is same as sorted. Which matches sample output.

Sample 2:

Ant4's virtual is 2 (L), Ant1's is4 (R), Ant2's is7 (L), Ant3's is7 (R). Sorted order is 2 (Ant4),4 (Ant1),7 (Ant2),7 (Ant3). So output order would be 2,4,7,7. But the actual output is 7,4,2,7.

So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. This suggests that there's a different way to sort the ants.

Alternative approach inspired by the fact that the ants' movement directions determine the order of their virtual positions. For example:

- All ants moving R will have their virtual positions in the same order as their initial positions, shifted by t.

- All ants moving L will have their virtual positions in the reverse order of their initial positions, shifted by t.

Then, the final order of the ants is the merged list of R ants (ordered as initial) and L ants (ordered in reverse initial), sorted by virtual positions.

But how?

Alternatively, for R ants, their order after t time is the same as their initial order. For L ants, their order after t time is the reverse of their initial order. Then, when merged, the R and L ants' virtual positions are sorted, but within the same direction, the order is preserved.

So for example, in sample2:

R ants are Ant1 and Ant3. Their initial positions are 6 and 1. So after t=6, their virtual positions are 4 and7. The initial order of R ants is Ant1 (6) then Ant3 (1). So in the final order, R ants are sorted by virtual positions (4 and7), but in their initial order. Wait, no. How does this work.

Alternatively, for R ants, their order after t time is the same as their order in virtual positions. But for L ants, their order after t time is the reverse of their virtual positions.

So for sample2:

R ants have virtual positions 4 (Ant1) and7 (Ant3). L ants have virtual positions7 (Ant2) and 2 (Ant4). 

For R ants, sorted by virtual positions:4,7. So order is Ant1, Ant3.

For L ants, sorted by virtual positions in reverse:7,2. So ordered Ant2, Ant4.

Then merged list is 4,7,7,2. Which would be ordered as 2,4,7,7. But sample2's output is7,4,2,7. So this doesn't match.

Hmm.

This is getting really complicated. Perhaps I should look for a pattern or mathematical model that can help.

Another idea: When ants collide, their labels swap. So the total number of times two ants collide is equal to the number of pairs of ants moving towards each other that cross paths in time t.

But how does this affect the final index of each ant.

For example, if an ant i moving R collides with k ants moving L, then its final index is the original index plus k. Because each collision swaps the label with the L ant. So after k collisions, the ant's index is shifted by k.

Similarly, an ant j moving L collides with h ants moving R, so its index is shifted by h.

But how to compute k and h for each ant.

For an ant i moving R, the number of collisions is equal to the number of L ants j such that (s_j is in (s_i, s_i + t) mod m) and j is moving L. Because these ants will cross paths with i during the t time units.

So the steps would be:

1. For all R ants, compute the number of L ants in the interval (s_i, s_i + t) mod m.

2. For all L ants, compute the number of R ants in the interval (s_j -t, s_j) mod m.

3. For each ant, the index in the output is:

   - if R: original index + number of L ants passed.

   - if L: original index - number of R ants passed.

Then, the final positions are sorted by virtual positions, but the indices are assigned based on the shifts.

Wait, but how to model this.

Let's see sample2:

Ant1: R, original index 0 (assuming 0-based), virtual position 4.

Ant2: L, original index 1, virtual position7.

Ant3: R, original index 2, virtual position7.

Ant4: L, original index3, virtual position2.

The ants are in the input order: 0,1,2,3.

Now compute for each R ant the number of L ants passed.

Ant1 (R) is at s=6, t=6. The interval is (6, 6+6=12) mod8. 12 mod8 is4, so the interval is from6+1 to4 in mod8, which is7,0,1,2,3,4. So the L ants in this interval are ants4 (s=8 mod8 is0?), wait, original s_j for L ants are 5 (Ant2),8 (Ant4).

Wait, Ant4's initial position is8, but m=8. So 8 mod8 is0. So s_j for Ant4 is0.

So the interval for Ant1 (R) is (6,6+6=12 mod8=4). So in the circle, the interval is 6 →7 →0 →1 →2 →3 →4. So any L ants with s_j in (6,4) mod8.

But how to model intervals on a circular m.

The interval (a, b) mod m is all positions x where a <x <b in the circular sense. So for a=6 and b=4 (since 6+6=12 mod8=4), the interval (6,4) is the positions from7,0,1,2,3.

So the L ants in this interval are Ant4 (s=8 mod8=0) and Ant2 (s=5, which is not in the interval (6,4) because 5 <6).

So Ant1's passed L ants are Ant4. So count is1. So Ant1's new index is0 +1=1.

Ant3 (R) has s=1, t=6. Virtual position is7. The interval is (1,7) mod8 (1+6=7). The interval is 2,3,4,5,6. The L ants in this interval are Ant2 (s=5). So count is1. So Ant3's new index is2 +1=3.

For L ants:

Ant2 (s=5) has interval (5-6= -1 mod8=7,5). So interval is7,0,1,2,3,4. The R ants in this interval are Ant1 (s=6) and Ant3 (s=1). So count is2. So new index is1-2= -1 mod4? No, perhaps the indices are 0-based, and the shifting is done modulo n.

Wait, this approach may not handle negative indices properly.

Alternatively, for each L ant j, the number of R ants passed is the number of R ants whose s_i is in (s_j -t, s_j) mod m.

Ant2 (s=5) has s_j -t =5-6= -1 mod8=7. So interval (7,5) mod8 is7,0,1,2,3,4. R ants in this interval are Ant1 (s=6), Ant3 (s=1). So count is2. So new index is1 -2= -1. But in 0-based indices, -1 mod4=3.

Ant4 (s=8 mod8=0) has s_j -t=0-6= -6 mod8=2. Interval (2,0) mod8 is3,4,5,6,7,0. R ants in this interval are Ant1 (s=6) and Ant3 (s=1 is not in the interval (2,0)). So count is1. So new index is3 -1=2.

So the new indices are:

Ant0 (R):1.

Ant1 (L):3.

Ant2 (R):3.

Ant3 (L):2.

The new indices are [1,3,3,2]. But how does this correspond to the output order.

The virtual positions are [4,7,7,2]. So the sorted virtual positions are2,4,7,7.

The ants in sorted order are:

Ant3 (2), Ant0 (4), Ant1 (7), Ant2 (7).

Their new indices are 2,0,3,3.

But how to map this to the output.

The output is supposed to be the original ant indices in order, but their new positions are determined by their new indices.

Wait, perhaps the new indices are the positions in the output array. For example:

original indices are 0,1,2,3.

After shifting, their new indices are:

0 →1.

1 →3.

2 →3.

3 →2.

So the output array is filled as follows:

output[0] = ant whose new index is 0: none.

Wait, this seems to have a problem. Perhaps the approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the output order is the new indices. For example:

Each ant's new index is computed as original index + number of L passed (for R) or original index - number of R passed (for L). Then, the ants are ordered by their new indices.

But sample2's output is7,4,2,7.

In the sample2, the new indices are:

Ant0:1.

Ant1:3.

Ant2:3.

Ant3:2.

So sorted by new indices: 1 (Ant0), 2 (Ant3),3 (Ant1 and Ant2).

But how to order ants with the same new index.

This is getting too confusing. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Let's consider all ants' virtual positions and their directions. Then, sort the ants first by their virtual positions. If two ants have the same virtual position, the one with R direction comes after the L direction. Then, the order of the ants in the output is determined by this sorted order. But how does this account for the collisions.

Sample2's sorted order would be:

Ant3 (virtual2, L), Ant0 (virtual4, R), Ant1 (virtual7, L), Ant2 (virtual7, R).

So sorted list is [Ant3, Ant0, Ant1, Ant2]. Their virtual positions are 2,4,7,7.

The output is7,4,2,7. Which corresponds to Ant1, Ant0, Ant3, Ant2's virtual positions. So this doesn't match.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a solution approach that others have used for similar problems.

After some research, I found that this problem can be solved with the following approach:

Each ant's final position is (s_i + d_i * t) mod m, where d_i is +1 for R, -1 for L. However, the order of the ants in the output is determined by the number of collisions they've had, which is equivalent to the number of ants moving in the opposite direction that they have passed.

The key insight is that the ants' labels can be determined by considering the number of ants moving in the opposite direction that each ant has passed. The steps are:

1. Compute the virtual positions for all ants.

2. For each ant, compute the number of ants of the opposite direction that they would have passed during time t.

3. The new index for each ant is determined by their original index plus (for R) or minus (for L) the count of passed ants.

4. Sort the ants by their virtual positions and assign their new indices.

But how to implement this.

Let's think of ants as being sorted by their virtual positions. Then, the ants' new indices are determined by their original order and the count of passed ants.

For example, for R ants:

The number of L ants passed is the number of L ants whose initial positions are in the interval (s_i, s_i + t) mod m.

Similarly, for L ants, the number of R ants passed is the number of R ants whose initial positions are in the interval (s_j -t, s_j) mod m.

So to compute these counts, we can:

- Separate the ants into R and L groups.

- Sort the R and L groups by their positions.

- For each R ant, use binary search to count the number of L ants in the interval (s_i, s_i + t mod m).

- For each L ant, use binary search to count the number of R ants in the interval (s_j -t mod m, s_j).

But how to handle the circular nature of the intervals.

Once these counts are computed, each R ant's new index is original index + count.

Each L ant's new index is original index - count.

But the new indices must be modulo n to handle wrapping around.

Once all ants' new indices are computed, we can create an array where each entry is the virtual position of the ant at the new index.

Finally, the output is the array of virtual positions ordered according to the new indices.

But how to handle this.

Alternatively, after computing the new indices, we can create a list where for each new index, we place the virtual position of the corresponding ant.

But since new indices may overlap or be out of order, this approach may require adjusting for the modulo.

But perhaps the correct way is:

- Each ant's new index is determined as (original index + count) mod n for R ants, or (original index - count) mod n for L ants.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the ants are sorted by their virtual positions. Then, the order of the sorted list is the same as the order of the ants after t time units, but the mapping from the original ants to the sorted list is determined by the counts.

But I'm still not sure.

At this point, perhaps the best way to proceed is to look for an implementation that correctly handles the virtual positions and the count of passed ants.

The steps for the solution are:

1. For each ant, compute their virtual position.

2. Compute for each R ant the number of L ants that are in the interval (s_i, s_i + t) mod m.

3. Compute for each L ant the number of R ants that are in the interval (s_j - t, s_j) mod m.

4. For each R ant, their new index is (original index + number of L passed) mod n.

5. For each L ant, their new index is (original index - number of R passed) mod n.

6. Create an array where each element is the virtual position of the ant whose new index is the array's index.

7. Output this array in order.

But this may not be correct. Let's test sample2.

Sample2:

Ant0: R, virtual4, original index0.

Ant1: L, virtual7, original index1.

Ant2: R, virtual7, original index2.

Ant3: L, virtual2, original index3.

For R ants:

Ant0's interval is (6, (6+6) mod8=4). So in the circle, this is (6,4), which covers positions7,0,1,2,3. The L ants in this interval are Ant3 (s=0) and Ant1 (s=5? Wait, no. Ant1's s is5, which is in the original positions. But mod8, 5 is5, which is not in the interval (6,4). So only Ant3's s=0 is in the interval. So count for Ant0 is1. So new index is0+1=1.

Ant2's s=1. Interval is (1,1+6=7 mod8). So positions2,3,4,5,6. L ants in this interval are none. So count is0. new index is2+0=2.

For L ants:

Ant1's s=5. interval is (5-6= -1 mod8=7,5). This covers positions7,0,1,2,3,4. R ants in this interval are Ant0 (s=6 mod8=6?), wait s=6 is in the interval? No, because the interval is (7,5), which is positions7,0,1,2,3,4. R ants in this interval are Ant0 (s=6) is not in the interval. Ant2's s=1 is in the interval. So count is1. So new index is1-1=0.

Ant3's s=0. interval is (0-6= -6 mod8=2,0). So interval (2,0) which covers positions3,4,5,6,7. R ants in this interval are Ant0 (s=6) and Ant2 (s=1 is not in the interval). So count is1. new index is3-1=2.

So new indices:

Ant0:1.

Ant1:0.

Ant2:2.

Ant3:2.

So the array is:

index 0: Ant1's virtual7.

index1: Ant0's virtual4.

index2: Ant2's virtual7 and Ant3's virtual2.

But this is impossible since indices must be unique. So this approach is flawed.

Clearly, this approach is not correct.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to find a different way.

Another idea: since collisions between ants only swap their directions, the final order of the ants can be determined by their virtual positions and their original directions. For example, when two ants collide, their positions are the same, but their directions are reversed. However, their virtual positions are different. So the actual positions after t time would be the same as if they passed through each other, but their directions are swapped.

But the problem only requires the final positions, not directions. So perhaps the final positions are the same as the virtual positions. But the order in which the ants are output depends on the number of collisions each has undergone.

But how to model this.

After some research, I found that the correct approach is:

1. Compute the virtual positions for all ants.

2. For each ant, compute how many times they have passed ants of the opposite direction. This count is the number of collisions.

3. The order of the ants in the output is determined by their virtual positions, but ants that moved R have their original order plus the collision count, and ants that moved L have their original order minus the collision count.

But this is still unclear.

The correct approach seems to be:

- Compute the virtual positions for all ants.

- For each ant, compute the number of ants of the opposite direction that they have passed.

- The ants are then sorted by their virtual positions. For ants with the same virtual position, the one moving R comes after the one moving L.

- The final output order is this sorted list, but the ants are assigned to the output based on their original indices shifted by the collision count.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, after computing the virtual positions and collision counts, the ants' indices in the output array are determined by their original indices plus or minus the collision count, modulo n.

But how to handle overlapping indices.

At this point, I think I need to refer to the solution for this problem.

After some research, I found that the correct approach is to:

- Compute for each ant their virtual position.

- Compute for each ant the number of ants of the opposite direction that they would have passed. This is the number of ants of opposite direction in the interval determined by their movement.

- The ants are then sorted by their virtual positions, and their original indices are shifted based on the collision count.

- The final positions are the virtual positions in this shifted order.

But the exact steps for shifting are not clear.

Another approach found in some solutions is:

For each ant, their final position is the virtual position. The order of the ants in the output is determined by sorting the ants as follows:

- Sort the ants by their virtual positions.

- If two ants have the same virtual position, the one with direction R comes after the one with L.

- The order of the ants in the sorted list is the same as the order of their original indices after adjusting for the number of collisions.

But how to adjust.

The key realization is that ants moving in opposite directions will cross each other, and each crossing swaps their indices. The number of such swaps for an ant is equal to the number of opposite-direction ants they have passed.

Thus, the final order of the ants is:

- For R ants: their original order plus the number of L ants they have passed.

- For L ants: their original order minus the number of R ants they have passed.

Once these values are computed, the ants are sorted by their virtual positions, and their new indices are determined by the adjusted order.

But how to implement this.

The correct steps are:

1. Compute virtual positions for all ants.

2. Separate the ants into R and L groups.

3. Sort the R group and L group by their positions.

4. For each R ant, count the number of L ants in the interval (s_i, s_i + t) mod m. This can be done using binary search on the sorted L positions.

5. For each L ant, count the number of R ants in the interval (s_j -t, s_j) mod m. This can be done using binary search on the sorted R positions.

6. For each ant, compute the new index based on their original index and the collision count.

7. Create an array where the new indices are filled with the virtual positions.

But this is still not clear.

Sample2:

Original indices:

0: R, s=6, virtual4.

1: L, s=5, virtual7.

2: R, s=1, virtual7.

3: L, s=8, virtual2.

R group sorted by s: s=1 (index2), s=6 (index0).

L group sorted by s: s=5 (index1), s=8 (index3).

For R ants:

Ant0 (s=6, R):

Interval is (6,6+6=12 mod8=4) → which is positions7,0,1,2,3.

In L group, find ants with s_j in this interval. L ants are s=5 and s=8 (which is 0). So s=0 is in the interval. So count is1.

Ant0's new index is0 +1 =1.

Ant2 (s=1, R):

Interval is (1,1+6=7) → positions2,3,4,5,6.

L ants are s=5 is in this interval. So count is1.

Ant2's new index is2+1=3.

For L ants:

Ant1 (s=5, L):

Interval is (5-6= -1 mod8=7,5) → positions7,0,1,2,3,4.

R ants in R group sorted by s: s=1 and 6.

Which R ants are in this interval? s=1 is in (7,5) mod8? No, 7 < s=1 <5 is not possible. Wait, the interval (7,5) mod8 is from7 to5, which is all positions except 5,6. So s=1 is in the interval. s=6 is not. So count is1.

Ant1's new index is1 -1=0.

Ant3 (s=8 mod8=0, L):

Interval is (0-6= -6 mod8=2,0) → positions3,4,5,6,7,0.

R ants in R group are s=1 and6. s=6 is in the interval. So count is1.

Ant3's new index is3-1=2.

Now, the new indices are:

Ant0:1.

Ant1:0.

Ant2:3.

Ant3:2.

The ants' virtual positions are:

Ant0:4.

Ant1:7.

Ant2:7.

Ant3:2.

So the output array is:

index0: Ant1's7.

index1: Ant0's4.

index2: Ant3's2.

index3: Ant2's7.

Which gives the output7 4 2 7, which matches the sample.

Yes! This works.

So the correct approach is:

For each ant:

- If direction is R, compute the number of L ants that are in the interval (s_i, s_i + t) mod m.

- For L ants, compute the number of R ants in the interval (s_j -t, s_j) mod m.

- For R ants, new_index = original_index + count.

- For L ants, new_index = original_index - count.

The new indices are mod n (but in sample2, n=4, new indices are within 0-3).

Then, create an array of size n, where for each new_index, the ant's virtual position is placed.

Finally, output the array in order.

So the steps are:

1. Read all ants, store their positions, directions, and original indices.

2. Separate R and L ants.

3. Sort R ants by their s, sort L ants by their s.

4. For each R ant i:

   a. Compute s_i + t mod m to get the end of the interval.

   b. Determine the interval (s_i, s_i + t mod m) on the circle.

   c. Count the number of L ants in this interval using binary search.

5. For each L ant j:

   a. Compute s_j - t mod m to get the start of the interval.

   b. Determine the interval (s_j -t mod m, s_j) on the circle.

   c. Count the number of R ants in this interval using binary search.

6. For each ant, compute new_index based on direction and count.

7. Create an output array where output[new_index] = virtual position.

8. Print the output array.

Now, the key is to correctly compute the intervals and count the number of opposite ants in those intervals.

To handle the circular nature of the interval, we can split into two cases:

- If the interval is a normal range (start < end), then check if an ant's s is in (start, end).

- If the interval wraps around (start > end), then check if s is in (start, m) or (0, end).

But binary search can be tricky. However, by sorting the opposite ants' positions, we can use binary search to count the number of positions in the interval.

But for the R ants' intervals, which are (s_i, s_i +t) mod m, which is (s_i, e_i), where e_i = (s_i + t) % m.

If s_i < e_i: the interval is s_i < x < e_i.

If s_i > e_i: the interval is x > s_i or x < e_i.

For L ants' intervals, which are (s_j -t mod m, s_j) mod m. Let s_start = (s_j -t) % m. The interval is (s_start, s_j).

If s_start < s_j: interval is s_start < x < s_j.

Else: x > s_start or x < s_j.

So for each R ant i, we need to find the number of L ants whose s is in (s_i, e_i) when s_i < e_i, or in (s_i, m) or (0, e_i) when s_i > e_i.

But since the L ants' positions are sorted, we can use binary search to find the count.

Similarly for L ants.

So here's the plan:

For R ants:

Compute e_i = (s_i + t) % m.

If s_i < e_i:

   count = number of L ants with s in (s_i, e_i).

Else:

   count = number of L ants with s > s_i or s < e_i.

For L ants:

Compute s_start = (s_j - t) % m.

If s_start < s_j:

   count = number of R ants with s in (s_start, s_j).

Else:

   count = number of R ants with s > s_start or s < s_j.

To compute these counts, since the R and L ants are sorted, we can use binary search.

So in code:

For R ants:

sorted_L = sorted of L's s.

e_i = (s_i + t) % m.

if s_i < e_i:

   count = bisect_left(sorted_L, e_i) - bisect_right(sorted_L, s_i)

else:

   count = (len(sorted_L) - bisect_right(sorted_L, s_i)) + bisect_left(sorted_L, e_i)

For L ants:

sorted_R = sorted of R's s.

s_start = (s_j - t) % m.

if s_start < s_j:

   count = bisect_left(sorted_R, s_j) - bisect_right(sorted_R, s_start)

else:

   count = (len(sorted_R) - bisect_right(sorted_R, s_start)) + bisect_left(sorted_R, s_j)

Once the counts are computed, new indices are determined.

Finally, create the output array.

Now, code.

But ants are processed in the order of input. So for each ant, we need to know whether it's R or L, compute its virtual position, compute the count, and compute new index.

But for code:

We can separate the ants into R and L groups, sort their s's, then for each ant in the input order, compute the count based on their group.

But for example, in the input order, for each ant:

if direction is R:

   compute e_i = (s + t) % m.

   find the count of L ants in interval (s, e_i).

else:

   compute s_start = (s - t) % m.

   find the count of R ants in interval (s_start, s).

Then, compute new index as original index + count (if R) or original index - count (if L).

Then, the new index can be modulo n to handle negative values.

Wait, but in sample2, Ant3's new index is 3 -1=2, which is correct.

But for L ants, if original index - count is negative, we can add n and then mod n.

So new_index = (original_index - count) % n.

For R ants, new_index = (original_index + count) % n.

Once all new indices are computed, create an array of size n, and for each ant, place their virtual position at new_index.

Finally, output the array in order.

Yes.

Now, implementing this in code.

But handling large n (up to 3e5), and t up to 1e18, this approach should be O(n log n), which is acceptable.

Now, code:

Read n, m, t.

Read each ant's s and direction. Store s, direction, and original index (0-based or 1-based? Probably 0-based since it's easier for new indices).

Separate R and L groups, collect their s's, sort them.

For each ant in the input order:

compute virtual position.

compute count of opposite ants in the required interval.

compute new_index.

then, output array[new_index] = virtual.

Finally, print the array.

But how to handle s and virtual positions:

Note that the ants' initial positions are given in the input as s_i (1 ≤ s_i ≤ m). So we need to handle them as 1-based. But when computing intervals, we need to use modulo m correctly.

But in code, the ants' positions are stored as integers between 1 and m.

When computing intervals, for example, R ant's s_i is 6, t=6, m=8:

e_i = (6 +6) mod8 = 12 mod8=4.

So the interval is (6,4) mod8, which wraps around.

So for R ants:

e_i = (s_i + t) % m.

if s_i < e_i: interval is (s_i, e_i).

else: interval is (s_i, m) or (0, e_i).

But the L ants' s's are stored as 1-based numbers.

Similarly for L ants.

So when checking whether an L ant's s is in the interval, we need to handle the 1-based positions.

But perhaps the code should convert all positions to 0-based to avoid confusion.

Wait, no. Because the ants' positions are on a circle of length m, and positions are 1-based. For example, position 1 is next to m and 2.

But when performing modulo operations, it's easier to work with 0-based positions. So perhaps converting s_i to 0-based by subtracting 1.

So for example, s_i = 1 becomes 0, s_i = m becomes m-1.

Then, all operations can be done in 0-based.

So during input processing, subtract 1 from each s_i, and work with 0-based positions. Then, when outputting, add 1 back.

So code steps:

Read s_i and direction. Convert s_i to 0-based: s_i = s_i -1.

Compute virtual position as (s_i + t * direction) mod m, where direction is +1 (R) or -1 (L).

Then, after all processing, convert virtual positions back to 1-based by adding 1.

Yes.

So:

For each ant:

s = s_i -1.

if direction is R:

   virtual = (s + t) % m.

else:

   virtual = (s - t) % m.

then, virtual = (virtual % m) +1.

But wait, (s - t) can be negative. For example, s=0 (original 1), t=1, L: virtual = (0-1) mod m= m-1 → adding 1 gives m → which is the same as 0 in 1-based.

Wait, no. Original 1-based positions are from 1 to m. When converted to 0-based, it's 0 to m-1. Then, after processing, virtual is 0-based, but when outputting, it's converted back to 1-based.

So:

virtual = (s + t) % m if R.

virtual = (s - t) % m if L.

But to compute mod correctly, use:

virtual = (s + t * direction) % m.

Where direction is +1 for R, -1 for L.

Then, virtual = (virtual + m) % m to ensure it's positive.

Then, when outputting, add 1.

Yes.

So the code steps:

Read n, m, t.

Collect ants:

ants = list of tuples (s, direction, original_index).

Separate R and L groups.

sorted_R = sorted([s for ant in ants if ant.direction == 'R']).

sorted_L = sorted([s for ant in ants if ant.direction == 'L']).

For each ant in ants:

   s = ant.s

   direction = ant.direction

   original_index = ant.index

   if direction is 'R':

       e_i = (s + t) % m.

       if s < e_i:

           count = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_L, e_i) - bisect.bisect_right(sorted_L, s)

       else:

           count = (len(sorted_L) - bisect.bisect_right(sorted_L, s)) + bisect.bisect_left(sorted_L, e_i)

       new_index = (original_index + count) % n

   else:

       s_start = (s - t) % m.

       if s_start < s:

           count = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_R, s) - bisect.bisect_right(sorted_R, s_start)

       else:

           count = (len(sorted_R) - bisect.bisect_right(sorted_R, s_start)) + bisect.bisect_left(sorted_R, s)

       new_index = (original_index - count) % n

   virtual = (s + t * (1 if direction == 'R' else -1)) % m

   output_array[new_index] = virtual + 1

Then, print output_array.

Yes.

But need to handle all ants, their directions, compute the count for each, new_index, and then assign virtual+1 to output_array[new_index].

Yes.

Now, implement this in Python.

But in Python, bisect module has bisect_left and bisect_right.

For the R ants:

sorted_L is the list of L ants' s (0-based) sorted.

For s and e_i:

If s < e_i:

   count is the number of elements in sorted_L that are >s and <e_i.

Else:

   count is elements in sorted_L > s, plus elements <e_i.

For the L ants:

sorted_R is the list of R ants' s (0-based) sorted.

s_start is (s -t) mod m.

If s_start < s:

   count is elements in sorted_R that are > s_start and <s.

Else:

   count is elements in sorted_R > s_start, plus elements < s.

Now, code.

But in code:

For R ants:

e_i = (s + t) % m.

if s < e_i:

   count = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_L, e_i) - bisect.bisect_right(sorted_L, s)

else:

   part1 = len(sorted_L) - bisect.bisect_right(sorted_L, s)

   part2 = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_L, e_i)

   count = part1 + part2

For L ants:

s_start = (s - t) % m.

if s_start < s:

   count = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_R, s) - bisect.bisect_right(sorted_R, s_start)

else:

   part1 = len(sorted_R) - bisect.bisect_right(sorted_R, s_start)

   part2 = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_R, s)

   count = part1 + part2

Yes.

Now, handling the original indices:

In the input, ants are read in order, and their original indices are 0-based.

Now, the code:

Wait, let's re-examine sample1.

Sample1's input:

2 ants, m=4, t=8.

Ant0: s=1 (0-based s=0), direction R.

Ant1: s=3 (0-based s=2), direction L.

Processing:

For ant0 (R):

e_i =0 +8=8 mod4=0.

Since s=0 and e_i=0 (s >=e_i), the code computes part1 and part2.

sorted_L is [2].

part1: len(L_s) - bisect_right(L_s, 0) →1-0=1.

part2: bisect_left(L_s, 0) →0.

count=1+0=1.

new_index=0+1=1.

virtual= (0+8) mod4=0 →0+1=1.

output[1] =1.

For ant1 (L):

s_start= (2-8) mod4= (-6) mod4= 2 mod4=2.

s=2.

s_start=2 == s=2. So s_start <s is false.

So count is:

part1= len(R_s) - bisect_right(R_s, 2) →1 - bisect_right([0],2) →1-1=0.

part2= bisect_left(R_s,2) →1.

count=0+1=1.

new_index=1-1=0.

virtual= (2-8) mod4= ( -6 ) mod4= 2 →2+1=3.

output[0]=3.

Thus, output array is [3,1], but the sample expects 1 3.

Ah, this is a problem. So the code is incorrect for sample1.

What's wrong?

Let's look at the sample1:

After t=8.

Ant0's virtual position is (0+8) mod4=0 →1-based 1.

Ant1's virtual position is (2-8) mod4= ( -6 ) mod4= 2 →3.

The code's output is [3,1], but the correct output is1 3.

So why is this happening.

The new indices for the ants are:

Ant0: new_index=1.

Ant1: new_index=0.

So output array is [3,1], but the sample output is 1 3.

So the code is incorrect.

But according to the problem statement, the output should be the ants' positions in the order of their original indices.

Wait, no. The output order is the ants' original indices in the input order, but their positions are arranged according to their new indices.

But according to the code, the new indices are computed and the ants' virtual positions are placed in the output array at new_index. Then, the output array is printed in order of 0 to n-1.

But the sample's expected output is the virtual positions ordered according to the new indices.

In sample1, the output array is [3,1], which would be printed as3 1. But the sample expects1 3.

So what's wrong here.

Ah, the code must have a mistake in how the new indices are computed.

Re-examining the problem statement, the sample1's ants after t=8:

Ant0 (original index0) has virtual position1.

Ant1 (original index1) has virtual position3.

The expected output is1 3.

But according to the code, the output array is [3,1].

So the code's new indices are:

Ant0's new_index=1.

Ant1's new_index=0.

Thus, output array[0] =3, array[1]=1.

So the code outputs3 1, which is wrong.

So the code's logic is incorrect.

What's the reason?

Looking at the code's computation for sample1.

For ant0 (R):

count is1. new_index=0+1=1.

For ant1 (L):

count is1. new_index=1-1=0.

But according to the logic, the new_index for ant0 is1, which places its virtual position at index1 of the output array. ant1's virtual position is at index0.

So the output array is [3,1], but the correct output is1 and3.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

What's wrong with the logic?

Let's re-examine the problem statement.

The collision count for R ants is the number of L ants they've passed. For each collision, their index increases by1.

But in sample1, the R ant (ant0) passes one L ant (ant1). So the new index is0+1=1. But the expected output is1,3.

But in the output array, the ant0's virtual position is1. It's placed at index1. The ant1's virtual position is3, placed at index0. So the output array is [3,1], which is printed as3 1. But the sample expects1 3.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

What's wrong here?

Ah, the error is in the way the new indices are computed. The code's logic assumes that the new index is the original index shifted by the collision count, but this may not be correct.

But according to the sample1, the R ant's new index should be0, and the L ant's new index should be1.

But according to the code's logic, the new indices are1 and0.

So why?

The R ant (ant0) passes one L ant (ant1). So according to the code's logic, new_index=0+1=1.

The L ant (ant1) passes one R ant (ant0). So new_index=1-1=0.

But in reality, after collision, their indices are swapped. So the final indices should be1 and0.

But according to the problem statement's sample output, the ants' virtual positions are1 and3. The output is the virtual positions in the order of the original indices. But according to the code's approach, the output is in the order of new indices.

But the problem's output requires the ants' positions to be listed in the order of the original indices, but their final positions are determined by the new indices.

Wait, no. The output should list the ants in the order of their original indices. So ant0's position should be the virtual position of the ant that ended up in the original ant0's position after all collisions.

But this is not what the code is doing.

Wait, perhaps the code's approach is incorrect.

The code's approach assigns each ant's virtual position to output[new_index], then prints the output array in order of 0 to n-1.

But this would mean that the i-th element of the output array is the virtual position of the ant that ended up at index i after all collisions.

But the problem requires that the output is the virtual positions of the original ants in the input order.

Thus, the code's approach is wrong.

The correct approach is:

The new_index is the index that the ant's virtual position should occupy in the output array. However, the output array is ordered such that the i-th element is the virtual position of the original i-th ant.

But the code's current approach assigns the virtual positions to new_index in the output array, which represents the new indices after collisions. But the problem requires the original indices to be in the input order.

This suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.

The confusion here is between the original indices and the new indices.

The problem requires that the output array is the virtual positions of the original ants, in the order of their original indices.

The code's approach computes new indices for each ant, which are the indices in the output array. But this is incorrect.

The correct approach is to compute, for each original ant, which virtual position (which ant's) corresponds to it. Then, output the virtual positions in the original order.

But how?

The code's current approach is incorrect because it's placing the virtual positions in the output array based on new indices, which correspond to the ants' positions after collisions. But the problem requires that each original ant's virtual position is output in their original order, not based on their new indices.

So the code's approach is wrong.

This is a critical mistake.

The correct approach is:

The ants' virtual positions are computed.

The ants' new indices are determined by the collision counts.

But the output should be the ants' virtual positions in the order of the original indices.

No. The problem requires that the i-th ant in the input has their virtual position adjusted based on collisions. The final output is the ants' positions in the order of their original indices. So for example, if after collisions, the original ant0's position is the virtual position of ant1, then the output for ant0 is ant1's virtual position.

But how to model this.

The code's approach computes for each ant a new index where their virtual position is placed. But this is the wrong way around. The code should compute which ant's virtual position ends up in the original index.

But this is not the same as what the code is doing.

The correct approach is to compute for each original index i, which ant's virtual position should be there.

But how.

Let's think differently.

Each collision swaps the indices of two ants. So after all collisions, the indices of the ants are determined by the number of collisions they've had.

For R ants: the new index is original index + number of L ants passed.

For L ants: new index is original index - number of R ants passed.

These new indices are the positions where the ants' virtual positions should be placed in the output array.

But the output array must be ordered according to the original indices, not the new indices.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

The correct approach is to create a list where each element at index i is the virtual position of the ant that ends up at index i after all collisions. Then, the output array is this list.

But the problem requires that the output is the ants' positions in the order of their original indices. So for each original index i, the output should be the virtual position of the ant that was originally at i, but after the collisions.

But the code's approach is to compute for each ant their new index and place their virtual position there. Then, the output array is the list of virtual positions in the order of new indices.

But this would mean that the output array's i-th element is the virtual position of the ant that ends up at index i, which is not what the problem requires.

The problem requires that the i-th element of the output is the virtual position of the ant that was originally at index i.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem.

The correct approach is to compute for each original ant, what is their virtual position, and then determine the order in which these virtual positions should be output to reflect the collisions.

But how to compute this order.

The correct approach is:

The ants' virtual positions are sorted in a certain way. The order is determined by the collision counts.

For example, the R ants' order in the sorted virtual positions is their original order plus the collision count.

The L ants' order is their original order minus collision count.

But how to sort the virtual positions based on this.

Alternatively, after computing the new indices, the ants' virtual positions are placed in the output array such that the output array's new_index is the virtual position. Then, the output array is printed in order. But this is the code's approach and it's incorrect.

But sample1's output is3 1 according to the code, but the correct output is1 3.

Thus, the code's approach is wrong.

So what's the correct approach?

The problem requires that after collisions, the ants are arranged in their virtual positions, but the order of the ants' indices in the output is the same as their original indices. But how?

No, the problem requires that the output is the final positions of the ants, in the order of their original indices. So each ant's final position is their virtual position, but the ants' indices are determined by how many collisions they've had.

Thus, the correct way is to compute for each original index i, the final position is the virtual position of the ant that ends up in position i after all collisions.

But how to compute which ant ends up in position i.

The code's approach is to compute for each ant their new index (where they end up), and place their virtual position there. Then, output the array in order. But this is correct if the new indices are the positions where the ants end up.

But according to sample1's code's output, this approach leads to wrong results.

But sample1's expected output is1 3.

In the code's approach, the ants are placed at new indices 1 and0, resulting in output3 1.

But the correct output is1 3.

This suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.

What's the correct way?

Alternative approach:

Each ant's new index is where they would end up in the output array. For example, after collisions, the ants' new indices are such that the ants are ordered by their virtual positions. So the output array is sorted by virtual positions, and the ants' new indices are determined by their collision counts.

But this is not the case.

Alternatively, the ants' new indices are such that the output array, when sorted by new indices, gives the order of the ants' virtual positions.

But I'm not sure.

This is a very confusing problem.

Let me think again.

The problem statement requires that the output is the positions of the ants after t time units, in the order of their original indices.

So for each original index i (0-based), we need to determine which ant's virtual position is at i after all collisions.

The code's approach assigns each ant's virtual position to new_index in the output array. So output_array[new_index] = virtual.

Then, the output array is printed in order. So the i-th element of the output array is the virtual position of the ant whose new_index is i.

But the problem requires that the i-th element is the virtual position of the original i-th ant.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

The correct approach is to compute, for each original ant i, what is their virtual position after collisions, and then place that in the output array at position i.

But how to compute this.

The new indices computed by the code are the positions where the ants end up. So the original i-th ant's virtual position is located at new_index in the output array. So to get the output array in the order of the original indices, we need to invert this mapping.

For example, if the original ant0's new_index is1, then output_array[1] is the virtual position of ant0. So to get the output in the order of original indices, we need to collect the virtual positions from the new indices.

But this requires creating a reverse mapping.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect. Instead, we need to create a list where for each original index i, the virtual position is output_array[new_index], where new_index is the new index computed for the original ant i.

But this would require creating a list of virtual positions sorted according to their new indices, then assigning them to the original indices.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the code's approach is correct, but the sample1's expected output is incorrect. But that's unlikely.

But sample1's code's output is3 1, but the expected is1 3.

This indicates that the code's logic is wrong.

So where is the mistake?

In the code, new_index is computed as follows:

For R ants:

new_index = (original_index + count) % n.

For L ants:

new_index = (original_index - count) % n.

But in sample1, for ant0 (R):

count=1.

new_index=0+1=1.

For ant1 (L):

count=1.

new_index=1-1=0.

So the output array is:

output[1] =1.

output[0] =3.

Thus, the output array is [3,1], which is printed as3 1.

But the sample expects1 3.

So according to the code's logic, the ants' virtual positions are placed in the output array at their new indices. But the problem requires that the output is the ants' virtual positions in the order of their original indices. So the code's approach is incorrect.

The correct approach should be that each original ant's virtual position is computed, but their new index is the position they end up in after collisions. The output is the virtual positions in the order of the new indices.

But according to the problem statement, the output should be in the order of the original indices, which is not the case.

This suggests that the code's logic is fundamentally wrong.

At this point, I'm stuck and need to find a different approach.

After further research, I found that the correct approach is to realize that when ants pass through each other, their labels are swapped. Thus, after all collisions, the ants' labels are determined by the number of opposite ants they have passed.

For R ants, the number of L ants passed is added to their original index.

For L ants, the number of R ants passed is subtracted from their original index.

But this new index must be taken modulo n.

The output array should be sorted according to the new indices, and the virtual positions are assigned to these new indices.

But the problem requires that the output is the virtual positions in the original order of the ants.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect. The correct approach is to compute for each original ant, their new index, then sort the ants by new indices and output their virtual positions in that order.

But the problem requires that the output is in the original order of the ants.

Thus, the correct approach is to compute for each original ant, their new index, and then create a list where the i-th element is the virtual position of the ant that has new_index = i.

Then, output this list.

But the code's current approach is to place the virtual positions in the new_index positions, then output the list. This is correct if the new indices are the positions in the output array.

But sample1's code output is [3,1], but the correct output is1 and3.

But according to the code's approach, the new indices are1 and0. So the output array is [3,1], which is printed as3 1.

This is incorrect.

Thus, the code's approach is wrong.

The correct approach is to compute for each new index, which original ant is placed there. Then, the output array is the virtual positions of these original ants in new index order.

But how to compute this.

Let's think again.

The code's new_index for ant0 is1.

For ant1, new_index is0.

Thus, the ants' new indices are1 and0.

So the output array should be sorted by new index:

new_index0: ant1's virtual position3.

new_index1: ant0's virtual position1.

Thus, the output is3 1.

But the problem's sample expects1 3.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

But according to the problem's sample1, after time t=8, the ants are back to their original positions. So their virtual positions are1 and3. But the code's code's virtual positions are computed correctly as1 and3.

But the output array is ordered according to new indices, which are1 and0. So the code's output is3 1.

But the correct output is1 3.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

The problem is that the code's approach is placing the ants' virtual positions according to their new indices, but the output must be the ants' virtual positions in their original indices.

Thus, the correct approach is to find for each original index i, which ant's virtual position should be placed there.

This requires reversing the new indices mapping.

Thus, for each original index i, the virtual position to output is the one from the ant whose new_index is i.

For example, in sample1:

ant0's new_index is1. So the ant with new_index0 is ant1.

Thus, output array's index0 is ant1's virtual position3.

Output array's index1 is ant0's virtual position1.

Thus, output is3 1.

But the sample expects1 3.

This suggests that the code's approach is correct, but the problem's sample is wrong. But this is not possible.

Thus, there's a fundamental flaw in the logic.

After further research, I found that the correct approach is to realize that the new indices are the positions where the ants' virtual positions should be placed in the output array, and the output array is printed in order. So the code's approach is correct, but the sample's expected output is different.

But sample1's expected output is1 3, but the code's output is3 1. This suggests that the code is incorrect.

But according to the problem statement, the sample's explanation is:

In sample1, after 8 time units, the ants return to their original positions and directions. So their positions are1 and3, and the output is1 3.

But according to the code's approach, the ants' virtual positions are1 and3, but they are placed in the output array at indices1 and0, giving output3 1.

This indicates that the code's approach is incorrect.

Thus, the error must be in the computation of the new indices.

Let's re-examine the new index computation for sample1.

For ant0 (R):

count=1.

new_index=0+1=1.

For ant1 (L):

count=1.

new_index=1-1=0.

So the output array is [3,1].

But the correct output is1 3.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

What's the error in the new index computation?

The R ant's new index is original index + count.

But according to the problem's example, the R ant should end up in the original position0, but according to the code's logic, it's new index is1.

Thus, the code's logic for new index computation is incorrect.

But why?

In sample1, the ants collide once. So the R ant's new index should be0 +1 =1. But the ants' positions are back to their original positions, so the original indices should be correct.

But the code's approach gives new indices 1 and0.

Thus, the code's logic for new indices is incorrect.

The error is in how the new indices are computed.

The correct new indices for sample1 should be0 and1.

But according to the code's logic, they are1 and0.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

But why?

Let's re-examine the collision count for sample1.

For ant0 (R):

The interval is (0,0) mod4 → which is the entire circle.

The L ants in this interval are ant1's s=2 (0-based 2).

Thus, count=1.

But according to the code's logic, new index is0+1=1.

But why is this incorrect.

The collision count for R ants is the number of L ants passed. Each collision swaps the ant's index with the L ant's index. So if an R ant passes one L ant, their indices are swapped once.

But how does this affect their new indices.

In sample1, the R ant passes one L ant.

Thus, their indices are swapped. So the R ant's new index is1, and the L ant's new index is0.

But according to the problem statement, the output should be the original ants' positions in their original order, which is1 and3. But according to the code's approach, the output is3 and1.

This suggests that the code's logic is wrong.

But why?

The problem requires that the output is the positions of the ants in the order of their original indices. So the i-th element of the output is the position of the ant that was initially at index i.

But after collisions, the ants' indices are swapped.

So in sample1, the original R ant (index0) is now at index1, and the original L ant (index1) is now at index0. Thus, the output array's index0 is the L ant's virtual position3, and index1 is the R ant's virtual position1. So output is3 1.

But the sample expects1 3.

This indicates that the problem statement's sample is incorrect or that the code's logic is wrong.

But according to the problem statement's sample, the output is1 3, which corresponds to the R ant's virtual position1 and the L ant's virtual position3. But according to the code's logic, the ants' indices are swapped.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

The problem is that the code's logic for new index computation is incorrect.

But what's the correct way to compute the new indices?

Alternative approach:

The collision count for R ants is the number of L ants passed. The new index for R ants is original index + count.

The new index for L ants is original index - count.

But in sample1, the R ant has count=1. new_index=0+1=1.

The L ant has count=1. new_index=1-1=0.

Thus, the output array is [3,1], which is incorrect.

But according to the problem statement, the output should be1 3.

Thus, the code's logic is wrong.

But why? Because the problem's sample shows that the ants' virtual positions are correct, but the order of the output is the same as the original indices.

Thus, the code's approach is wrong.

The correct approach must be that the new indices are computed such that the ants' virtual positions are sorted in a certain way, and the output array is this sorted list.

But how.

Alternatively, the code's approach is correct, but the problem's sample is incorrect. But this is unlikely.

Thus, I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem.

After re-reading the problem statement:

The output is the positions of the ants in the order of their original indices. So for each ant in the input order, their final position is computed.

But according to the problem's sample1, after t=8, the ants return to their initial positions. So their virtual positions are1 and3. The output is1 3.

But according to the code's logic, the ants' new indices are1 and0, so the output array is3 1.

This suggests that the code's approach is incorrect.

Thus, the code's logic for new indices is wrong.

But why?

The collision count for R ants is the number of L ants they've passed. But in sample1, the R ant passes the L ant once, which should swap their indices.

Thus, the R ant's new index should be1, and the L ant's new index is0. But the problem's sample expects the ants to have their original indices. So the code's approach must be incorrect.

But why.

The key realization is that the collision count is the number of times the ant has passed other ants. Each time an R ant passes a L ant, their indices are swapped. So for each such swap, the R ant's index increases by1, and the L ant's index decreases by1.

Thus, for the R ant, new index is original index + count.

For the L ant, new index is original index - count.

But in sample1:

R ant's count is1. new index=0+1=1.

L ant's count is1. new index=1-1=0.

Thus, the R ant's index is1, L ant's index is0.

So the output array is [3,1], which is not what the sample expects.

But according to the problem statement's sample, the output is1 3.

Thus, the code's approach is wrong.

But why.

The problem's sample's expected output indicates that the ants' indices have not swapped. But according to the collision count, they should have.

Thus, there's a mistake in the collision count computation.

Re-examining the collision count for sample1.

R ant's interval is (0,0) mod4. Since the entire circle is considered, the L ant's s=2 is in this interval.

Thus, count=1.

But the R ant's interval is (0,0) mod4, which is the entire circle. So L ant's s=2 is within the interval.

Thus, count is1.

But according to the sample, the ants did not swap.

This suggests that the code's logic for collision count is wrong.

But why.

In sample1, the R ant's virtual position is0 (0-based), which is the same as their initial position. The L ant's virtual position is2 (0-based), which is the same as their initial position.

Thus, they didn't pass each other. But according to the code's logic, the collision count is1.

Thus, the code's logic for collision count is incorrect.

But why.

The ants' virtual positions are0 and2, which are the same as their initial positions. Thus, after t=8 units, the ants have completed full circles and returned to their initial positions.

Thus, they did not collide.

But the code's logic counts a collision.

This indicates that the code's collision count logic is wrong.

Ah! Here's the error.

In the code's logic, the collision count is computed based on the initial positions and the movement. But the ants may not have collided, but the code's logic counts them as having collided.

In sample1, the ants are moving in opposite directions. The R ant moves counter-clockwise (R) and the L ant moves clockwise (L). At t=8, they complete two full circles (each circle is4 units) and return to their initial positions. Thus, they did not collide during their movement, because they are moving in a circle and the time t is a multiple of the period.

Thus, the code's collision count is incorrect.

But why.

The code's logic for collision count is based on the initial positions and the interval (s_i, s_i +t mod m) for R ants. But this interval may include ants that are not passed due to the circular nature.

Thus, the code's logic for collision count is incorrect.

In sample1, the ants' virtual positions are the same as their initial positions. Thus, they did not pass each other. But according to the code's logic, the R ant's interval (0,0 mod4) includes the entire circle, and thus the L ant's s=2 is counted as a collision. But in reality, they did not pass each other.

Thus, the code's logic for collision count is incorrect.

The error is in the code's interval computation.

For the R ant's interval (s_i, e_i), where e_i = (s_i +t) mod m.

But when s_i == e_i, the code assumes that the entire circle is covered. But when t is a multiple of m, the R ant's interval covers the entire circle. But in reality, the R ant has made t/m full circles and returns to the initial position, but did not pass any ants.

Thus, the code's logic counts ants that are in the entire circle when e_i == s_i.

But when e_i == s_i, the R ant has not moved at all (if t mod m ==0), or has made full circles.

Thus, the interval (s_i, e_i) when e_i ==s_i is the entire circle. But in this case, the R ant has made full circles and thus passed all L ants once for each full circle.

But in sample1, t=8, m=4. Thus, the R ant makes 8/4=2 full circles.

Thus, the code's logic counts one L ant passed per full circle. So for two full circles, the count should be2*1=2.

But according to the code's logic, the count is1.

Thus, the code's collision count is incorrect.

Thus, the code's logic for collision count is incorrect.

The code's logic assumes that the ants passed each other once when the interval wraps around. But in reality, the number of times they passed each other is t/m.

Thus, the code's approach for collision count is incorrect when the ants make multiple full circles.

Thus, the code's logic for collision count is wrong.

Thus, the correct approach must account for the number of full circles made by the ants.

But how
