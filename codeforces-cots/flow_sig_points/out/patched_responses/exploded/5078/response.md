Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about counting the number of pairs (A, x) where A is a subset of servers infected by a virus with x, such that after flipping the keys using x (via XOR), all edges remain safe. All edges must have their two endpoints with different keys. The initial setup ensures all edges are safe, but after some subsets A and x, we need to check that for every edge (u, v), the keys of u and v are different.

First, let's understand the constraints. For each edge (u, v), after infection, their keys must be different. Let's denote that c_u XOR (x if u is in A) XOR (x if v is in A) should not equal c_v. Wait, no. Wait, when a server is in A, its key is c_i XOR x. So for edge (u, v), after infection, the keys are (c_u XOR x * a_u) and (c_v XOR x * a_v), where a_u and a_v are 1 if the server is in A, 0 otherwise. The condition is that these two values are not equal.

So for each edge (u, v), we need (c_u XOR (a_u * x)) != (c_v XOR (a_v * x)). Let's rearrange this. Let's say that (c_u XOR c_v) XOR ( (a_u XOR a_v) * x ) ) != 0. Because (a XOR b) = (a XOR x) XOR (b XOR x) when x is same for both. Wait, no. Let's compute:

c_u XOR (a_u x) != c_v XOR (a_v x)
=> (c_u XOR c_v) XOR (a_u x XOR a_v x) ) != 0
=> (c_u XOR c_v) XOR ( (a_u XOR a_v) x ) ) != 0.

Because XOR is associative and commutative. So for each edge (u, v), (c_u XOR c_v) XOR ( (a_u XOR a_v) * x ) must not be 0. Let's denote d_uv = c_u XOR c_v. Then the condition is d_uv XOR ( (a_u XOR a_v) x ) != 0.

But wait, in the initial state, d_uv is not zero, because all edges are safe. So d_uv is already non-zero. So after infection, the new d_uv' is d_uv XOR ( (a_u XOR a_v) x ), and this must also not be zero.

So for each edge, we have that ( (a_u XOR a_v) x ) must not be equal to d_uv. Because d_uv XOR (something) is not zero if and only if that something is not equal to d_uv. Because XORing with d_uv gives non-zero only if the two are different.

Wait, let me think. Suppose we have a value A. Then A XOR B is zero if B = A. So to have A XOR B != 0, B must not equal A. So in our case, for each edge, the condition is that ( (a_u XOR a_v) x ) != d_uv.

So for each edge, this must hold. Now, x is a variable here, and the a's are variables (since A is a subset). Our goal is to count all possible pairs (A, x) that satisfy all these edge conditions.

This seems tricky. Let's think about how x and the a's interact. For each edge, the condition is (a_u XOR a_v) * x != d_uv. Let's consider possible cases for (a_u XOR a_v).

Case 1: a_u XOR a_v = 0. Then the left side is 0 * x = 0. So the condition becomes 0 != d_uv. But d_uv is already non-zero (as per problem statement), so this condition is automatically satisfied. So in this case, the edge is safe regardless of x. So for edges where a_u and a_v are in the same state (both in A or both not in A), the edge's safety is guaranteed.

Case 2: a_u XOR a_v = 1. Then the left side is x. So the condition becomes x != d_uv. So for such edges (those where a_u and a_v are in different subsets), x must not be equal to d_uv.

Therefore, the problem reduces to the following:

We need to count all possible subsets A of servers and x values, such that for all edges:

- If a_u XOR a_v is 0 (same subset), no condition on x (since the edge is safe).
- If a_u XOR a_v is 1 (different subsets), then x must not be equal to d_uv.

So the constraints on x are that for all edges where a_u and a_v are in different subsets, x must not be in the set {d_uv for those edges}.

So the approach is to model the possible subsets A, determine for each such subset the forbidden x values (those x that equal any d_uv where a_u and a_v differ in A), and then calculate the number of x's allowed (total x's minus forbidden ones) and sum over all possible A.

But given the constraints on n and m (up to 5e5), enumerating all subsets A is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.

Let's think in terms of variables:

Each subset A is a bitmask (each server is 0 or 1 indicating inclusion). For each edge (u, v), the a_u and a_v determine whether the edge contributes a forbidden value to x. So the forbidden x values for a subset A is the union of all d_uv where a_u and a_v are different.

The number of x's allowed is (2^k) minus the number of forbidden x values, provided that all forbidden x values are distinct. Wait, but if multiple edges in A's configuration lead to the same d_uv, then x must avoid all of them. So the forbidden x set is the union of all d_uv for edges where a_u XOR a_v is 1. So the size of this set is the number of unique d_uv in those edges. Then, allowed x's are 2^k minus the size of forbidden set.

But how do we model this? We need to find for each possible subset A (which is a 0/1 assignment to the nodes), the forbidden x set is the set of d_uv for edges where a_u and a_v are in different subsets. Then, the number of x's allowed is 2^k - |S|, where S is this forbidden set.

The total answer is the sum over all subsets A of (2^k - |S_A|), where S_A is the forbidden set for A.

But again, considering the size of n and m, enumerating all A is impossible. So we need a way to compute this sum efficiently.

Alternative approach: Instead of considering each subset A, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of constraints that the subsets A must satisfy, and then calculate the contributions based on how the edges are handled.

Let's think about the constraints on x. For each subset A, the forbidden x values are the set {d_uv | (u, v) in E, a_u XOR a_v = 1}. Let S_A be this set. The count for this A is (2^k - |S_A|). The total answer is sum_{A} (2^k - |S_A|).

We can split this sum into two parts: sum (2^k) for all A, minus sum (|S_A|) for all A.

The first part is (2^k) multiplied by 2^n (since there are 2^n subsets A). The second part is the sum over all A of |S_A|.

So the answer is 2^{n} * 2^k - sum_A |S_A|.

But then, sum_A |S_A| is equal to the sum over all edges e of the number of subsets A where e is in S_A (i.e., for edge e, a_u XOR a_v = 1, and thus d_e is part of S_A). Because each S_A is a collection of d_uv for edges where a_u and a_v differ. So the size |S_A| is the number of edges in the cut (A, not A). But then, when edges are in the same d_uv, they contribute multiple times. Wait, no. Because |S_A| counts the number of unique d_uv in the cut edges. Wait, no. S_A is a set. So for example, if two edges e and f have the same d_uv, and both are in the cut (a_u XOR a_v = 1 for both), then S_A will include d_uv once, not twice. So |S_A| is the number of distinct d_uv among all edges in the cut.

So the sum over A of |S_A| is the sum over all possible subsets A of the number of distinct d_uv's in the cut edges of A.

But how do we compute this sum?

Hmm. Let's think of it as for each possible subset A, for each edge e in the cut, if the d_uv of e is unique among all cut edges, then it contributes 1 to |S_A|. But how to model this?

Alternatively, for each possible d value (from all possible d_uv of edges), we can compute the number of subsets A where d is in S_A. Then the sum over all d of the number of subsets A where d is in S_A will give us the sum of |S_A|. Because each d in S_A contributes 1 to the sum, and the total is the sum over all d of how many times d appears in any S_A. But since S_A is a set, each d can appear at most once per subset A. So for each d, the number of subsets A where d is present in S_A is equal to the number of subsets A where there's at least one edge e with d_uv = d that is in the cut (A's partition) of e. But wait, no. For a subset A, d is in S_A if there exists at least one edge e in the cut of A with d_uv = d. So for a given d, the number of subsets A where d is in S_A is equal to the number of subsets A where at least one edge e with d_uv = d is in the cut of A.

So sum over all A of |S_A| = sum over all d (number of subsets A where d is in S_A).

Thus, the problem reduces to:

Compute 2^{n + k} - sum_{d} (number of subsets A where at least one edge with d_uv =d is in the cut of A) mod 1e9+7.

Wait, but how do we compute this sum for all possible d? Because d can be up to 2^60-1, but m is up to 5e5, so the possible number of distinct d's is up to 5e5. Because each edge has a d_uv, but there could be duplicates.

So for each distinct d, we can compute the number of subsets A where at least one edge with d_uv =d is in the cut. Then sum all those and subtract from 2^{n + k} to get the answer.

Wait, but the initial formula is:

answer = 2^{n +k} - sum_{d} (f(d)), where f(d) is the number of subsets A where d is in S_A (i.e., there exists at least one edge e with d_uv =d that is in the cut of A).

But how do we compute f(d) for each distinct d?

Let's denote that for a particular d, let E_d be the set of edges e where d_uv =d. Then, f(d) is the number of subsets A where at least one edge from E_d is in the cut of A.

This is equivalent to the inclusion-exclusion principle. Let's think of it as the total number of subsets A where for some e in E_d, e is in the cut. But edges can be overlapping, so inclusion-exclusion is complicated. But perhaps we can model this using the inclusion-exclusion formula.

Alternatively, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of subsets A where at least one edge in E_d is cut is equal to the total number of subsets A minus the number of subsets where none of the edges in E_d are cut.

So f(d) = total_subsets - subsets_where_no_e_in_E_d_are_cut.

Total subsets is 2^n.

Subsets where none of the edges in E_d are cut: this is the number of subsets A where for all e in E_d, the endpoints u and v are in the same subset (i.e., a_u = a_v). 

So the problem reduces to, for each d, compute the number of subsets A where all edges in E_d are not cut (i.e., u and v are in the same subset as each other for each e in E_d).

This is equivalent to finding the number of connected components in the graph formed by the edges E_d. Because for the subsets to satisfy that u and v are in the same subset as each other for all edges in E_d, the subsets must assign the same value (0 or 1) to all nodes in the same connected component. Then, the number of such subsets is 2^c, where c is the number of connected components in the graph formed by E_d.

Wait, exactly. Because each connected component can be assigned to 0 or 1 independently, but all nodes in a connected component must have the same assignment. So the total number of subsets that satisfy all edges in E_d being not cut is 2^c, where c is the number of connected components in the graph formed by E_d.

Therefore, for each d, the number of subsets A that avoid cutting any edges in E_d is 2^c, where c is the number of connected components of the graph (V, E_d).

Thus, f(d) = 2^n - 2^c.

So the sum over all d of f(d) is sum_d (2^n - 2^{c_d}), where c_d is the number of connected components in the graph for edges E_d.

So putting it all together:

answer = (2^{n} * 2^k) - sum_{d} (2^n - 2^{c_d}) mod MOD.

So the steps we need to perform are:

1. For all edges, compute their d_uv (c_u XOR c_v). Group edges by their d_uv. For each distinct d, collect all edges with that d.

2. For each distinct d, compute the number of connected components c_d in the graph formed by those edges.

3. For each such d, compute (2^n - 2^c_d) and sum these over all d. Subtract this sum from 2^{n +k} to get the answer.

But how do we handle the edges? Since the edges are grouped by their d_uv, and for each group, we need to compute the connected components.

But m can be up to 5e5, and each edge is in exactly one group (since the grouping is by d_uv). So for each group d, we process its edges and compute the connected components.

But for each group, how do we compute the connected components efficiently?

We can model each group's edges as a graph, and use a union-find (disjoint set) data structure to find the number of connected components. For each group d, the edges are processed, and the union-find structure is built for the nodes involved in those edges, then the number of connected components is (initial components, which is the number of unique nodes involved, but then with union operations) but wait, the actual connected components are the ones that include all nodes connected via the edges in the group. However, the union-find structure must track the nodes present in the group's edges. So for each group d:

- Initialize a DSU (disjoint set union) structure for the nodes involved in edges of d.

- For each edge (u, v) in E_d, perform union(u, v).

- The number of connected components is equal to (number of nodes in the group) - (number of unions made) + (initial number of separate nodes). Wait, no. The DSU structure's count of connected components is tracked as we perform unions. Alternatively, after processing all edges, the DSU's count will be the number of connected components in the graph formed by the edges in E_d and the nodes present in those edges.

But for nodes not in any edges of E_d, they are not part of this graph. So for the graph formed by E_d, the connected components are the components formed by the edges in E_d. So, for example, if a group d has edges (1,2) and (2,3), then the connected components for those nodes are merged. Nodes not present in any edges of E_d are considered as individual components (but in the DSU, they are not even tracked if they are not part of any edge in E_d).

Wait, no. Because when you process the edges for a group d, the DSU will track all nodes that are part of those edges. For example, if group d has edges (u, v), then u and v are added to the DSU. For nodes not present in any edges of the group, they are not part of the DSU for that group.

So, the number of connected components for the group d is equal to the number of nodes in the DSU (for that group) minus the number of unions plus the initial count (each node starts as its own component). But the DSU structure for group d starts with no nodes. For each edge (u, v) in group d, u and v are added to the DSU (if not already present), and then unioned. The number of connected components is tracked as the DSU's count.

Alternatively, for each group d:

- Collect all the nodes involved in the edges of the group.

- The initial number of connected components is the size of the set of these nodes.

- For each edge in the group, perform union(u, v).

- The final number of connected components is the initial number minus the number of successful unions (unions that merged two different components).

But handling this for each group can be done via a DSU structure.

So the steps for each group d:

1. Collect all unique nodes in E_d.

   For example, for each edge (u, v) in E_d, add u and v to a set.

   Let the number of unique nodes be s.

2. Initialize DSU with these nodes. Each node starts as its own parent.

3. The initial number of connected components is s.

4. For each edge (u, v) in E_d:

   Perform union(u, v). Each successful union (i.e., when u and v were in different components) reduces the connected components count by 1.

5. The final connected components count is s - (number of successful unions).

   So after processing all edges, the count is c_d.

But wait, for the DSU, the count starts at s. For each edge, if merging two different components, count decreases by 1.

So, the final connected components for the group d is c_d = (initial count) - number of successful unions.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Each group's DSU can be processed independently. For each group, the number of nodes s is the number of unique nodes in the edges of that group.

So for example, if a group has 3 edges (u1, v1), (u2, v2), (u3, v3), and all these nodes are unique, then s is 6. Then, each union may merge some of them.

But this could be time-consuming if there are many groups. However, the total number of edges across all groups is m, which is up to 5e5. So for each group, processing the edges in O(α(s)) time per edge, where α is the inverse Ackermann function, which is manageable.

But the problem is that for each group, we need to process all edges, and each group may have O(m) edges. However, m is up to 5e5, so the total time for all groups is O(m α(n)), which is acceptable.

So, the plan is:

- For each edge (u, v), compute d = c_u XOR c_v. Group edges by d.

- For each group d in the groups:

   - Collect all edges in this group.

   - Collect all unique nodes involved in these edges.

   - Initialize a DSU for these nodes.

   - Process each edge (u, v) in the group, performing unions.

   - Compute c_d as the final number of connected components in this group's DSU.

   - Compute the term (2^n - 2^{c_d}) and add it to the sum.

Finally, compute the answer as (2^{n + k} - sum_terms) mod MOD.

But wait, the formula was sum_terms = sum_d (2^n - 2^{c_d}), so answer = 2^{n} * 2^k - sum_terms = 2^{n +k} - sum_terms.

Yes.

Now, let's compute 2^{n} * 2^k = 2^{n +k}.

But what if k is 60 and n is 5e5? Then 2^{n +k} is way beyond anything we can compute directly. However, since we need to compute this modulo 1e9+7, we can use modular exponentiation.

But wait, 2^{n} is 2^5e5, which is manageable modulo MOD (since 5e5 is manageable with binary exponentiation).

Similarly, for each group, 2^{c_d} must be computed modulo MOD.

But c_d can be up to the number of unique nodes in the group. For a group with s nodes, the maximum possible c_d is s (if all edges are loops, but the problem states that u and v are distinct, but edges can form cycles and not merge any components). So, 2^c_d is manageable.

So, the steps for the code:

1. Read n, m, k.

2. Read c array (list of c_i for each server).

3. For each of the m edges:

   a. Read u and v (assuming 1-based indices, so subtract 1 to make 0-based if needed).

   b. Compute d = c[u] XOR c[v].

   c. Add this edge to a dictionary mapping d to a list of edges.

4. For each d in the dictionary:

   a. Collect all edges in this group.

   b. Collect all unique nodes involved in these edges. Let s be the count.

   c. Initialize DSU for these nodes.

   d. For each edge (u, v) in the group, perform union(u, v).

   e. Compute c_d as the number of connected components in the DSU.

   f. Compute term = (pow(2, n, MOD) - pow(2, c_d, MOD)) % MOD.

   g. Add term to the sum_terms.

5. The answer is (pow(2, n +k, MOD) - sum_terms) % MOD.

But wait, for groups with the same d, are we handling them correctly? Because each group is processed once per distinct d. For example, if two edges have the same d, they are in the same group and their edges are processed together. So yes.

But what about d=0? Because in the problem statement, the initial edges are safe, so their d_uv can't be 0. But wait, the problem statement says that the initial assignment is safe. So for any edge (u, v), c_u XOR c_v !=0. So all edges have d_uv !=0. So in the code, d will never be zero. So the groups are for d !=0.

But the code doesn't need to check for this; it's guaranteed by the problem.

But during code submission, perhaps in the test cases, the input could have m=0. Then, the code will have to handle that.

But the code doesn't need to handle d=0 edges, since the problem says the initial edges are safe, so all edges in the input have d_uv !=0.

So the code is safe.

Now, let's test this approach with the first example.

First example input:

4 4 2

c = [0, 1, 0, 1]

Edges:

1-2 (d=0^1=1)

2-3 (1^0=1)

3-4 (0^1=1)

4-1 (1^0=1)

So all edges have d=1. So the group for d=1 has 4 edges.

Processing this group:

All edges are in the same group. The nodes involved are 0,1,2,3 (assuming 0-based). Wait, wait the input uses 1-based nodes. So the edges are (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,1). So nodes are 1,2,3,4. So the unique nodes are 4.

The DSU starts with 4 nodes. Then, each edge connects them. For example:

1 and 2 are connected. Then 2 and 3 are connected. Then 3 and 4. Then 4 and 1. All four nodes are connected into a single component. So c_d is 1.

So term is 2^4 (since n=4) - 2^1 = 16-2=14.

Sum_terms is 14.

The answer is 2^{4+2} -14 = 64*16= 2^6=64? Wait, n=4, k=2: 4+2=6. 2^6=64. 64 -14=50, which matches the sample output.

Yes.

Another example: the second sample input.

But let's proceed to code.

Now, the code steps:

Implement the DSU for each group. Since for each group, the nodes can be up to n (but each group's edges are processed independently), but per group, the DSU is built for the nodes involved in that group's edges.

But how to represent the DSU? For each group, we can use a dictionary to track the parent of each node. However, for performance, since the nodes are up to 5e5, but for each group, the number of nodes is small (but up to m, but m is 5e5), using a hash map for each group may be too slow.

Alternative approach: For each group, collect all the nodes, assign them temporary indices, and use a list-based DSU. But for code simplicity, perhaps using a dictionary-based DSU per group is manageable.

But for large m, this could be slow.

Alternative idea: precompute all the edges grouped by d, then for each group, process the nodes as follows:

Collect all nodes in the group's edges. Then, map each unique node to an index (like 0, 1, 2, ...), and use a list-based DSU.

But in Python, for each group, this could be handled by creating a list (parents) where the indices are the mapped indices of the nodes.

So for a group's nodes, we can create a list of unique nodes, then for each node, assign an index (e.g., via a dictionary), then build the DSU based on these indices.

This approach would be efficient.

So the steps for processing a group:

edges = list of edges (u, v) in this group.

nodes = set of all u and v in the edges.

unique_nodes = sorted(nodes) (or any order)

size = len(unique_nodes)

parent = list(range(size))

rank = [1]*size

Then, for each (u, v) in edges:

   u_idx = index of u in unique_nodes (like via a dictionary)

   v_idx = index of v in unique_nodes

   find the roots of u_idx and v_idx. If different, union them.

After processing all edges, the number of connected components is the number of roots in the parent array.

But in practice, it's easier to track the number of connected components as we perform unions.

So initial count is size.

Each time we perform a union that merges two different components, decrement count by 1.

So the code for each group:

unique_nodes = list of unique nodes in edges.

node_to_idx = {u: idx for idx, u in enumerate(unique_nodes)}

size = len(unique_nodes)

parent = list(range(size))

rank = [1]*size

count = size  # current number of connected components

for u, v in edges:

   u_idx = node_to_idx[u]

   v_idx = node_to_idx[v]

   root_u = find(u_idx)

   root_v = find(v_idx)

   if root_u != root_v:

       if rank[root_u] > rank[root_v]:

           parent[root_v] = root_u

       else:

           parent[root_u] = root_v

           if rank[root_u] == rank[root_v]:

               rank[root_v] +=1

       count -=1

c_d = count

term = (pow(2, n, MOD) - pow(2, c_d, MOD)) % MOD

sum_terms += term

But this is manageable.

So the code would group the edges by their d_uv, process each group by building a DSU for the nodes in the group's edges, compute the count of connected components, then calculate the term.

Now, considering that m can be up to 5e5, and each group's edges are processed once, the total time is O(m α(n)), which is acceptable.

In Python, using dictionaries for node_to_idx and processing each group's edges in O(m) total time.

Now, handling the edge cases.

For example, if there are no edges (m=0), then the answer is 2^{n +k} - 0 = 2^{n +k} mod MOD.

Another case: when a group has no edges (but according to the problem statement, all edges are safe, but m can be zero).

But in code, if m=0, the group loop (for each d in edges) is not entered, sum_terms remains 0, so answer is 2^{n +k}.

Another case: group d has multiple edges, but they form a tree. Then c_d is s - (s-1) =1.

So 2^{c_d} is 2^1. So term is 2^n - 2^1.

Now, code implementation.

But in Python, for handling large exponents, we can precompute pow(2, n, MOD) once, then compute pow(2, c_d, MOD) per group.

So code steps:

Read n, m, k.

Read c as a list (0-based or 1-based? The input is 1-based nodes, but when we read c_i, the i-th is for the i-th server (1-based). So in code, perhaps read them as 1-based and convert to 0-based for processing? Or keep as 1-based. Probably better to process as 1-based.

Wait, the edges are given as u_i and v_i (1-based in the input). So when processing edges, u and v are 1-based. So in code, when building the DSU for a group, the nodes are 1-based.

But for the code, it's not a problem as long as we treat them as unique identifiers.

But in Python, using integers (like 1,2,3,4) as node identifiers is manageable.

So code:

MOD = 10**9 +7

n, m, k = map(int, input().split())

c = list(map(int, input().split()))

from collections import defaultdict

groups = defaultdict(list)

for _ in range(m):

    u, v = map(int, input().split())

    u -=1  # converting to 0-based for c array.

    v -=1

    d = c[u] ^ c[v]

    groups[d].append( (u+1, v+1) )  # store edges as 1-based.

sum_terms = 0

pow_2n = pow(2, n, MOD)

for d, edges in groups.items():

    # collect all unique nodes in edges

    nodes = set()

    for u, v in edges:

        nodes.add(u)

        nodes.add(v)

    unique_nodes = list(nodes)

    size = len(unique_nodes)

    if size ==0:

        continue  # but edges are non-empty? No.

    # create DSU

    node_to_idx = {u: i for i, u in enumerate(unique_nodes)}

    parent = list(range(size))

    rank = [1]*size

    count = size

    for u, v in edges:

        u_idx = node_to_idx[u]

        v_idx = node_to_idx[v]

        # find roots

        root_u = u_idx

        while parent[root_u] != root_u:

            parent[root_u] = parent[parent[root_u]]

            root_u = parent[root_u]

        root_v = v_idx

        while parent[root_v] != root_v:

            parent[root_v] = parent[parent[root_v]]

            root_v = parent[root_v]

        if root_u != root_v:

            if rank[root_u] > rank[root_v]:

                parent[root_v] = root_u

            else:

                parent[root_u] = root_v

                if rank[root_u] == rank[root_v]:

                    rank[root_v] +=1

            count -=1

    term = (pow_2n - pow(2, count, MOD)) % MOD

    sum_terms = (sum_terms + term) % MOD

total = (pow(2, n +k, MOD) - sum_terms) % MOD

print(total)

But wait, for the case when n=0, but according to the problem constraints, n>=1.

But in code, when n is 1, m can be 0.

Another thing: pow(2, n +k, MOD) is computed as pow(2, n, MOD) * pow(2, k, MOD) mod MOD, but since n and k can be up to 5e5 and 60, respectively, the sum n +k is up to 5e5+60, which is manageable with pow(2, n +k, MOD).

But Python's pow can handle exponents up to 1e18 efficiently.

So the code should work.

Let's test the first sample:

Sample 1:

Input:

4 4 2

0 1 0 1

1 2

2 3

3 4

4 1

The edges are converted to 0-based for c, but edges are stored as 1-based for nodes.

Wait, no: in code, after reading u and v, they are converted to 0-based for c (since c is 0-based), but the edges are stored as 1-based. For example, the first edge is 1-2 (original input), then u becomes 0 (1-1) and v becomes 1 (2-1). The d is c[0] XOR c[1] =0^1=1. So the edge is stored in groups[1] as (0+1, 1+1) = (1,2). Wait, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, code:

u and v are read from input as 1-based (e.g., input says 1 and 2 for first edge). Then, code does:

u -=1, v -=1. So u and v are 0-based for c array. Then, d is c[u] XOR c[v]. So for the first edge, u=0, v=1. c[0] is 0, c[1] is 1. d=1. Then, groups[d].append( (u+1, v+1) ), which becomes (1,2). So the edges are stored in 1-based node numbers.

So in the group for d=1, the edges are (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,1) (original edges in 1-based).

Processing this group:

Collect all nodes: 1,2,3,4.

size=4. count=4.

Process each edge:

1-2: union(0,1). count becomes 3.

2-3: union(1,2). count becomes 2.

3-4: union(2,3). count becomes 1.

4-1: union(3,0). But find(3) is 3. find(0) is 0. So union 3 and 0. count becomes 0? Wait, after processing the first three edges:

After 1-2: count 3.

After 2-3: count 2.

After 3-4: count 1.

Then edge 4-1 (3 and 0 in the DSU array). The nodes 4 is stored as index 3 in the unique_nodes list (sorted as 1,2,3,4). So in the DSU, 4 is index 3, and 1 is index 0.

So when processing edge (4,1), which is (4,1) in the group's edges. These are nodes 4 and 1. Their indices are 3 and 0.

root_u is 3 (parent[3] is 3), root_v is 0 (parent[0] is 0). So they are merged. count decreases to 0.

So count is 0. c_d is 0. term is (16 - 1) =15. But sample's sum_terms is 14. Wait, but sample's group is processed as follows:

Wait, no. In the sample, the group's edges form a cycle. After processing all edges, all nodes are connected into one component. So count is 1. So why in our code for this group, count is 0?

Ah, I see a mistake here. The code is initializing count as the size of the unique_nodes list (4), and each union reduces the count. For the four edges:

After 1-2: count 3.

After 2-3: count 2.

After 3-4: count 1.

After 4-1: count 0.

But this is impossible. Because after processing all four edges, the four nodes form a single component. So count should be 1. But according to the code, count becomes 0.

What's wrong here?

Wait, count is initialized as size (4). Each successful union reduces count by 1. For four edges:

Each edge is processed. The first three edges: each is a successful union (merge two components into one). So after three edges, count is 4-3=1. The fourth edge (4-1) is between 4 and 1, which are in the same component as the previous three edges. So the fourth edge's union does nothing. So count remains 1.

So the code's processing is incorrect. Oh right! The code is processing all edges, including the fourth edge which connects two already connected nodes. So the fourth edge's union is unsuccessful. So count is decremented only for the first three edges, and the fourth edge doesn't affect it.

But why in the code above, the fourth edge (4-1) is processed as follows:

The code's count is 1 after processing the first three edges. Then, processing the fourth edge (4 and 1):

In the DSU, after three edges, all nodes are connected. So when processing the fourth edge, the roots of 3 (node 4) and 0 (node 1) are already in the same component.

So the code's count remains 1.

Ah, there's a mistake in the code's logic. The code was written with the variables u_idx and v_idx, but perhaps the DSU implementation is incorrect.

Wait, the code uses path compression, but perhaps the way the DSU is implemented leads to incorrect root finding. Let's recheck.

The code's find function is implemented with path compression. For each find(u_idx), it updates the parent array to point to the grandparent. So in the code, the loop:

root_u = u_idx

while parent[root_u] != root_u:

    parent[root_u] = parent[parent[root_u]]

    root_u = parent[root_u]

This correctly finds the root and applies path compression during the find.

Wait, no. The loop:

Initially, parent[root_u] is parent[u_idx]. The loop continues until parent[root_u] equals root_u.

But the code sets root_u to parent[root_u], not parent[parent[root_u]].

Wait, the code's find is not implemented correctly. The standard path compression implementation in a find function is:

def find(u):

    if parent[u] != u:

        parent[u] = find(parent[u])

    return parent[u]

But in the code, the find is implemented with a loop, but the path compression is applied by setting parent[root_u] to the grandparent each time.

Wait, in the code, the find for u_idx is:

root_u = u_idx

while parent[root_u] != root_u:

    parent[root_u] = parent[parent[root_u]]

    root_u = parent[root_u]

This is incorrect. Because parent[root_u] is set to parent[parent[root_u]] during the traversal. But the loop does not update the parent of all nodes along the path. For example, suppose the path is u_idx -> a -> b -> root. The code will first set parent[a] = parent[b], then root_u becomes a. Then, check if parent[a] is a. If not, repeat.

This is not the correct way to do path compression. The code as written may not correctly find the root, leading to incorrect connected component counts.

Ah, here's the problem. The code's find implementation is incorrect. The code's DSU implementation is flawed, leading to incorrect counts of connected components.

This explains why the first sample's code would process the fourth edge (4-1) and not detect that they are in the same component, leading to an incorrect count.

So the code needs a correct find function with path compression.

Therefore, the DSU implementation in the code is incorrect. The correct way to implement find with path compression is recursively or using a loop that fully compresses the path.

So the code's DSU is the problem.

To fix this, we need to reimplement the find function correctly.

Alternatively, let's rewrite the code's DSU with a correct find function.

Let me adjust the code.

For each group:

We can create a helper find function that uses path compression.

But in the code as written, during each find, the parent is updated to point to the grandparent. This is a form of path compression (known as path splitting), but it may not fully compress the path. So for example, if the path is long, this code may not set the parent of u directly to the root. Hence, subsequent find operations will have to traverse multiple steps.

This may lead to incorrect root lookups in some cases.

For example, consider nodes A->B->C->D (parent pointers). When find(A) is called, the code updates A's parent to B's parent (C), then B's parent to C's parent (D), and so on. This is path splitting, but the root for A is now D. However, the code would have to iterate again to find the root.

This could result in incorrect root detection, leading to incorrect unions.

So, the DSU implementation in the code is flawed, leading to incorrect connected components count.

To fix this, the find function should be properly implemented with path compression.

In Python, for each group, we can use a list-based DSU with path compression in the find function.

Let's reimplement the find function.

For each node's index in the group, the parent array holds the parent index.

The find function for a node's index:

def find(u):

    while parent[u] != u:

        parent[u] = parent[parent[u]]  # path splitting

        u = parent[u]

    return u

Or, alternatively, a recursive approach with full path compression.

But in code, since recursion is not feasible for large n, the loop-based approach is better.

So modifying the code's find part:

For each edge (u, v):

    u_idx = node_to_idx[u]

    v_idx = node_to_idx[v]

    # find root for u_idx

    root_u = u_idx

    while parent[root_u] != root_u:

        parent[root_u] = parent[parent[root_u]]

        root_u = parent[root_u]

    # find root for v_idx

    root_v = v_idx

    while parent[root_v] != root_v:

        parent[root_v] = parent[parent[root_v]]

        root_v = parent[root_v]

    if root_u != root_v:

        # perform union

        if rank[root_u] > rank[root_v]:

            parent[root_v] = root_u

        else:

            parent[root_u] = root_v

            if rank[root_u] == rank[root_v]:

                rank[root_v] +=1

        count -=1

This is the correct find implementation with path splitting, which is one of the path compression techniques. So this should correctly find the root.

But in the first sample, after processing the first three edges:

Edge 1-2: u=1, v=2. After processing, parents are [0,0,2,3]. count=3.

Edge 2-3: u=2, v=3. u_idx is 1 (node 2's index is 1), v_idx is 2 (node 3's index is 2).

find(1):

parent[1] is 0. parent[0] is 0. So root_u is 0.

find(2):

parent[2] is 2. So root_v is 2. They are different, so union. parent[2] is set to 0. rank[0] was 1, rank[2] was 1. So rank[0] becomes 2. count is 3-1=2.

Edge 3-4: u=3, v=4. u_idx is 2 (node 3), v_idx is 3 (node 4).

find(2):

parent[2] is 0. root_u is 0.

find(3):

parent[3] is 3. So root_v is 3. Union. parent[3] =0. count becomes 2-1=1.

Edge 4-1: u=4 (index 3), v=1 (index 0).

find(3):

parent[3] is 0. parent[0] is 0. root_u is 0.

find(0):

parent[0] is 0. root_v is 0. So no union. count remains 1.

So after processing all four edges, count is 1. term is (16 - 2^1) =14. sum_terms is 14.

The total answer is 64-14=50, which matches the sample.

So the code's DSU was incorrect earlier, but with the correct find implementation, it works.

So the code needs to correctly implement the find function with path compression.

Thus, the code should now work correctly.
