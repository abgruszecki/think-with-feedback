Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum number of moves needed to sort the train by moving cars to either the beginning or the end. Each move allows taking a car and placing it at the start or end. The goal is to minimize these moves.

Hmm. The key here is probably finding the longest consecutive increasing subsequence. Because those cars that are already in a consecutive increasing order don't need to be moved. The rest would have to be moved. Wait, right. For example, if there's a sequence like 1, 2, 3, then those can stay in place. The longest such sequence would determine the maximum number of cars we don't have to move, so the answer would be n minus that length.

Wait, but the consecutive sequence has to be in order. Like, each next element is exactly one more than the previous. Because that's how the sorted array would be. So for example, if the current array has a part like 2,3,4, that's a consecutive sequence. The longer this sequence, the fewer moves we need.

So the problem reduces to finding the maximum length of a consecutive increasing subsequence (where each next element is current +1). Then the minimum moves would be n minus this length.

But how to compute that efficiently for large n (like 1e5)?

Let's think. For each element, we can track the length of the consecutive sequence ending at that element. For example, for element x, the length would be 1 + the length of x-1. So we can use a hash map (dictionary) to store for each x the maximum length of consecutive sequence up to x.

Wait, this is similar to the problem of finding the longest consecutive sequence in an array, but here the order of the array matters. Because the sequence has to appear in the array in order. Oh, right! Because in the array, the elements have to form a consecutive sequence in the order they appear, not just any sequence. So for example, if the array is [4,1,2,5,3], the longest such consecutive sequence is 1,2,3. Wait, but 1,2,5 is not consecutive. But the correct example input here is 4 1 2 5 3. The correct output is 2. Let's see: The sorted array is 1 2 3 4 5. The longest consecutive sequence in the input array is 1,2,3 (since 3 comes after 5). Wait, but in the input array, the order is 1,2,5,3. So 1,2 is consecutive, but then 5 is not part of it. Then 3 comes after 5, which is 2+1. So the consecutive sequence here is 1,2,3. But how? Because in the array, 5 is between 2 and 3. So the actual positions are 1 (position 2), 2 (position3), 5 (position4), 3 (position5). So the consecutive sequence is 1,2,3, but they are not in order. Wait, but the order in the array must have the consecutive elements appearing in the right order. Wait, no. Because the problem is to find the longest sequence of consecutive numbers that are in order. So for example, if the array is [3,4,2,1], the longest consecutive sequence is 3,4, which is length 2. Then the answer would be n-2=2 moves.

So in the first example input:

The array is [4,1,2,5,3]. The sorted array is 1,2,3,4,5.

Looking for the longest consecutive sequence in the current array where each next element is exactly +1. The elements 1,2,5: here 5 is not +1. Then 1,2,3: yes. So the consecutive sequence is 1,2,3. But in the array, 3 comes after 5. So how is that possible? Because the elements must be in order in the array. So the positions of 1,2,3 in the array are index 1, 2, and 4. So they are in order. So the sequence is 1,2,3, which is consecutive. So their positions in the array are in order, and their values are consecutive. So the length is 3. So the answer is 5-3=2, which matches the sample.

So the problem is to find the maximum length of such a consecutive increasing subsequence in the array. Then the answer is n - maximum length.

So the approach is:

1. For each element in the array, record the position of each value. For example, create a dictionary where key is the value, and value is its index in the array.

2. Then, iterate through the elements in the array, and for each element, check the longest consecutive sequence starting from it. Wait, no. Because the sequence can start from any element and the elements must be consecutive and in order.

Alternatively, for each value x in the array, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence ending at x. For example, if x-1 is present in the array and comes before x, then the length is length[x-1] + 1. Otherwise, it's 1.

But how do we process this efficiently?

Another idea: Since the elements are unique and range from 1 to n, perhaps we can precompute the positions of each element. Then for each element x, the maximum possible consecutive sequence ending at x would be 1 + the maximum consecutive sequence ending at x-1, provided that x-1 occurs before x in the array.

So for example, in the array [4,1,2,5,3], the positions are:

4: 0

1:1

2:2

5:3

3:4

So for x=1, x-1 is 0 (not present), so length is 1.

x=2, x-1=1 is at position 1, which is before x=2's position 2. So length is 1 (x-1's length) +1=2.

x=3, x-1=2 is at position 2, which is before x=3's position 4. So length is 2 (length of x=2) +1=3.

x=4: x-1=3 is at position 4, which is after x=4's position 0. So cannot use it. So length is 1.

x=5: x-1=4 is at position 0, which is before x=5's position 3. So length is 1 (x=4's length is 1) +1=2.

So the maximum length is 3 (from x=3). So the answer is 5-3=2.

So the plan is:

- Create a dictionary pos that maps each element to its index.

- Initialize a dictionary (like dp) to store the length of the longest consecutive sequence ending at x.

- For each x in the array in order:

   if x-1 exists in pos, and pos[x-1] < pos[x], then dp[x] = dp[x-1] + 1

   else, dp[x] = 1

- Keep track of the maximum dp[x] found.

- The answer is n - max_length.

Yes, this seems correct.

So for the first example, the dp would be:

4: dp[4] =1 (since 3 is not present)

1: dp[1]=1 (0 not present)

2: dp[2] = dp[1]+1=2

5: dp[5] = dp[4]+1=2

3: dp[3] = dp[2]+1=3

max is 3. So 5-3=2.

Another example: input 4 is [4,1,3,2]. The sorted array is 1,2,3,4.

The pos is 4:0, 1:1,3:2,2:3.

Processing each element:

4: dp[4]=1 (x-1=3 is not present? Wait, x is 4, x-1 is 3. But 3 is in the array. So check if pos[3] < pos[4].

pos[3] is 2, which is larger than pos[4] (0). So no. So dp[4] =1.

1: x-1 is 0, which is not present. dp[1] =1.

3: x-1 is 2. Is pos[2] present? Wait, the elements are 4,1,3,2. So x is 3 here. x-1 is 2. pos[2] is 3, which is after pos[3] (2). So no. So dp[3] =1.

2: x-1 is 1. pos[1] is 1, which is before pos[2] (3). So dp[2] = dp[1]+1=2.

So the max is 2 (from 2 and 1). So answer is 4-2=2, which matches the sample.

So this approach works.

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

Given that n can be up to 1e5, we need O(n) time and space.

The steps are:

1. Read the array, create a dictionary pos where pos[x] = index in the array.

2. Iterate through the array, for each x in order:

   check if x-1 is in pos.

   if yes, and pos[x-1] < current index (since x's index is current), then dp[x] = dp[x-1] +1

   else, dp[x] =1

3. Keep track of the maximum dp value.

Finally, the answer is n - max_dp.

Yes.

In code:

We can process the array elements in order. For each element x, check if x-1 exists. If it does, and its position is less than the current element's position, then the current element can extend the sequence ending at x-1.

So, let's code this.

But how to handle the positions. For each x in the array, during processing, we can get its position. So perhaps, when we read the array as p, then for i in range(n), pos[p[i]] = i.

Yes.

Then, for each x in p:

current index is pos[x].

Check if x-1 is in pos. If yes, then pos[x-1] < pos[x]?

If yes, then the current length is dp[x-1] +1.

So, for example, when processing x=3 in the first sample, pos[x] is 4. x-1=2 is in pos, and pos[2]=2 <4, so dp[3] = dp[2]+1 = 2+1=3.

So, we need a dictionary to store dp for each x.

But since x can be up to 1e5, but in Python, using a dictionary with keys up to 1e5 is manageable.

So the code steps:

Read n.

Read the array p.

pos = {x: i for i, x in enumerate(p)}

dp = {}

max_len = 0

for x in p:

    prev = x -1

    if prev in pos and pos[prev] < pos[x]:

        dp[x] = dp.get(prev, 0) +1

    else:

        dp[x] =1

    if dp[x] > max_len:

        max_len = dp[x]

answer = n - max_len

print(answer)

Wait, but in the first sample, when x is 5, we check x-1=4. pos[4] is 0 <3 (pos[5] is 3?), wait the first sample's array is [4,1,2,5,3]. So pos is:

4:0

1:1

2:2

5:3

3:4

So when x=5, prev is 4. pos[4] is 0, which is less than 3 (pos[5] is 3). So dp[5] = dp[4] +1. But dp[4] was set when processing x=4 (the first element in p). So when x=4 is processed (the first element in the loop), prev is 3. Since 3 is not in pos (initially, pos is built after processing all elements?), wait no. Wait, pos is a dictionary built before the loop, right? Because we first read the entire array and build the pos dictionary.

Yes. So for the first sample, when processing x=4 (the first element in the array), prev is 3. pos does not have 3, because in the array, 3 is at the end. So pos[3] is 4. But when we are processing x=4, the pos dictionary is already built. So for x=4, prev is 3, which is in pos (since all elements are added to pos before the loop). Wait no. Wait, in the array, the elements are 4,1,2,5,3. So when building pos, for each element, the index is stored. So pos[4] is 0, pos[1] is 1, etc. So when processing x=4 (the first element), prev is 3. Is 3 in pos? No, because in the array, 3 is the last element. Wait, no: in the array, the elements are 4,1,2,5,3. So pos[3] is 4, because the index of 3 is 4. So when x=4 is processed, x-1=3. Is 3 in pos? Yes. Because pos is built after the entire array is read. So pos has all elements as keys.

So for x=4, prev is 3. pos[3] is 4. pos[x] (pos[4] is 0). So pos[3] (4) is greater than pos[4] (0). So the condition (prev in pos and pos[prev] < pos[x]) is false, because 4 is not less than 0. So dp[4] is set to 1.

Similarly, when processing x=5 (the fourth element in the array), prev is 4. pos[4] is 0 <3 (pos[5] is3). So yes. So dp[5] = dp[4] +1. dp[4] is 1, so dp[5] is 2. So that's correct.

So the code seems correct.

But what about when the elements are in reverse order?

For example, if the array is [3,2,1]. The pos dictionary is 3:0, 2:1, 1:2.

Processing x=3: prev=2 is in pos. pos[2] is1, which is greater than 0. So condition is false. dp[3] =1.

x=2: prev=1. pos[1] is2 >1. So condition false. dp[2]=1.

x=1: prev=0 not present. dp[1] =1.

max_len is 1. answer is 3-1=2. Which is correct. The optimal way is to move 3 to the end (one move), then 2 to the end (another move). So total 2.

Yes.

Another test case: array [1,2,3,4]. Then the max_len is4. answer 0. Correct.

So the code seems to handle these cases.

But wait, the code iterates through each x in p, in the order of the array. So when processing x, the previous x-1 may have already been processed. But for x's that come later, their x-1 may have a higher index. Wait, but the pos[x-1] is the index in the array. For example, if the array is [2,1,3,4]. Then the pos of 1 is1, which is after the pos of2 (0). So when processing 2 (x=2), x-1=1 is in pos, but pos[1] is1 >0. So the condition is false. So dp[2] is1. When processing x=1 (index1), x-1=0 not present. So dp[1]=1. x=3: x-1=2 is in pos, pos[2] is0 <2 (pos[3] is2). So dp[3] = dp[2]+1=2. x=4: x-1=3, which is pos[3] 2 <3 (pos[4] is3). So dp[4] =3. Max_len is3. answer is4-3=1. Which is correct. The optimal way is to move 1 to the beginning (so the sequence becomes 1,2,3,4). Or maybe move 2 to the end. Wait, the array is [2,1,3,4]. The longest consecutive sequence is 1,3,4 (but no, because 3 is not 1+1=2). Wait, the code would find the maximum consecutive sequence. Let's see:

Processing x=2: dp[2]=1.

x=1: dp[1]=1.

x=3: x-1=2 is in pos, but pos[2] is0 <2 (pos[3] is2). So dp[3] = dp[2]+1=2.

x=4: x-1=3, pos is3. pos[3] is2 <3. So dp[4] =2+1=3. So max_len is3. So answer is4-3=1. Which is correct. The correct move is to move 2 to the end. Then the array becomes [1,3,4,2]. Then move 2 to the end again. Wait, no. Wait, original array is [2,1,3,4]. The longest consecutive sequence is 2,3,4 (values 2,3,4, indices 0,2,3). So the code gives a max_len of3. So answer is1. So how?

Ah, the longest consecutive sequence is 2,3,4. So those three can stay, and 1 needs to be moved. So 1 move. Which is correct.

But how? Because the array is [2,1,3,4]. The sorted array is [1,2,3,4]. The optimal way is to move the 1 to the beginning. So one move. So the answer is correct.

So the code works.

Another test case: array [3,4,2,1]. The longest consecutive sequence is 3,4. So answer is4-2=2. Which is correct.

Thus, the approach seems solid.

Now, considering the constraints. For n up to 1e5, the code will run in O(n) time, which is acceptable.

In Python, dictionaries can handle 1e5 elements without problem. So the code should work.

So the code would be:

Read n.

Read list p.

pos = {x:i for i, x in enumerate(p)}

dp = {}

max_len =0

for x in p:

    prev = x-1

    if prev in pos and pos[prev] < pos[x]:

        dp[x] = dp.get(prev, 0) +1

    else:

        dp[x] =1

    if dp[x] > max_len:

        max_len = dp[x]

print(n - max_len)

Wait, but in the code, when we process x in the array p, we check prev in pos. But pos contains all elements, so prev (x-1) may or may not be present.

Yes.

Testing sample input 1:

Input is 5 4 1 2 5 3.

Processing x=4 (prev 3 is in pos? pos[3] is4 (the index of 3 in the array is4). pos[4] is0. So 4>0, so condition is false. dp[4] =1.

x=1: prev 0 not in pos. dp[1]=1.

x=2: prev 1 is in pos (pos[1] is1). pos[1] < pos[2] (1<2). So dp[2] = dp[1] (1) +1=2. max_len is 2.

x=5: prev 4 is in pos. pos[4] is0 <3. So dp[5] = dp[4] (1) +1=2. max_len remains 2.

x=3: prev 2 is in pos. pos[2] is2 <4. So dp[3] = dp[2] (2) +1=3. max_len becomes3. So answer is5-3=2. Correct.

Yes.

Another test case:

Sample 2:

Input is 4 4 1 3 2.

Processing x=4: prev 3 is in pos (index2). pos[3] is2 <0? No. So dp[4]=1.

x=1: prev 0 not present. dp=1.

x=3: prev 2 is in pos (index3). pos[2]=3 >2 (pos[3] is2). So no. dp[3]=1.

x=2: prev 1 is in pos (index1). pos[1]=1 <3. So dp[2] = dp[1]+1=2. max_len=2. Answer is4-2=2. Correct.

Yes.

Thus, the code works for the samples.

Therefore, this code should be correct.
