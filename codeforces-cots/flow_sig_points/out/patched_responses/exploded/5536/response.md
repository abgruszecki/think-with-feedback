Okay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to compute the sum of next(x) for all x from l to r inclusive. Next(x) is the smallest lucky number (composed of 4s and 7s) that is >= x. 

First, I need to understand how to efficiently generate all possible lucky numbers and find the next(x) for any given x. Since l and r can be up to 1e9, iterating each number from l to r and computing next(x) each time would be too slow. That approach would have O(r - l + 1) time, which could be up to 1e9 operationsâ€”way too slow for the time limit. So we need a smarter way.

So the key idea here is to precompute all possible lucky numbers and then for each interval between two consecutive lucky numbers, calculate how many numbers in [l, r] fall into that interval and sum the product of the lucky number and the count of numbers in that range.

For example, suppose we have lucky numbers sorted in ascending order: a1, a2, ..., an. Then for any x between a_i and a_{i+1}-1, next(x) is a_{i+1} if x is >= a_i and < a_{i+1}? Wait, no. Wait, next(x) is the minimal lucky number >=x. So for x in [a_i, a_{i+1}-1], next(x) is a_i if x <= a_i, but wait, a_i is the next one. Wait, the list of lucky numbers is sorted. So, for a given x, we need to find the smallest lucky number that is >=x. So the list of lucky numbers must be sorted in ascending order, and for x, we can binary search to find the first lucky number >=x.

Once all lucky numbers are generated and sorted, we can split the interval [l, r] into ranges where each range is covered by a single lucky number. Then, the sum is the sum of (upper - lower + 1) * lucky_number for each such range that overlaps with [l, r].

So the steps are:

1. Generate all lucky numbers up to a certain maximum. Since the maximum x can be 1e9, the largest lucky number we need to generate would be the smallest one that is >=1e9. For example, 777777777 (if that's 9 digits) but maybe even larger. Wait, 4444444444 is a 10-digit number, which is 4 followed by 9 4s. Wait, let's see. For x=1e9, the next(x) would be 4444444444 (since 1e9 is 1 followed by 9 zeros, the next lucky number would be 4444444444, which is 10 digits). So all possible lucky numbers up to, say, 10 digits need to be generated.

How to generate all possible lucky numbers? They can be generated by recursively building numbers with digits 4 and 7. For each possible length from 1 to, say, 10 digits, generate all combinations of 4s and 7s. Then collect all these numbers, sort them, and that's our list.

So the first step is to generate all such numbers. The total number of such numbers for up to 10 digits is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^10 = 2*(2^10 -1) = 2046. That's manageable.

Once we have this list sorted, the next step is to find for each x in [l, r], the next lucky number. But since doing this for each x is O(1) per query with a binary search, but there are up to 1e9 numbers, that's not feasible. So instead, we need to find the ranges where next(x) is the same for consecutive x's.

For example, between lucky numbers a and b, all x >=a and <b would have next(x) as a. But wait, no. Wait, the lucky numbers are sorted. So for example, a is the first lucky number >=x. So, for x between a_i and a_{i+1}-1, the next(x) is a_i. Wait, no. Wait, if a_i is the next lucky number >=x, but if x is larger than a_i but less than a_{i+1}, then next(x) would still be a_{i+1} if x is between a_i and a_{i+1} -1? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, suppose the lucky numbers are sorted as a0, a1, a2, ... in increasing order. Then, for any x in [a_i, a_{i+1} -1], the next(x) is a_i. Because a_i is the smallest lucky number >=x. Because a_{i+1} is larger than a_i. So for example, if a_i is 4, a_{i+1} is 7, then for x=5, next(x) is 7, right? Wait, 5 is between 4 and 7-1 (6), so x=5 is in [4,6], but next(x) is 7. Wait, that's a problem. Because according to that logic, a_i would be 4, and the next is 7. But 4 is the next(x) for x=4, but for x=5 and 6, next(x) is 7.

So that approach of the ranges being [a_i, a_{i+1}-1] is incorrect. Hmm.

So the correct way is: each a_i covers the range from (a_{i-1}, a_i], where a_{i-1} is the previous lucky number. So for example, a_i is the next(x) for x in (a_{i-1}, a_i].

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose the lucky numbers are 4,7,44,47,74,77, etc. So for x=4, next(x) is 4. For x=5, next(x) is 7. For x=7, it's 7. For x=8, next(x) is 44. So the ranges would be:

Between 4 (inclusive) and 7 (exclusive) -> next(x) is 4 (but wait, no. For x=4, it's 4. For x=5,6, next(x) is 7. So that approach is wrong.

Ah, right. So the way to model it is that each a_i is the next(x) for x in [prev+1, a_i], where prev is the previous a_{i-1}.

Wait, no. Let's see. The sorted list of lucky numbers is:

4,7,44,47,74,77,444,447,474, etc.

So for x from 1 to 4: next(x) is 4.

For x from 5 to 7: next(x) is 7.

For x from 8 to 44: next(x) is 44.

And so on.

So the ranges are:

next(x) = a_i for x in [a_{i-1}+1, a_i], where a_0 is 0. Because after a_{i-1} (the previous lucky number) up to a_i, the next(x) is a_i. For example, after 7 (a_1) comes 44 (a_2). So x from 8 to 44 (inclusive) would have next(x) 44.

So the idea is to generate all the intervals between consecutive lucky numbers and then see how the [l, r] interval overlaps with each of these intervals.

So for each consecutive pair of lucky numbers (prev, curr), the numbers in (prev, curr] have next(x) as curr. Wait, no. Because for x=4, next is 4. Then x=5-6, next is 7. So after 4 (prev=4), the next is 7 (curr=7). So the numbers in (prev, curr] would be 5-7, but for x=7, next is 7. So the range is (prev, curr], but prev is the previous lucky number.

So the ranges are:

For the first lucky number (4), the range is [4,4], next(x) is 4.

Then the next lucky number (7) covers x from (4,7], which is 5,6,7. For those x, next(x) is 7.

Then the next lucky number (44) covers x from (7,44], which is 8-44, so next(x) is 44.

So the general approach is:

- The list of lucky numbers is sorted in ascending order.

- Each lucky number a_i covers a range of x values. The first lucky number (a_0) covers x in [a_0, a_0]. Then each subsequent a_i covers x in (a_{i-1}, a_i].

So, to compute the sum for [l, r], we can:

1. Generate all the lucky numbers, sorted.

2. Prepend 0 to the list to handle the first interval (since the first interval starts at 1 up to a_0=4). Wait, no. Let's see. The first interval is [1,4] where next(x) is 4. But according to the previous logic, the first a_i is 4, which covers x in (0,4], i.e., x <=4. Wait, if we prepend 0 to the list, then the first interval would be (0,4], which is x=1-4. That works.

So the list of lucky numbers after being sorted would be [4,7,44,47, ...]. Prepend 0 to create a list [0,4,7,44,47,...]. Then for each consecutive pair (prev, curr), the interval (prev, curr] is covered by curr. So for example, (0,4] is 1-4: next(x) is 4. Then (4,7] is 5-7: next(x) is7. Then (7,44] is 8-44: next(x) is44, etc.

So, the algorithm would be:

- Generate all lucky numbers, sort them, prepend 0.

- Then, for each consecutive pair (prev, curr) in this list:

   - Determine the overlap between the interval (prev, curr] and [l, r].

   - If there's an overlap, compute the number of elements in the overlap and multiply by curr, adding to the sum.

So, the steps are:

1. Generate all possible lucky numbers (digits 4 and 7 in all possible lengths up to say 10 digits).

   For that, recursively generate all combinations. For example, for each length from 1 to 10, generate all possible numbers with 4 and 7 in each digit.

2. Sort the list of lucky numbers in ascending order.

3. Prepend 0 to the list to handle the first interval.

4. Iterate through each pair of consecutive lucky numbers (prev, curr).

   For each pair:

   - The interval is (prev, curr].

   - The start of this interval is prev + 1, the end is curr.

   - The overlap with [l, r] is max(start, l) to min(end, r).

   - If max(start, l) > min(end, r), there's no overlap. Otherwise, the count is (min(end, r) - max(start, l) + 1), and the contribution is count * curr.

   Add all these contributions to the sum.

So the sum is the sum over all intervals overlapping with [l, r] of (number of elements in overlap) * curr.

Now, how to generate all lucky numbers. Let's see:

We can generate them using a BFS approach. For example, start with digits 4 and 7, then for each existing number, append 4 and 7, building all possible numbers. Alternatively, we can use a recursive approach where for each step, we build numbers with length increasing by 1. For example, for length 1: 4,7. Length 2:44,47,74,77. Length 3: 444,447,474,477,744, etc.

We can generate all possible numbers up to 10 digits, which is 2^10 = 1024 per digit length. But 10 digits would be 4 followed by 9 4's: 4444444444 which is 4444444444, which is 4,444,444,444 (about 4.4 billion). But since the input can be up to 1e9, and 4.4e9 is larger than 1e9, the next(x) for 1e9 would be 4444444444. So generating up to 10 digits is sufficient.

Wait, but maybe even larger numbers. For example, 1e9 is 1,000,000,000. The next lucky number after that would be 4444444444 (which is 4,444,444,444) which is 10 digits. So generating all lucky numbers up to 10 digits is sufficient.

So the code for generating all lucky numbers can be:

Initialize a list. Start with numbers 4 and 7. Then, for each existing number, append 4 and 7 to it, creating new numbers. Repeat this until the numbers have up to 10 digits. Collect all these numbers, then sort them.

Alternatively, use a BFS approach to generate numbers of increasing length. For example:

def generate_lucky_numbers():
    nums = []
    from collections import deque
    q = deque()
    q.append(4)
    q.append(7)
    while q:
        num = q.popleft()
        nums.append(num)
        # append 4 and 7 to the current number
        next_num_4 = num * 10 + 4
        next_num_7 = num * 10 + 7
        # only add if they have <=10 digits?
        # for example, 4 and 7 are 1-digit, then 44,47, etc. 10 digits would be 4 followed by 9 4s.
        if next_num_4 <= 10**10:  # arbitrary large number to capture all needed
            q.append(next_num_4)
            q.append(next_num_7)
    return sorted(nums)

Wait, but this approach would generate numbers in a certain order. For example, 4,7,44,47,74,77,444, etc. Then when sorted, they would be in the correct order. But perhaps using BFS would generate numbers in the order of their length, so 4,7 (length 1), then 44,47,74,77 (length 2), then 444, etc. So the list after sorting would be correct. But when we generate all possible numbers, we can collect them all and sort, which is manageable.

But when we generate numbers via BFS, the order is not sorted, so we need to collect all numbers and then sort them.

But for numbers up to 10 digits, there are 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^10 = 2^11 -2 = 2046 numbers, which is manageable.

Once generated, sorted, and prepended with 0, the list is ready.

Now, the code steps:

Generate the list, sort, prepend 0.

Then, iterate through consecutive pairs (prev, curr). For each pair, compute the overlap with [l, r].

Now, how to compute the overlap.

For example, the interval (prev, curr] is (prev, curr]. So the start is prev +1, end is curr.

The overlapping with [l, r] is:

overlap_start = max(prev +1, l)

overlap_end = min(curr, r)

if overlap_start > overlap_end: no overlap.

Else: count = overlap_end - overlap_start +1

sum += count * curr

So in code:

sum = 0

prev_list = [0] + sorted_lucky_numbers

for i in range(len(prev_list)-1):

    prev = prev_list[i]

    curr = prev_list[i+1]

    start = prev +1

    end = curr

    # compute overlap with [l, r]

    overlap_start = max(start, l)

    overlap_end = min(end, r)

    if overlap_start > overlap_end:

        continue

    count = overlap_end - overlap_start +1

    sum += count * curr

return sum

But wait, what about the case when l is less than the first lucky number?

Wait, for example, if l=2 and r=7. The first interval is (0,4], which is 1-4. Then next is (4,7], 5-7. Then (7,44], etc.

So in this example, l=2 is in (0,4], which is start=1, end=4. Overlap with [2,4] is 3 numbers (2,3,4) each next(x) is 4. Then the next interval is (4,7], start=5, end=7. Overlap with [5,7] is 3 numbers (5,6,7) each next is7. So total sum is 3*4 +3*7=12+21=33, which matches the first sample.

Yes, this works.

Another test case: 7,7. The interval (4,7] includes 7. So overlap is (5-7) and r=7. So start is max(5,7) =7, end is min(7,7) =7. count is 1. sum +=7*1=7. Correct.

So the code should handle this.

Now, the code steps in Python:

Read l and r.

Generate all lucky numbers, sorted, then prepend 0.

Iterate through consecutive pairs.

For each pair, calculate the interval (prev+1, curr] and find overlap with [l, r].

Now, generating the lucky numbers.

Alternative approach: generate all possible numbers by considering all combinations of 4 and 7 in digits up to 10.

We can generate all possible combinations of 4 and 7 for each possible length (1 to 10 digits). For each length, generate all 2^length numbers. For example, for length 3, there are 8 possibilities (444, 447,474,477,744,747,774,777).

So code to generate all possible numbers:

def generate_all_lucky_numbers():

    numbers = []

    from itertools import product

    for length in range(1, 11):  # up to 10 digits

        for bits in product(['4','7'], repeat=length):

            num = int(''.join(bits))

            numbers.append(num)

    numbers = sorted(numbers)

    return numbers

This would generate all possible numbers with 1 to 10 digits. For each length, generate all possible combinations of 4 and 7.

But product can be slow for up to 10 digits. 2^10=1024 per digit length, and for 10 digits, 1024 numbers. For 10 digit lengths, that's 10*1024=10,240 numbers. Wait, 1+2+3+...+10 digits? No, each digit length is handled once. So for 1 digit, 2 numbers. 2 digits, 4. 3 digits, 8. ... 10 digits, 2^10=1024 numbers. Total is sum(2^k for k in 1..10) = 2*(2^10 -1) = 2046. So manageable.

Once generated, sorted, and prepended with 0, the list is ready.

So code steps:

l, r = map(int, input().split())

Generate all lucky numbers as described.

Add 0 to the list and sort.

Then, iterate through consecutive pairs.

Compute the sum as explained.

But wait, after generating the numbers and sorting, adding 0 in front.

But in the code:

lucky = generate_all_lucky_numbers()

lucky = [0] + sorted(lucky)

But wait, the generated list is already sorted, so adding 0 and then sorting would not be correct. So the code should generate the list, sort it, then prepend 0.

Wait, no. The generated numbers are generated in order of digit length and combinations, but when you generate all of them and sort, they are in order. So after generating, we sort, then prepend 0.

Wait, for example:

Generating numbers for 1-digit: 4,7.

For 2-digits: 44,47,74,77.

When sorted, they are [4,7,44,47,74,77, ...].

So the code for generating:

def generate_lucky_numbers():

    numbers = []

    for length in range(1, 11):

        for bits in itertools.product(['4','7'], repeat=length):

            num = int(''.join(bits))

            numbers.append(num)

    numbers = sorted(numbers)

    return numbers

Yes. So numbers is sorted, then prepending 0.

But when we generate all numbers, sorted, and then prepend 0, the list becomes [0,4,7,44,47,74,77, ...].

Then, the consecutive pairs are (0,4), (4,7), (7,44), (44,47), etc.

Now, the code.

But wait, in the case where the input l is 4, then the interval (0,4] is 1-4, but 4 is included. So for x=4, it's in the first interval (prev=0, curr=4). So in that interval, the numbers are prev+1 (1) to curr (4). So x=4 is included. So next(4) is 4.

Yes.

Now, code:

Read l and r.

Generate the list.

pre = [0] + sorted(generated_list) ?

Wait, the generated_list is already sorted. So:

generated = generate_lucky_numbers()

lucky = [0] + generated

But generated is already sorted. So lucky is 0 followed by the sorted list.

Wait, but generated is sorted, so adding 0 to the front would make the first element 0, then 4,7, etc. But no, since generated is sorted as [4,7,44,47, ...], adding 0 to the front would make the list [0,4,7,44,47, ...]. Which is correct.

Yes.

Then, for each pair in lucky[i] and lucky[i+1], compute the interval.

Now, the code.

But what if the maximum generated lucky number is less than r? For example, if r is 1e9, and the generated list includes 4444444444 (which is 4444444444) which is 4.444e9, which is larger than 1e9. So any x in [l, r] would be covered by the intervals up to that number.

But in the code, after generating up to 10 digits, the list will include numbers like 4444444444, which is larger than 1e9.

So the code should handle all possible l and r up to 1e9.

Now, handling the code.

Now, in Python, the code for generating the numbers:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import itertools


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    def generate_lucky_numbers():
        nums = []
        for length in range(1, 11):
            for digits in itertools.product(('4', '7'), repeat=length):
                num = int(''.join(digits))
                nums.append(num)
        return sorted(nums)

    l, r = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    lucky = [0] + generate_lucky_numbers()
    total = 0

    for i in range(len(lucky) - 1):
        prev = lucky[i]
        curr = lucky[i+1]
        start = prev + 1
        end = curr
        overlap_start = max(start, l)
        overlap_end = min(end, r)
        if overlap_start > overlap_end:
            continue
        count = overlap_end - overlap_start + 1
        total += count * curr

    print(total, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
7 7
""",
            "output": \
"""\
7
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Another test case: 7 7. The interval for (4,7] is 5-7. Overlap is 7. Contribution 7*1=7.

So code is correct.

Another test case: l=4, r=4. Then next(x) is 4.

The code: the interval (0,4] (1-4). Overlap is 4. start is 1, end is4. overlap is max(1,4) =4, min(4,4)=4. count 1. sum 4.

Yes.

Now, code optimization.

The code as written may generate 2046 numbers (from 1-digit to 10-digit). For the loop, this is 2047 elements (including the 0 at the start), so 2047-1=2046 iterations. For each iteration, a few operations. So it's O(1) time.

Thus, the code is efficient enough.

But in Python, generating all the combinations may take some time, but since it's only 2046 elements, it's manageable.

So the code should work.

Now, the code in Python.

But wait, the code for generating the lucky numbers uses itertools.product. Let me test the code.

For example, for length=1, product generates ('4',) and ('7',). Then joined, becomes '4' and '7', converted to integers 4 and7.

For length=2, product generates ('4','4'), ('4','7'), ('7','4'), ('7','7'). So 44,47,74,77.

So yes, the code correctly generates all possible combinations.

So the code is correct.

Thus, the final code is as written.
