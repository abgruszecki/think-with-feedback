<think>
Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve, and I need to find the earliest time the boat reaches the destination based on the wind directions. Let me think through how to approach this.

The problem says that the boat can move in the direction of the wind each second, or choose to stay anchored. We need to process the wind directions in order, and find the earliest time when the cumulative movements (choosing when to move and when not to) can get us from the starting point to the endpoint.

First, let's understand the movement. The boat's position changes each second based on whether they decide to use the wind's direction. So, for each second i (from 0 to t-1), the wind direction is given, and the boat can either move in that direction or stay. The question is, what's the earliest time when the boat's position equals (ex, ey)?

So the input is a string of length t, each character being one of E, S, W, N. For each step, the boat can take that step (if it helps towards the destination) or skip it, but the order is fixed. So the key is to find the earliest time step (1-based?) where after using some subset of the first k steps, the boat reaches the destination.

Wait, but time starts at 1? Because each step is a second. So if the answer is 4, it means that after 4 seconds, they have arrived.

The output is the earliest such time. If impossible, output -1.

So the approach is to simulate the movement step by step, but track the current position and see when it reaches the destination.

But with t up to 1e5, simulating each step is O(t) time, which is acceptable.

Let's break down the problem.

First, calculate the required delta in x and y directions. The required x movement is dx = ex - sx. Similarly, dy = ey - sy.

Each wind direction contributes to either x or y. For example, E increases x by 1 if taken. N increases y by 1, etc. The boat must accumulate enough steps in each required direction.

But the steps can be taken in any order, as long as the wind direction allows. So the strategy is to process the wind sequence in order, and for each direction, decide whether taking it would help towards the required dx and dy.

Wait, but the steps must be taken in the order of the wind sequence. So for each step i (0-based?), the wind direction is known. The boat can choose to take that step (move in that direction) or not. The challenge is to find the earliest time when the sum of taken steps in each direction equals the required dx and dy.

For example, if dx is 2 (need to move east twice), then the boat must take two E winds. Similarly for dy.

So the plan is to:

1. Compute dx and dy. If dx is positive, the boat needs to take dx E steps. If negative, then W steps (since each W step decreases x by 1, which would be equivalent to moving left, but dx is ex - sx, which is negative here). Similarly for dy: positive dy needs N steps, negative needs S steps.

Wait, no. Let's think:

Suppose the destination is east of the starting point. So dx is positive. So the boat needs to move east dx times. Each E wind can contribute +1 to x. So the number of E steps needed is dx. If dx is negative, then the required steps are W steps (since each W step subtracts 1 from x, so to go from a higher x to a lower ex, need ex - sx steps in the west direction (but ex - sx is negative here, so absolute value)).

Wait, for example, if the boat starts at x=3 and wants to reach x=1, then dx is -2. So the boat needs to take two W steps.

Similarly, for dy. If dy is positive (needs to go up), then take N steps. If dy is negative (needs to go down), take S steps.

So the first thing is to check whether the total required steps for each direction (dx and dy) can be satisfied by the available wind directions.

But the steps have to be taken in the order given. So for example, even if there are enough E steps, but they are all after some point where the boat could have already arrived, but maybe the boat can't take them early.

Wait, but the boat can choose to take the steps in any order as per the wind's sequence. So, for example, the required steps must be present in the wind sequence, and in the order of the wind. So for the required E steps, the boat must take the first 'E' steps in the wind sequence up to dx times, etc.

But the boat can also choose to not take a step even if it's in a needed direction. Wait, no. Because to reach the destination, the sum of steps in each direction must exactly equal the required dx and dy. So for example, if dx is 3, then the boat needs exactly 3 E steps (or W if dx is negative), and the same for dy.

Wait, but the boat can only move when the wind direction is the same as the required direction for that component. So for dx positive, any E steps in the wind can be taken. But if dx is 3, then the boat must take 3 E steps. If there are not enough E steps in the wind, then it's impossible.

So the first check is: the number of required E/W steps (dx) and N/S steps (dy) must be <= the available counts in the wind string. For example, if dx is 3, then the number of E's must be at least 3. If dx is -2, then the number of W's must be at least 2. Similarly for dy: if dy is 4, then the number of N's must be at least 4. If dy is -3, then the number of S's must be at least 3.

If any of these are not satisfied, then the answer is -1.

So that's the first step. Let's compute the required steps.

Wait, but let's think about dx and dy. Let me compute:

dx = ex - sx

dy = ey - sy

So, if dx > 0: need to move east dx steps. So the required number of E's is dx.

If dx < 0: required number of W's is abs(dx).

Similarly for dy: if dy>0, required N's is dy. else required S's is abs(dy).

So we need to check that the wind string has at least the required number of E's (if dx>0) or W's (if dx<0). And similarly for dy.

If any of those is not met, output is -1.

Otherwise, we can proceed.

But even if those counts are satisfied, the order of the wind directions might not allow the boat to collect all required steps early enough. For example, if the required E steps are all towards the end of the wind sequence, then the earliest possible time is when the last required step is taken, and all other required steps (for other directions) are taken before or at that time.

So the problem reduces to: find the earliest time step where, in the first k steps (1-based?), the number of E's (if dx>0) or W's (if dx<0) is at least the required amount, and similarly for N/S for dy. Then, the answer is the maximum of the earliest positions where each required direction is met.

Wait, that's an interesting observation. Let's see.

Let me think of the required steps as:

For dx:

if dx > 0: required_e = dx, required_w = 0

if dx < 0: required_e = 0, required_w = -dx

else: required_e and required_w are 0.

Similarly for dy:

if dy >0: required_n = dy, required_s = 0

else if dy <0: required_s = -dy, required_n = 0

else: required_n and required_s are 0.

So for each direction, we need to have at least required_e E's, required_w W's, required_n N's, required_s S's in the first k steps.

But in the wind sequence, we need to find the earliest k where:

count_E (up to k) >= required_e

count_W (up to k) >= required_w

count_N (up to k) >= required_n

count_S (up to k) >= required_s

But the earliest possible k is the maximum of the earliest positions where each of these required counts are met.

For example, required_e steps may be met at step 100, required_w steps met at step 200. So the earliest k is 200.

But the boat can only reach the destination after all required steps have been taken. So the earliest time is the maximum of the earliest positions where each required count is met.

So the problem can be transformed into:

Compute the earliest positions where each required count is achieved (for E, W, N, S), and the answer is the maximum of these positions. If any required count is not achieved (i.e., there are not enough of that direction in the entire wind string), then output is -1.

This seems like a feasible approach.

So the steps are:

1. Compute dx and dy.

2. Determine required_e, required_w, required_n, required_s.

3. Check if the counts of E, W, N, S in the entire wind string meet the required amounts. If any required is not met, output -1.

4. Otherwise, for each direction (E, W, N, S), compute the earliest index (1-based? Or 0-based?) where the cumulative count reaches the required amount.

5. The answer is the maximum of these earliest indices, and then add 1 (since the steps are 0-based in the string, but the time is 1-based). Wait, the wind string is 0-based (since given as the second line, each character is the wind at the i-th second (assuming i starts at 0)).

Wait, the problem statement says: "the i-th character is the wind blowing direction at the i-th second". So each step is 0-based, from 0 to t-1. The earliest time is the number of seconds taken, which is (k+1) if step k is the last step taken. Because after step 0 (0-based), it's the first second.

Wait, for example, in the first sample input:

5 0 0 1 1

Wind string is SESNW (length 5).

The output is 4. So steps 0 to 3 (inclusive) are considered. The time taken is 4 seconds.

So the time is the index (0-based) plus 1. Because in step 0 (first second), step 1 (second second), etc. So for the k-th step (0-based), the time is k+1.

So the approach is:

For each required direction (E, W, N, S), find the earliest step (0-based) where the cumulative count of that direction up to and including that step is >= required. For example, if required_e is 2, find the earliest index where the cumulative E's up to that index is 2. Then, take the maximum of all these indexes for each required direction, and the answer is that maximum index +1. If all required directions are met by that maximum index, then that's the earliest possible time.

So how to compute the earliest indexes for each direction?

We can precompute for each direction, a list that tracks the positions where that direction occurs. Then, for a required count of, say, e, the earliest index is the (e-1)th occurrence of E (since the first occurrence is index 0, second is index 1, etc. Wait no, if we need 2 E's, the earliest index is the position of the second E (assuming zero-based). Wait, no. Let's say required_e is 2. We need to find the earliest step where the cumulative E's is at least 2. So, for example, if the first E is at index 3, the second at index 5, then the earliest index where E's count is 2 is 5. So for the required_e steps, the earliest index is the (required_e-1)th occurrence in the list of E's positions.

Similarly for the other directions.

So the steps would be:

- For each direction (E, W, N, S), collect a list of indices where that direction occurs.

- For required_e, if required_e > 0, check if the length of E's list is >= required_e. If not, return -1. Else, the earliest index for E is E_list[required_e-1].

- Do the same for W, N, S.

- Then, the answer is the maximum of all these indices (for each required direction) plus 1 (to convert from 0-based index to time).

If any of the required directions has no requirement (like required_e is zero), then their earliest index is not considered. For example, if required_e is zero, we don't need any E steps. So their earliest index is 0 (or not considered in the maximum? Wait, no. The maximum is taken over all required directions. For those directions with required count zero, their required steps are zero, so their earliest index is -infinity (or not included). But how to handle that?

Wait, the required_e is zero. So, for example, if dx is zero, then required_e and required_w are zero. So the earliest index for E is not needed. So in the maximum, we need to only consider the directions that have a required count greater than zero.

So in code:

We can collect all the earliest indices for the directions that have a required count > 0, then take the maximum of those indices. That maximum is the earliest possible step where all required steps are satisfied. Then, the answer is max_index + 1.

So for example, in the first sample input:

dx = 1-0 = 1. So required_e = 1. The E's in the wind string are at indices 0 and 3 (since the wind is S, E, S, N, W). Wait the wind string is 'SESNW'. Let's index them as 0: S, 1: E, 2: S, 3: N, 4: W.

So E occurs once, at index 1.

So required_e is 1. So the earliest index for E is 1.

dy is 1-0 =1. So required_n is 1. The N occurs once, at index 3.

So required_n's earliest index is 3.

The maximum of 1 and 3 is 3. So the answer is 3+1=4. Which matches the sample.

So this approach works.

Another example: the second sample input. Let's see.

Input is 10 5 3 3 6. So dx is 3-5 = -2. So required_w = 2.

dy is 6-3=3, required_n =3.

The wind string is NENSWESNEE.

Let's parse each direction:

Indices 0-9 (since t=10):

0: N

1: E

2: N

3: S

4: W

5: E

6: S

7: N

8: E

9: E

So required directions are W (2) and N (3).

Looking for W's in the wind. The W is at index 4. So there's only one W. So required_w=2, but there's only 1 W. So this would return -1. Which matches the sample.

So the plan is:

Compute dx and dy.

Calculate required_e, required_w, required_n, required_s.

Check if each required count is available in the wind string. For example, for required_e, check if the number of E's in the wind is >= required_e. Similarly for others.

If any required count is not met, output -1.

Else, for each direction that has a required count >0, collect the (required count)th occurrence's index (i.e., the index of the occurrence that brings the cumulative count to exactly the required count). The earliest index for that direction is that occurrence's index.

Take the maximum of all these indices. The answer is that maximum +1.

So the code steps:

Read t, sx, sy, ex, ey.

Compute dx = ex - sx, dy = ey - sy.

Compute required_e, required_w, required_n, required_s.

required_e = dx if dx >0 else 0

required_w = -dx if dx <0 else 0

required_n = dy if dy>0 else 0

required_s = -dy if dy <0 else 0

Then, count the number of E's, W's, N's, S's in the wind string.

If (required_e > count_E) or (required_w > count_W) or (required_n > count_N) or (required_s > count_S), then output -1.

Else, for each direction that has required steps >0, collect the index of the (required-1)th occurrence.

For example, for E: the required_e steps are needed. So collect the (required_e-1)th occurrence's index.

So for each direction, we can precompute a list of indices where that direction occurs. Then, for required steps, take the (required-1)th element of that list.

Once all required directions' indices are found, take the maximum among them. That's the earliest possible step where all required steps are met. The answer is max_index +1.

So the code can be structured as follows:

Read t, sx, sy, ex, ey.

wind = input().strip()

Compute dx = ex - sx

dy = ey - sy

required_e = dx if dx >0 else 0

required_w = -dx if dx <0 else 0

required_n = dy if dy>0 else 0

required_s = -dy if dy<0 else 0

Now, collect the counts and positions:

e_positions = []

w_positions = []

n_positions = []

s_positions = []

for idx, c in enumerate(wind):

    if c == 'E':

        e_positions.append(idx)

    elif c == 'W':

        w_positions.append(idx)

    elif c == 'N':

        n_positions.append(idx)

    elif c == 'S':

        s_positions.append(idx)

Then check:

if (required_e > len(e_positions)) or (required_w > len(w_positions)) or (required_n > len(n_positions)) or (required_s > len(s_positions)):

    print(-1)

else:

    # collect the required indices

    max_step = 0

    if required_e >0:

        max_step = max(max_step, e_positions[required_e-1])

    if required_w >0:

        max_step = max(max_step, w_positions[required_w-1])

    if required_n >0:

        max_step = max(max_step, n_positions[required_n-1])

    if required_s >0:

        max_step = max(max_step, s_positions[required_s-1])

    print(max_step +1)

That's the code.

Second sample:

t=10, sx=5, sy=3, ex=3, ey=6.

dx=3-5= -2 → required_w=2.

dy=6-3=3 → required_n=3.

Wind string: NENSWESNEE → let's list each character:

0: N

1: E

2: N

3: S

4: W

5: E

6: S

7: N

8: E

9: E

So W occurs at index 4. So w_positions is [4]. required_w is 2, but len(w_positions) is 1. So check fails. Output -1. Correct.

Another test case: suppose required_e=3, and e_positions has indexes [0,2,5]. Then required_e-1=2, e_positions[2] is 5. So that's the earliest index for E.

So the code should handle that.

What about when multiple directions are needed, and their required steps are met at different positions. For example, required_e=2 (positions 0 and 3), required_n=1 (position 2). The earliest indices are 3 and 2. Max is 3. Time is 4.

Yes.

So this approach works.

Now, considering the constraints. t can be up to 1e5, and for each character, we process it once. So O(t) time, which is acceptable for 1e5.

The memory usage is O(t) in the worst case (if all directions are the same). But for t up to 1e5, that's 4 lists each of up to 1e5 elements. That's 4*1e5 = 4e5 elements, which is acceptable for Python. But maybe there's a way to optimize memory?

Alternatively, during the processing of the wind string, we can track the cumulative counts for each direction, and for each direction, keep a list of the indices where the cumulative count reaches a certain value.

But the current approach is straightforward and manageable.

Thus, this code should work correctly and efficiently.
