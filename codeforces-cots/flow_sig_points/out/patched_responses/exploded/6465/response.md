Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the number of permutations of the digits of n that form a number divisible by m, without leading zeros. And n can be up to 1e18, which means the digits can be up to 18 digits long. Hmm, the constraints on m are up to 100, which is manageable. 

First, I need to generate all unique permutations of the digits of n. But wait, generating all permutations directly isn't feasible because 18 digits would have 18! possible permutations, which is way too big. So we need a smarter approach here.

So the problem is similar to counting the number of digit permutations that form a number divisible by m, avoiding leading zeros and duplicates. So how to approach this?

The key here is dynamic programming with memoization. Let's think about using a DP state that keeps track of the current remainder modulo m and which digits have been used so far. But since the digits can repeat, we need to account for duplicates to avoid overcounting. 

Wait, but even with DP, the mask for 18 digits would be 2^18 states, which is 262k, and for each mask, we track the remainder modulo m. So the DP state would be dp[mask][rem], which counts the number of ways to reach remainder rem using the digits in mask. The maximum mask is 2^18 = 262k, and m is up to 100. So total states are 262k * 100 = around 26 million. That's manageable, but maybe even better optimizations are possible.

But wait, the digits can have duplicates. For example, if there are multiple 3s, swapping them doesn't create a new permutation. So we need to adjust the DP to account for duplicate digits. How? By dividing the count by the factorial of the number of occurrences of each digit. Because permutations that swap identical digits are considered the same.

So the plan is:

1. Count the frequency of each digit in n.
2. Use DP to track the number of ways to reach each remainder modulo m using a subset of digits (without leading zeros), considering the digits' frequencies.
3. For each possible permutation (mask) that uses all digits, check if the remainder is 0, and sum those counts, adjusted by the factorial of duplicates.

Wait, but leading zeros are a problem. So the first digit cannot be zero. So during the DP, we have to ensure that the first digit is not zero. So how to handle that?

Hmm. So when building the permutations, the first digit is part of the selection. So in the DP, we need to track whether the first digit is zero. Wait, no. Because the problem states that the number cannot have leading zeros, which means that the first digit (most significant digit) must be non-zero. So when building the permutations, the first digit in the permutation must not be zero.

So in the DP, whenever we select the first digit (i.e., when the mask is empty and we are choosing the first digit), we can't choose zero. Then, for the subsequent digits, we can choose any digit, including zero, but the leading digit is already non-zero.

So the approach would be:

- Generate all permutations, considering that the first digit is non-zero.
- Use dynamic programming to track for each mask (digit positions used) and remainder mod m, the count of ways.
- But since the digits can have duplicates, the mask approach might not directly work because the same digits in different positions are considered the same permutation. So, perhaps we need to model the DP not based on positions but based on the count of each digit remaining.

Ah, right. So the problem is that the mask approach (tracking which positions are used) is not efficient when there are duplicate digits because different masks that use the same digits in different order but are duplicates would be treated as different in the mask approach. But in reality, they are the same. So we need a different way to model the state.

So instead of using a mask to track which digits are used, we can track the count of each digit remaining. But that might be complex. Alternatively, we can model the state as the current remainder mod m and the count of each digit used. But for digits 0-9, each with up to 18 occurrences, the state space would be m * (frequency_0 +1) * (frequency_1 +1) ... * (frequency_9 +1). Which could be manageable if the frequencies are not too high.

Wait, but for digits 0-9, each with up to 18 occurrences. For example, if all digits are the same (like n=111...1), then the frequency of 1 is 18, and others are zero. Then the state for that digit is 18+1=19 possibilities. But if multiple digits are present, the product of their (count+1) could be very large. For example, if there are 18 different digits, each with a count of 1, then the product is 2^18 = 262k. But multiplied by m=100, that's 26 million, which is manageable.

But for a problem where the digits can repeat a lot, like n=999999999999999999, the frequency for 9 is 18, and the state for that digit is 19 possibilities. So the total state space would be m (100) * 19 (for 9) and others (since they are zero) -> 1900 states. Which is manageable.

So the key idea is to model the DP state as the current remainder mod m, and the count of each digit remaining. Then, for each state, we can choose any available digit (with count >0), and transition to a new state where that digit's count is decreased by 1, and the new remainder is (current_remainder * 10 + digit) mod m.

Additionally, the first digit chosen must not be zero. So when we start building the number, the first step must choose a non-zero digit.

So the steps are:

1. Convert the input number n into a list of its digits.
2. Count the frequency of each digit (0-9).
3. Use DP with memoization where the state is:
   - The current remainder mod m.
   - The counts of each remaining digit (represented as a tuple of counts for 0-9, but perhaps optimized by only tracking non-zero counts).
4. The transitions are: for each possible digit that has a remaining count, subtract one from its count, compute the new remainder (current_remainder * 10 + digit) mod m, and add to the next state.
5. The initial state is when no digits have been used (all counts are as per the input), and the remainder is 0. Wait, no. Wait, when building the number digit by digit, each step appends the next digit. So the initial state would be when no digits have been chosen. The remainder is 0. Then, when the first digit is chosen (non-zero), the remainder becomes (digit) mod m. Then, for each subsequent digit, the remainder becomes (current_remainder * 10 + new_digit) mod m.

So the DP state needs to track the remainder after each step. The transitions are based on the digits left and the current remainder.

But how to handle the first digit (non-zero) requirement?

When building the number, the first digit is the first one added. So during the DP transitions, the first time we add a digit, it must not be zero. So the DP needs to track whether the number has started (i.e., whether digits have been chosen before). If not, then the next digit chosen must be non-zero. Once the first digit is chosen (non-zero), the rest can be any.

Wait, but in the DP state, how to represent whether the number has started or not. Because, for example, if the mask is empty (no digits chosen), then the next digit must be non-zero. Once a digit is chosen, then the rest can be zero.

So the DP state would also include a flag indicating whether the number has started. But adding this flag to the state would double the state space. But given that m is up to 100, and the other state parameters, perhaps it's manageable.

Alternatively, we can handle the first step as a separate case. Let me think: the total number of permutations is the sum over all possible first digits (non-zero) multiplied by the permutations of the remaining digits. But perhaps integrating this into the DP is easier.

So the state would consist of:

- remainder: the current remainder mod m.
- counts: the remaining counts of each digit.
- started: a boolean indicating whether the number has started (i.e., at least one digit has been chosen).

Wait, but when the number hasn't started (started=False), the next digit must be non-zero. Once started=True, any digit (including zero) can be chosen.

But this would add a binary flag to the state. So for each state, we have 2 possibilities for 'started'. But given the other parameters, maybe it's manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'started' can be inferred from the counts. If all digits are zero, then the number is zero, which is allowed if n is zero. But the problem states that n >=1. So n can't be zero, but digits can include leading zeros only if the entire permutation is zero, but that's not possible since n is >=1. Wait, the problem says n is at least 1, so leading zeros are not allowed. So the first digit must be non-zero.

So in the DP, the first digit chosen must be non-zero. So during the transition from the initial state (no digits chosen), the next digit must be non-zero. Once a digit is chosen, the rest can be anything.

So the state can be represented as:

- remainder: current mod m.
- counts: remaining digits.
- started: whether any digits have been chosen (so, started=True means that the first digit was chosen, so leading zeros are allowed for subsequent digits). Wait, no. The started can be a flag that indicates that the first digit has been chosen, so subsequent digits can be anything. So for the first step, started is False, and the next digit must be non-zero. Once started is True, any digit can be chosen.

Wait, no. Once the first digit is chosen (started=True), then the rest can be zero. So the started flag is necessary to track whether the first digit has been chosen. So the state parameters are:

- remainder
- counts of remaining digits
- started (whether the first digit has been chosen)

Wait, but the started flag is a boolean. So the DP state is (remainder, counts, started). But how to represent the counts? Since the counts are for each digit 0-9, but perhaps we can represent them as a tuple of counts for each digit. However, that's 10 numbers. For example, if the original counts are [a0, a1, ..., a9], then after using a digit d, the counts would have a0, ..., ad-1, ..., a9.

But this may be manageable. Let's think: for each digit in 0-9, the count can be up to 18. So for each digit, 18 possibilities. But 10 digits would make the total possible count tuples 18^10, which is way too big. That's impossible. So this approach is not feasible.

Hmm, so the problem is that the counts can't be represented as a tuple for 10 digits each with up to 18 possibilities. That's way too many states.

So we need another way to model the state. Let's think again.

Alternative approach: Instead of tracking the counts for each digit, track the multiset of remaining digits. But how? That's not obvious.

Wait, but the key idea is to use the frequency counts and memoize based on that, but perhaps using memoization that groups permutations that use the same digits (regardless of order). But how?

Wait, perhaps the mask approach can be modified to account for the digits used so far, but considering that different masks that use the same digits (even in different orders) are considered the same state. But that's not possible because the mask is a bitmask of positions. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be modeled by considering the current remainder and the counts of each digit remaining. But again, the state is the counts of each digit, which is 10 numbers, each up to their original counts. So for example, if the original counts are for 0: 3, 1:2, etc., then the state for counts is (3,2,...). But even with that, the state space is too large for 18 digits.

So perhaps the solution is to use memoization with memoization parameters that include the current remainder, the counts of each digit, and the 'started' flag. But even then, with 10 digits each up to 18, the state space could be way too big.

Wait, but let's calculate. Let's say the total number of possible count tuples is the product of (count_digit + 1) for each digit. Because for each digit, the count can be 0 to original count. For example, if original count of digit 0 is 3, then possible values for that digit's count are 0,1,2,3. So (3+1) possibilities. So the product across all digits would be (c0+1) * (c1+1) * ... * (c9+1). What's the maximum possible value of this product?

If all digits are unique (each digit appears once), then there are 18 digits (since n can be up to 1e18, which is 18 digits). So the product would be 2^18 = 262,144. But if some digits are repeated, the product will be lower. For example, if all digits are the same (like 999999999999999999), then the product is (18+1) = 19 for that digit, and 1 for others (since their counts are zero). So 19. But in general, the product is manageable if there are many repeated digits.

But for 18 digits, in the worst case (all distinct), 2^18 is 262k. Multiply that by m (100) and the started flag (2) gives 262k * 100 * 2 = around 52 million states. But maybe even that is manageable with memoization and dynamic programming.

But 52 million is a lot. How can we optimize this?

Hmm, maybe we can memoize the DP states using a dictionary with tuples as keys. But dictionaries are slow for that. Alternatively, use a memoization table with arrays. But even so, 52 million is a lot.

Alternatively, we can represent the counts in a way that reduces the state. For example, the order of the digits doesn't matter. So, for the counts, the order in which digits are used doesn't affect the state. So, the DP state depends on the remaining digits (counts) and the current remainder. 

So perhaps the DP can be implemented as follows:

The state is:

- remainder: current remainder mod m.
- mask: a representation of the counts of each digit. But how?

Alternatively, for each digit, track how many times it's been used. Then, the state is (remainder, used_counts), where used_counts is a tuple indicating how many times each digit has been used. But this seems similar to the previous approach.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as building the number digit by digit. Each digit added affects the remainder (new_remainder = (current_remainder * 10 + new_digit) mod m). The choice of the next digit is from the remaining digits (considering duplicates). But to avoid overcounting, we need to group identical digits.

So, when there are k identical digits left, choosing any of them leads to the same state. So, for example, if we have three 5s left and we choose one, then the next state will have two 5s left, regardless of which 5 we chose. So, the transitions can be handled by considering the count of each digit.

So the approach is to model the state as:

- The current remainder mod m.
- The count of each remaining digit (as a tuple of counts, e.g., counts[0] is the number of 0s left, etc.).
- A flag indicating whether the number has started (i.e., whether at least one digit has been chosen). This is necessary to enforce the leading zero rule.

The transitions would be as follows:

For each possible digit d in 0-9:

- If counts[d] == 0, skip.
- If the number hasn't started (started=False), then d must be non-zero. So, when started is False, d must be >=1.
- Then, subtract 1 from counts[d], compute the new_remainder based on the current remainder and whether the number has started.
   - If not started, then the first digit contributes to the remainder as d mod m.
   - If started, then the new_remainder is (current_remainder * 10 + d) mod m.
- The new started flag is True if either it was already True or we have now added a digit (d in this case). So, once started becomes True, it remains True.

Wait, but when we add a digit, whether it's the first or not, the started flag transitions to True. So, the next state's started flag is always True after the first digit is added. So, the started flag can be a boolean: if False, then the next digit must be non-zero. Once a digit is added, the started becomes True, and subsequent steps can add any digit (including zero) as the first digit is already non-zero.

So the DP state is (remainder, counts, started), where counts is a tuple of counts for each digit. The transitions would be:

If started is False:

   For each digit d in 1-9 (since leading zero is not allowed) where counts[d] > 0:

      new_counts = list(counts)
      new_counts[d] -= 1
      new_remainder = d % m
      new_started = True
      add to DP(new_remainder, tuple(new_counts), new_started) the number of ways from the current state multiplied by the count of d's available (but wait, how does the count affect the transitions?)

Wait, here's the problem: when you have multiple copies of the same digit, choosing any of them leads to the same state. So, for example, if there are 3 5s left, and you choose one, the next state's count for 5 is 2, regardless of which 5 was chosen. So, for transitions, each possible digit (with count >0) can be considered, but we must multiply by the number of available digits (since choosing any of them leads to the same state). 

But wait, no. Because if there are multiple digits, the order in which you choose them doesn't matter. So, for example, if the remaining digits are two 3s and one 5, and you choose a 3, then the next state's count is one 3 and one 5. But choosing any of the two 3s would count as two different permutations. However, in the DP approach, which groups permutations with the same counts, these two choices are considered the same. So the DP would account for all possible permutations by multiplying the number of available digits when adding to the next state.

Ah, right. So when we choose a digit d with count k, the number of ways to choose that digit is k (since there are k identical digits to choose from). So, in the DP transition, when we process a digit d with count k, we contribute k * dp[current_state] to the next state. But after choosing, the count for d becomes k-1, and the next transitions for d would have count k-1.

Wait, but this approach would account for the permutations correctly. Because for each possible digit choice (considering duplicates), the number of ways is multiplied by the available count. 

So, for example, if in the current state, there are 3 5s available, then choosing a 5 would contribute 3 times the current DP value to the next state (since any of the 3 5s can be chosen). Then, the count for 5 in the next state is 2, and choosing another 5 would contribute 2 times, etc.

This way, the DP counts the number of permutations, considering the multiplicities of the digits.

So, the DP transitions would work as follows:

Initialize the DP with (remainder=0, counts=original_counts, started=False). The value here is 1 (one way to have not chosen any digits).

For each state in the DP:

   if not started:

       for each d in 1..9:

           if counts[d] > 0:

               new_remainder = (0 * 10 + d) % m  # because started is False, the first digit's contribution is d, not multiplied by 10.

               new_counts = list(counts)

               new_counts[d] -= 1

               new_counts = tuple(new_counts)

               ways = counts[d]  # because there are counts[d] choices of d to pick

               add to the new state (new_remainder, new_counts, started=True) the value (current_state_value * ways)

   else:

       for each d in 0..9:

           if counts[d] > 0:

               new_remainder = (current_remainder * 10 + d) % m

               new_counts = list(counts)

               new_counts[d] -= 1

               new_counts = tuple(new_counts)

               ways = counts[d]

               add to the new state (new_remainder, new_counts, started=True) the value (current_state_value * ways)

But wait, when started is False, the current_remainder is 0. So for the first digit, the new_remainder is (0 * 10 + d) mod m = d mod m. But in the code, when started is False, the current_remainder is 0. So that part is correct.

So the DP transitions for the first digit (started=False) are handled by considering all non-zero digits. Then, for each possible digit, the new remainder is computed as d mod m, and the count of d is reduced by 1. The number of ways is multiplied by the count of available d's.

For the other steps (started=True), the transitions are similar, but the remainder is computed as (current_remainder * 10 + d) mod m, and digits can be zero.

The DP is built using memoization, possibly using a dictionary to represent the current states and their counts.

But how to implement this efficiently?

The key is to represent the counts as a tuple (since lists are not hashable), and to memoize the states using a dictionary for each step. Alternatively, we can represent the state as a combination of remainder, counts, and started, and use a memoization table (like a dictionary) to track the number of ways to reach that state.

So the steps in code would be:

1. Read the input n and m.

2. Convert n to a string and count the frequency of each digit. For example, n='104' would have counts of {'1':1, '0':1, '4':1}.

3. Convert the counts into a tuple of counts for digits 0-9. For example, the above would be counts = (1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0). Wait, digits 0-9, so counts[0] is the count of '0's, counts[1] is count of '1's, etc.

4. Initialize a DP dictionary. The initial state is (remainder=0, counts=original_counts, started=False) with a value of 1. Because before any digits are chosen, there's one way to be in that state.

5. Iterate over all possible states, and process each state by generating new states through transitions. However, handling this with a BFS-like approach where we process states level by level (based on the number of digits used) might be more efficient, but for code purposes, a memoization approach with a dictionary might be easier.

But since the order of processing matters (because transitions depend on the current state), perhaps using a queue to process states in order of the number of digits used. But for code purposes, perhaps a dictionary of states that we update as we go.

Alternatively, since each transition uses one digit, we can process the DP in a BFS-like manner, grouping states by the number of digits used. This could be efficient.

So here's the plan:

- Create a list of possible states for each step. For example, after 0 digits used (initial state), 1 digit used, etc., up to all digits used.

- For each step, for each state, process transitions by choosing a next digit.

But even this might be challenging. Let's think of using a dictionary to track the current DP states and their counts.

The code can be structured as follows:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
from collections import defaultdict


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, m = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()
    m = int(m)

        freq[int(d)] += 1
    # We need to track the DP states: (remainder, counts, started)
    # We can represent counts as a tuple of frequencies for 0-9.
    counts = tuple(freq)
    # Initialize the DP.

    print(result, file=output_stream)

But what about the second sample:

Digits are 2,2,3. counts are [0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0].

len(digits) is 3.

Processing steps:

Initial state: (0, counts, False).

First iteration (first digit):

Choose d=2 or 3 (non-zero).

d=2:

new_remainder = 2 mod4=2. new counts: 2-1=1, 3 count remains 1. ways: 2 (since there are two 2s). So new_state (2, (0,0,1,1, ...), True) with ways 2.

d=3: new_remainder 3 mod4=3. ways:1. new_state (3, (0,0,2,0, ...), True) with ways 1.

available digits are 2 and 3.

For d=2:

new_remainder = (2*10 +2) mod4=22 mod4= 22 - 5*4=22-20=2 → remainder 2. new counts: (0,0,0,1, ...). ways added: 2 *1 (since current_ways is 2, and count of 2 is 1). So new_state (2, (0,0,0,1, ...), True) with ways 2*1=2.

For d=3:

new_remainder = (2*10+3)=23 mod4=23-5*4=23-20=3 →3 mod4=3. ways added 2*1=2. So new_state (3, (0,0,1,0, ...), True) with ways 2.

For state (3, counts (0,0,2,0, ...), started=True):

available digits are 2 and 2.

For d=2:

new_remainder = (3*10 +2) mod4=32 mod4= 0. new counts: (0,0,1,0, ...). ways added:1 *2 (current_ways is1, count of 2 is2) → new_state (0, (0,0,1,0, ...), True) with ways 2.

Third iteration (third digit):

Process all states after second iteration.

For example, the state (2, (0,0,0,1, ...), True) → available digit is 3.

new_remainder = 2*10 +3=23 mod4=3. So state (3, all zeros, True) → no contribution.

State (3, (0,0,1,0, ...), True): available digits are 2.

Processing d=2: new_remainder = 3*10 +2=32 mod4=0. new counts all zero. So adds ways 2 (current_ways is 2, count of 2 is1. So 2*1=2. But this state's remainder is 0 → contributes 2 ways.

State (0, (0,0,1,0, ...), True) → available digit is 2. new_remainder = (0*10 +2) mod4=2. So not zero.

So after third iteration, the states that contribute to the answer are:

state (0, all zeros, True) from the third iteration's processing of state (0, (0,0,1,0, ...), True) with ways 2? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think:

After third iteration, the states that have all zeros in counts are:

For example, the state (0, all zeros, True) with ways 2 (from the state (3, counts (0,0,2,0, ...)) → when d=2 is chosen, the new_remainder is 32 mod4=0, new counts are (0,0,1,0, ...) minus 1 → (0,0,0,0, ...). So the state (0, all zeros, True) has ways 2.

Another state could be the one from the state (0, (0,0,1,0, ...), True) → but after third digit (2), the remainder is (0*10 +2) mod4=2. So the state after is (2, all zeros, True), which doesn't contribute.

So in the third iteration, there is one state (0, all zeros, True) with 2 ways. But the sample output is 1. Wait, this suggests a problem with the code.

Hmm, the second sample input is 223, m=4. The correct output is 1. But according to the code's calculation, it's returning 2 ways, which is incorrect.

What's wrong here?

Wait, let's re-examine the problem. The number 223 can be rearranged into permutations. The valid permutations that are divisible by 4 are those where the last two digits form a number divisible by 4. Because 4 divides 100, so any number is congruent modulo 4 to its last two digits.

The permutations of 223 are 223, 232, 322, 223 (again), but since there are two 2s, the distinct permutations are:

223, 232, 322 → three permutations. The last two digits of each are 23, 32, 22. 23 mod4 is 3, 32 mod4 is 0, 22 mod4 is 2. So only 232 (last two digits 32) is divisible by 4. So the code's calculation is returning 1, but according to the code's steps, it's getting 2 ways. What's wrong?

Ah, wait, perhaps the code is overcounting due to duplicate digits.

Let's see the code's steps again. In the first iteration, when processing the initial state, for d=2, there are two 2s available. So the code multiplies the current ways (1) by the count of d (2), leading to new_state (2, counts (0,0,1,1, ...), True) with ways 2.

But the two 2s are identical. So when you choose one of them, the code counts this as two different ways (since there are two 2s), but in reality, they are the same permutation. So this leads to overcounting.

Ah, here's the problem! The code is counting permutations as distinct even when they are the same due to duplicate digits. So, for example, swapping the two 2s in the first step leads to the same permutation, but the code counts them as two different ways.

So the code's current approach is incorrect. It's overcounting permutations that have duplicate digits.

So this is a critical error in the code's logic.

The problem is that when multiple identical digits are present, the code multiplies by the count of the digit, which results in counting all permutations of the same digits as separate, but they should be considered the same.

For example, in the first step of the sample input 223, choosing the first 2 or the second 2 (they are identical) would lead to the same permutation. But the code's current approach treats them as two different ways, leading to overcounting.

This is a fundamental flaw in the approach. The code is designed to count the number of distinct permutations, but with duplicates, the current approach counts all possible orderings, including those that are the same due to identical digits.

So the code needs to be adjusted to account for duplicate digits by dividing by the factorial of the number of duplicates. 

But how?

The key issue is that the code's DP counts the number of permutations, including those that are the same due to duplicate digits. So, for example, if there are k copies of a digit, then the code's approach counts k * (k-1) * ... * 1 ways for arranging those digits, but the actual number of distinct permutations should be divided by k! for each duplicated digit.

So the correct approach is to compute the number of distinct permutations that satisfy the remainder condition, which is the total number of such permutations (including duplicates) divided by the product of the factorials of the frequencies of each digit.

Wait, but the code's current approach is counting all possible permutations (including those that are the same when digits are duplicated). For example, if the digits are 222, there's only one distinct permutation, but the code's approach would count 3! ways (3*2*1=6), which is wrong.

So the code's current logic is incorrect for cases with duplicate digits. So the approach needs to be adjusted to count the number of distinct permutations.

So how to modify the code?

The problem is that the current code's transitions multiply by the count of available digits, leading to overcounting. For example, in the first step for 223, choosing a 2 (count 2) gives two options, but these two options are the same permutation. So the code's approach counts them as two separate ways, leading to an overcount.

So the solution is to avoid multiplying by the count of the digit. Instead, choose the digit once, but divide the total permutations by the product of the factorials of the frequency of each digit.

For example, the code's current approach counts all permutations (including those that are duplicates), and then at the end, we divide by the product of the factorials of the frequency of each digit to get the number of distinct permutations.

But how to integrate this into the DP.

Alternative approach:

The code's DP currently tracks the number of permutations (including duplicates), but the required answer is the number of distinct permutations. So the answer is (total permutations counted by DP) / (product of (frequency[d]!) for all d).

But this is only true if the DP counts all permutations, including those that are the same due to duplicate digits.

For example, if the digits are 223, the DP would count all 3! permutations (6) divided by 2! (since there are two 2s) and 1! for the 3. So 6/(2*1) = 3 distinct permutations.

But in the code's current approach, the DP counts the permutations as 2*1*1 = 2 for the case where the first two digits are 2 and 2. But this is incorrect.

So the code's current approach is incorrect, and the correct solution is to count all permutations (including duplicates) and then divide by the product of the factorials of the original frequencies.

Wait, but how to do that.

For example, the total number of distinct permutations of the digits is (total_digits! ) / product (freq[d]! )

So the code's current approach computes the number of such permutations (including duplicates) that satisfy the remainder condition. Then, we need to divide by the product of freq[d]! to get the distinct count.

But the code's DP counts the number of permutations as if all digits are distinct. For example, if there are two 2s, the code counts them as two separate permutations for the first 2, then another one for the second 2. But the actual distinct permutations is the code's count divided by 2! for the 2s.

So, the approach would be:

Compute the total number of permutations (including duplicates) that satisfy the conditions, then divide by the product of freq[d]! for all d.

But how to compute this.

Wait, the code's DP currently counts the number of permutations as if all digits are unique. For example, for digits 223, the code's transitions would allow choosing any of the 2s, leading to overcounting.

But when there are duplicate digits, the code's count is the number of permutations of the digits (including duplicates), which is equal to the actual number of distinct permutations multiplied by the product of freq[d]! for each digit d.

So, to get the correct answer, the code's DP result must be divided by the product of the factorials of the frequencies of each digit.

So the final answer is (code's result) / (product of freq[d]! for all d).

Yes! Because the code's current approach counts all possible orderings of the digits, even those that are the same due to duplicates. For example, when there are two 2s, the code counts each of the 2! ways to arrange them as separate permutations, but they are actually the same. So the code's count is (number of distinct permutations) × product (freq[d]!).

So dividing by the product of the factorials of the original frequencies will give the correct count of distinct permutations.

So this means that the code needs to compute the total ways as per the DP, then divide by the product of the factorials of each digit's frequency in the original input.

So the code must calculate this division.

But how to handle this in Python, especially since the division must be exact.

So the steps are:

1. Compute the product of the factorials of the original frequencies.

For example, in the first sample input (104), the frequencies are 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, ... So product is 1! * 1! *1! = 1.

So dividing by 1 has no effect.

In the second sample input (223), the frequencies are 2 (for digit 2) and 1 (for digit 3). So product is 2! * 1! = 2. So the code's DP count is divided by 2.

In the second sample's code steps, the code's DP returns 2 ways (as in the earlier analysis), but the correct answer is 1. So 2 / 2 = 1.

Yes! So this adjustment is needed.

So the code must be modified to:

- Compute the product of the factorials of the original frequencies.

- Compute the DP result as the sum of all valid states (all digits used, remainder 0).

- Divide the DP result by the product of the factorials.

But how to do this division correctly, given that the numbers can be large, but the division must be exact.

The code can precompute the factorial product and then divide the DP result by it.

But to compute the product, we can calculate the factorial of each frequency and multiply them together.

But how to compute this product in Python.

For example:

original_freq = [count of 0, count of 1, ..., count of 9]

product = 1

for d in range(10):

    product *= factorial(original_freq[d])

Then, the answer is (dp_result) // product.

But since the DP result must be divisible by product (because the code counts all permutations, including duplicates, which is product times the distinct permutations count), this division is exact.

So the code must compute this.

So the code needs to:

- Compute the product of the factorials of the original frequencies.

- Compute the DP result as before.

- Divide the DP result by the product to get the correct answer.

So adding this to the code.

Now, the code:

Another example: third sample input 7067678 8 → output 47.

But without knowing the frequencies, we can't check, but the code should handle it correctly.

Thus, the code's updated approach is correct. The key was to multiply by the available count in the transitions (counting all permutations, including duplicates), then divide by the product of the factorials of the original frequencies to get the distinct count.

So the final code should include this division.
