<think>
Okay, let's see. We have this problem where we need to calculate the sum of values over all possible good paths after each update. The constraints are n and k up to 5000, and q up to 2e5. Oh right, and after each update, we have to output the new sum. So the straightforward approach of recomputing everything for each query is definitely not going to work because 2e5 queries multiplied by O(nk) per query would be way too slow.

Hmm. Let's think about how to model the problem. Each good path is a sequence of k+1 cells (starting position plus k moves) where each consecutive cell is adjacent. But since the robot can move left or right, the number of possible paths could be very large. But the sum over all paths is what's needed. So, for each cell, and each step in the path, how much does a_i contribute to the total sum?

Wait, maybe we can model this as each cell's contribution multiplied by how many times it's visited in all possible paths. Because the total sum is the sum of a_i multiplied by the number of times cell i appears in any path.

Yes! So the key is to precompute for each cell i, the number of times it appears in all possible paths. Then, the total sum is the sum of (a_i * cnt[i]) modulo 1e9+7. Then, for each query, we just need to update a single a_i and recalculate the sum based on the precomputed cnt array.

So the problem reduces to two parts: precompute the cnt array, which is the coefficient for each a_i, and then handle updates efficiently by knowing these coefficients.

Now the challenge is to compute the cnt array efficiently. Let's think about how to calculate cnt[i] for each i.

The cnt[i] is the total number of times cell i is visited in all possible paths. Each path starts at some position (from 1 to n), makes exactly k moves (so k+1 steps), and doesn't go out of bounds. For each position j (starting cell), and each step t (from 0 to k), if the path's t-th step is at cell i, then it contributes 1 to cnt[i].

But considering all possible paths, how many times is cell i visited at step t for a starting position j?

Wait, maybe dynamic programming can help here. Let's define dp[t][i] as the number of paths that are at cell i after t moves, summed over all possible starting positions. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let's see.

Alternatively, for each step t (from 0 to k), and for each cell i, compute the number of times i is visited at step t across all possible starting positions and all possible paths that start there and make exactly k moves.

Wait, but the starting position is part of the path. So, the total cnt[i] is the sum over all possible starting positions s, and all possible paths of length k starting at s, and all steps t (0 <= t <=k) of the occurrence of i in the path.

But that's complicated. Let's think differently. For a given starting cell s, the number of paths that start at s and make exactly k moves is 2^k minus those paths that go out of bounds. Wait, but this seems tricky. Because the robot can't go out of bounds, so each move must be valid.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the number of times a cell i is visited at step m in all paths. Then, for each m (from 0 to k), the number of paths that have s as the starting cell, and after m steps are at i, multiplied by the number of possible ways to complete the remaining steps (but wait, no, the total number of steps must be exactly k, so the path is determined by the k moves. So the entire path is of length k steps. So the steps from 0 to k are all part of the path. So for each step t (0<=t<=k), the cell at step t is part of the path. So, for each starting cell s, we can compute the number of paths that start at s and have cell i at step t, for each t. Then, summing over all s and t gives cnt[i].

So the approach is to compute, for each starting cell s, and for each t in 0..k, the number of paths starting at s of exactly k moves, such that at step t, the path is at cell i. Wait, no. Wait, the path starts at s (t=0), then each move is a step. So a path is a sequence of cells s = c_0, c_1, ..., c_k. The sum for the path is the sum of a_{c_0} + a_{c_1} + ... + a_{c_k}. The total sum over all paths is the sum over all paths of their sum. Which can be rewritten as sum_{i=1 to n} a_i * (number of times i appears in all paths' steps 0 to k).

So the cnt[i] is exactly the total number of times cell i is visited in all possible paths (summing over all steps and all paths).

Thus, to compute cnt[i], we need to calculate for each possible starting cell s, and for each possible path starting at s and making exactly k moves, the count of how many times i appears in their steps (from 0 to k). Then sum all these counts.

This seems manageable via dynamic programming.

Let's model for each s, the number of times cell i appears in the steps of paths starting at s. Let's call this cnt_s[i]. Then, the total cnt[i] is the sum over all s of cnt_s[i].

So how to compute cnt_s[i] for each s?

For a starting cell s, the path consists of k moves. The steps are t=0 (s), t=1 (after first move), ..., t=k (after k moves). The path must not go out of bounds at any step.

For each step t in 0..k, the number of paths starting at s that are at cell i at step t. Then, cnt_s[i] is the sum over t=0 to k of the number of such paths multiplied by 1 (since each occurrence in the path contributes 1 to the sum).

But how to compute this?

Wait, the number of paths that start at s and after exactly m moves (for m from 0 to k) are at i. But for each m, the paths that reach i at step m can be part of the total paths. Because the path must not go out of bounds at any step. So, the paths are allowed to stay within 1 to n for all steps.

So, for each s, we can model a DP that tracks for each cell j and step m (number of moves made), the number of ways to be at j after m moves. Then, for each s, the DP is initialized as dp[0][s] = 1, and other cells are 0. Then, for each step from 1 to k, we compute the transitions. However, since n and k are up to 5000, and s can be up to 5000, this would be O(n^2 * k) time, which is 5000^3 = 125e9 operations. That's way too slow.

Wait, that's not feasible. So we need a smarter approach.

Alternative idea: For each position j and step m, compute the number of paths that end at j after m moves, regardless of the starting position. Then, for each j and m, the contribution to cnt[j] would be the number of paths starting at any s and having j at step m. But how?

Wait, perhaps the DP can be precomputed in such a way that for each step m, the number of paths that reach cell i at step m, multiplied by the number of possible ways to have started in s and then reach i at m. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, think of the problem as follows: For each step m (from 0 to k), the number of times cell i is visited at step m across all possible paths. Let's denote this as f[i][m]. Then, the total cnt[i] is the sum over m=0 to k of f[i][m].

So how to compute f[i][m]?

Each path starts at some s. For step m, the number of paths that have their m-th step at i is equal to the number of starting positions s multiplied by the number of ways to reach i in m steps starting from s. But summing over all s.

Wait, but that's the same as, for each m, compute the sum over s of the number of paths starting at s that reach i in m steps, multiplied by the number of paths they have for the remaining steps (from m to k steps). Wait, because each path is exactly k moves. So the total path is made up of m steps to reach i, and then (k - m) steps that can be any valid moves as long as they don't go out of bounds.

Wait, no. Because once a path starts at s, makes m steps to i, then makes (k - m) steps. But for the path to be valid, all steps must not go out of bounds at any step. So even if during the first m steps the path stays within bounds, during the remaining steps it might go out. So the entire path must stay within bounds for all steps. Therefore, the approach of splitting into m steps and then (k - m) steps is not straightforward.

This complicates things. Because even if after m steps you reach i, the remaining steps could cause the path to go out of bounds, making the entire path invalid. So the total number of valid paths that reach i at step m is not simply the product of the number of ways to reach i in m steps multiplied by the number of ways to complete the remaining steps.

This suggests that the problem is not separable into steps, which makes it difficult to compute.

Alternative approach: For a starting cell s, the number of paths of exactly k steps (i.e., k moves) that start at s and do not go out of bounds at any step. For each such path, count how many times each cell is visited (i.e., the sum over all steps in the path). Then, sum over all starting cells s and all paths starting at s.

But how to model this efficiently?

Hmm. Let's model for each s, and for each m (0 <= m <=k), the number of paths starting at s that have exactly m steps, and are valid (i.e., do not go out of bounds) for those m steps. Then, for each s and m, track the current cell and the number of paths. But this seems to require O(nk) per s, which is O(n^2k) time again, which is not feasible.

Wait, but maybe for all starting cells s, we can compute a DP that handles all s simultaneously. Let's think about this.

We can model a DP where dp[m][j] represents the total number of paths (summed over all starting cells) that reach j after m steps, considering all possible starting cells and paths that have not gone out of bounds in any of the m steps. Then, for each step m, the sum over j of dp[m][j] multiplied by the number of ways to complete the remaining k - m steps. But this seems unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model for each cell j and step m, the number of paths that start at any s, reach j after m steps (without ever going out of bounds), and then can complete the remaining k - m steps without going out of bounds. Then, for each (j, m), the contribution to cnt[i] would be the number of such paths where i is in the first m steps plus the number where i is in the remaining steps. But this feels complicated.

Alternatively, think of the entire path as a sequence of k+1 cells (including the starting cell). The path must not go out of bounds at any step. For each such path, each cell in the sequence contributes to the count for that cell. The total sum is the sum over all such paths of the sum of a_i's in their cells. So the total sum is the sum of a_i multiplied by the number of times i appears in all paths.

So the problem is to compute for each i, the total number of occurrences across all valid paths of any length (from 0 to k steps) in the path.

But again, the challenge is to compute this efficiently.

Another idea: For each cell i, the coefficient cnt[i] can be computed as the sum over all possible positions in the path (from 0 to k steps) multiplied by the number of paths that pass through i at that position, summed over all possible starting positions.

So to compute this, we can model for each position t (0 <= t <=k), the number of times cell i is visited at position t in any valid path. Summing over t gives cnt[i].

The key is to compute for each t, the total number of paths (regardless of starting position) that have their t-th step at i, and the entire path is valid (all steps stay within the grid). Then, for each t, that count is multiplied by 1 (since each occurrence contributes once). The sum over all t is cnt[i].

But how to compute this for all t and all i?

Wait, perhaps for each t, the number of paths (starting at any s) that are at i after t steps, and have not gone out of bounds in any step up to t, multiplied by the number of valid paths from i for the remaining steps (from t to k steps). Because the path must have exactly k steps. So after t steps at i, there are (k - t) steps left. The number of ways to proceed from i for (k - t) steps without going out of bounds. Then, the total number of paths that pass through i at step t is (number of ways to reach i in t steps) * (number of ways to do the remaining k - t steps starting from i).

Wait, this seems promising. Let's formalize this.

For a given t (step in 0..k), the number of paths that have their t-th step at i and are valid for the entire k steps is equal to:

ways_to_reach_i_in_t_steps * ways_to_do_remaining_k_minus_t_steps_from_i.

Because the first t steps must form a valid path (starting from some s, making t steps to i), and the remaining (k - t) steps must form a valid path from i (making exactly k - t steps, no out of bounds).

But how to compute these two parts.

Let's denote:

- f[t][i]: the number of valid paths (starting from any s) that reach i after exactly t steps. (Here, a valid path is one that does not go out of bounds during the first t steps.)

- g[m][i]: the number of valid paths starting at i and making exactly m moves (m steps) without going out of bounds. Then, for the remaining (k - t) steps, we need g[k - t][i], which is the number of valid paths from i with exactly (k - t) moves.

Then, the total contribution for step t and cell i is f[t][i] * g[k - t][i]. Because for each path that reaches i in t steps, multiplied by the number of ways to complete the remaining (k - t) steps from i, the product is the number of full paths (of k steps) that pass through i at step t. And since each such path contributes 1 to the cnt[i] for step t, the total contribution is f[t][i] * g[k - t][i].

So, cnt[i] = sum_{t=0 to k} [f[t][i] * g[k - t][i} ].

So if we can precompute f and g for all t and i, then we can compute cnt[i] efficiently.

Now the problem reduces to computing f and g.

Let's start with f[t][i]. f[t][i] is the number of paths that start at any s, make t steps, end at i, and are valid (no out of bounds during any step).

But how to compute this. Since the starting position s can be any cell, perhaps we can model f[t][i] as the sum over all possible starting positions s of the number of paths starting at s that end at i after t steps, without any step going out of bounds.

Similarly, g[m][i] is the number of paths starting at i and making m steps, without going out of bounds. This is the same as f[m][j] but with the starting position fixed to i.

Wait, no. For g[m][i], the starting position is i, and the paths make m steps. So for m steps, the paths start at i and move in such a way that they don't go out of bounds during any step. So g[m][i] is the number of such paths. So, for each i and m, g[m][i] is the number of paths of m steps starting at i that are valid.

So for f, it's the sum over all starting positions s of the number of paths from s to i in t steps. So f[t][i] = sum_s (number of paths from s to i in t steps, valid for all steps).

Hmm, this might be a bit tricky. Let's model f and g using dynamic programming.

First, compute g[m][i] for all m up to k, and all i.

We can model g using DP. For m=0, g[0][i] = 1 (the path starts at i and makes 0 steps). For m >= 1, the number of paths is the sum of the paths from the previous steps. So:

For each m from 1 to k:
    for each i in 1..n:
        g[m][i] = (g[m-1][i-1] if i-1 >= 1 else 0) + (g[m-1][i+1] if i+1 <=n else 0)
        (all operations modulo MOD)

But wait, this is the standard way to compute the number of paths that make m steps starting from i, but wait no. Wait, g[m][i] is the number of paths starting at i and making m steps, each step moving left or right but not going out of bounds. Wait, no. Because for m steps starting at i, the first step can be left or right (if possible), etc. So the recurrence is correct. So for each step m, g[m][i] is the number of paths of m steps starting at i. So yes, the DP for g is manageable. The time complexity for this is O(nk), which is acceptable since n and k are up to 5000, giving 25e6 operations.

Now for f[t][i]. f[t][i] is the sum over all starting positions s of the number of paths starting at s and ending at i after t steps, without any out of bounds steps. So for each s, the number of paths from s to i in t steps, summed over all s.

But how to compute this efficiently. Let's see.

Let's model for each t, a DP that tracks the sum over all starting positions s. Let's define dp_f[t][i] as the sum over all s of the number of paths starting at s, ending at i in t steps, valid for all steps.

Then, dp_f[0][i] would be 1 for all i, since the path starts at i and makes 0 steps. For t=0, the sum over s is 1 for each i, but since s is the starting position, the initial state would be that dp_f[0][i] is 1 for each i. Wait, no. For t=0, the path starts at s, makes 0 steps, and ends at s. So for each i, the number of paths ending at i in 0 steps is 1 if s = i, else 0. So the sum over s is 1 for each i (since for each i, there is exactly one s (s=i) that contributes 1, others contribute 0). So dp_f[0][i] = 1 for all i.

For t >= 1:

dp_f[t][i] = sum over s (number of paths from s to i in t steps, valid).

But how to compute this. Let's think of it as for each step, the sum over all possible ways to reach i in t steps.

The recurrence would be similar to the standard paths DP. For each step, the number of paths ending at i is the sum of the number of paths ending at i-1 and i+1 in the previous step, multiplied by the possible transitions. But since the sum is over all starting positions, perhaps the DP for dp_f can be built as follows:

For t steps, the dp_f[t][i] is the sum over all possible previous positions (i-1 and i+1) of the dp_f[t-1][...], but since each step can come from left or right.

Wait, no. For each step t, the number of paths ending at i is equal to the number of paths that were at i-1 after t-1 steps and then moved right, plus the number of paths that were at i+1 after t-1 steps and then moved left. But this is for a fixed starting position. However, dp_f[t][i] is the sum over all starting positions. So for the first step, all starting positions contribute to their possible moves.

Alternatively, the recurrence for dp_f is similar to the DP for a single starting position, but for the sum over all starting positions.

So, for each t, dp_f[t][i] = (dp_f[t-1][i-1] + dp_f[t-1][i+1]), but adjusted for the boundaries.

Wait, for example, when i=1, the previous step can't be 0 (invalid), so only i+1 (2) contributes. But in this case, for t steps, the number of paths from all s that reach i in t steps is equal to the number of paths that could have been at i-1 (if i>1) or i+1 (if i <n) in t-1 steps, and then moved to i.

So the recurrence is:

dp_f[t][i] = (if i > 1 then dp_f[t-1][i-1] else 0) + (if i < n then dp_f[t-1][i+1] else 0)

But this is exactly the same recurrence as for the standard paths DP, except that here the initial condition is dp_f[0][i] = 1 for all i. Because for t=0, each starting position s contributes 1 path that ends at s (so sum over s gives 1 for each i). Wait, no. Wait, when t=0, the path starts at s and makes 0 steps. So for a given i, the sum over s of the number of paths ending at i is equal to 1 if i is in 1..n (since only s=i contributes 1, others contribute 0). So yes, dp_f[0][i] = 1 for all i.

But this recurrence for dp_f is exactly the same as if we were to compute the sum for all starting positions. So for example, if we have a grid and start with all positions having 1 path of 0 steps, then each step t builds the sum over all starting positions.

So, the DP for dp_f is similar to the standard grid walking problem, but with initial conditions set to 1 for all positions. Each step t, for each cell i, the value is the sum of the previous step's left and right neighbors.

So, the time complexity for computing dp_f is O(k * n), since for each of the k steps and each cell, we compute the new value based on the previous step. And similarly for the DP for g.

So, with both DP tables built, we can compute cnt[i] as sum over t=0 to k of (dp_f[t][i] * g[k - t][i}) modulo MOD.

Because for each t, the number of paths that pass through i at step t is equal to the number of ways to reach i in t steps (sum over all starting positions) multiplied by the number of ways to continue for the remaining (k - t) steps from i (g[k - t][i]).

Wait, but why is that correct? Because each full path is made of exactly k steps, and for such a path to have passed through i at step t, the first t steps must form a path that ends at i (summed over all starting positions), and the remaining (k - t) steps must form a path starting at i. So the total number of such paths is the product of the two values.

Yes. So this seems correct.

Once we have all dp_f and g computed, the cnt array can be computed as described.

Once we have cnt, the initial total sum is the sum of a_i * cnt[i] modulo MOD. For each query, when a_i is updated, we subtract the old a_i multiplied by cnt[i], then add the new value multiplied by cnt[i], and update the sum. So each query is O(1) time.

So the steps are:

1. Precompute dp_f and g.

2. Compute cnt[i] for each i.

3. Compute initial sum as sum(a_i * cnt[i]) mod MOD.

4. For each query, update the sum by subtracting the old a_i * cnt[i], adding the new a_i * cnt[i], and then output the new sum.

Now, let's think about the time constraints.

Computing dp_f and g:

Each has O(k * n) time. For k=5e3 and n=5e3, this is 5e3 *5e3 = 25e6 operations per DP, and two DPs (dp_f and g), so 5e7 operations. Which is acceptable.

Then, for each query, O(1) time. So with q=2e5, this is acceptable.

The memory required is O(nk) for both dp_f and g. For n=5e3 and k=5e3, each table is 5e3 *5e3 = 25e6 entries. Since each entry is an integer mod 1e9+7 (so stored as a 4-byte integer, for example), this is 25e6 * 4 bytes = 100MB per table, so two tables would be 200MB. But since the problem allows 1GB, this is manageable.

But wait, for each t in 0..k, we need to compute dp_f[t][i] and g[t][i]. So for dp_f, since each step t depends only on t-1, we can optimize space by using two 1D arrays: previous and current. Similarly for g.

Yes. Let's see:

For dp_f:

We can have two arrays, prev and curr. For each t from 1 to k:

curr[i] = (prev[i-1] if i>1 else 0) + (prev[i+1] if i <n else 0)

prev and curr can be arrays of size n+2 (to avoid index issues). Similarly for g.

This reduces the memory from O(nk) to O(n) for each DP. Which is much better. Because for k=5e3 and n=5e3, 5e3 * 5e3 is 25e6, which multiplied by 4 bytes is 100MB per DP. But using the optimized space, it's O(n) per DP, which is 5e3 * 4 bytes = 20KB per DP. So this is feasible.

So let's adjust the approach to use space-efficient DP.

First, compute the g[m][i] for all m up to k. But using a 2D array might be manageable. However, for k=5e3 and n=5e3, 5e3 *5e3 is 25 million entries. But perhaps for g, since m can be up to k, which is 5e3, and for each m we need the values for all cells, we can precompute a 2D array for g. However, with space constraints, maybe we can compute it using a 1D array.

But given the problem constraints (memory limit 1GB), it's manageable. For example, 5e3 *5e3 *4 bytes = 100MB for each 2D array. So for two arrays (dp_f and g), it's 200MB. Which is acceptable.

Alternatively, for g, since g[m][i] is the number of paths starting at i and making m steps, perhaps we can compute g in a way similar to the standard DP, using a 2D array. Let's proceed with that.

So the steps are:

Compute the DP for g:

Initialize a 2D array g of size (k+1) x (n+2). For each i, g[0][i] = 1 (since 0 steps, only the starting cell).

For each m from 1 to k:

    for each i from 1 to n:

        g[m][i] = (g[m-1][i-1] if i > 1 else 0) + (g[m-1][i+1] if i <n else 0)

        g[m][i] %= MOD

Similarly, for dp_f:

Initialize a 2D array dp_f of size (k+1) x (n+2). For m=0, dp_f[0][i] = 1 for all i.

For each m from 1 to k:

    for each i from 1 to n:

        dp_f[m][i] = (dp_f[m-1][i-1] if i > 1 else 0) + (dp_f[m-1][i+1] if i <n else 0)

        dp_f[m][i] %= MOD

Once these are computed, compute cnt[i] for each i:

cnt[i] = sum over t=0 to k of (dp_f[t][i] * g[k - t][i]) mod MOD

Once cnt is computed, the initial sum is sum(a[i] * cnt[i]) mod MOD.

Then, for each query, which changes a[i] to x, compute the new sum as (current_sum - old_a[i] * cnt[i] + new_x * cnt[i]) mod MOD. Since mod can be negative, we need to adjust to make it positive.

So, the plan is feasible.

Now, the code.

First, read n, k, q.

Then read a as a list (indexed from 1 to n).

Then compute g and dp_f.

Compute cnt[i] for each i.

Compute initial_sum.

Process each query: for each query, update a[i] and compute the new sum.

But wait, the initial a array is given, and then each query updates it. So we need to store the current a array and update it for each query.

Now, implementing this.

But in Python, 2D arrays can be implemented as lists of lists. For n=5e3 and k=5e3, this is manageable.

But for Python, even with 5e3 x5e3, each list of 5e3 elements (for each m) is manageable.

But for Python, using 5e3 x5e3 lists may take a lot of memory. Let's see: each integer is 28 bytes (assuming a list of ints, but for big numbers, but in Python it's stored as a reference). Wait, no. For Python lists, each element is a reference (8 bytes in 64-bit), but if the list contains integers, each integer is an object stored elsewhere. However, for a list of 5e3 elements, each being a list of 5e3 integers, this would be 5e3 *5e3 * 28 (if each integer is a separate object) which is 7e8 bytes (700MB) per array. But that's way too much for Python's memory constraints.

Wait, but in practice, when using NumPy arrays, this can be optimized, but the problem states that the code must not use any other output. So we have to use standard Python lists.

But 5e3 x5e3 is 25 million elements per array. So two arrays would be 50 million elements. Each element being a Python int (which takes some space). Let's see. Python's int is 28 bytes for small integers. But 50 million * 28 bytes is 1.4e9 bytes (1.4 GB). Which is over the memory limit of 1GB. So this approach is not feasible.

So the problem is that the space for the DP tables is too large for Python.

So we need to optimize the space usage. Let's think again.

The way to optimize space is to note that for each m, when computing dp_f[m][i], we only need the previous step's data. So we can use two 1D arrays for dp_f: previous and current. Similarly for g.

Yes. So for each of the DP tables (g and dp_f), we can use two 1D arrays and update them step by step.

Let's see.

For example, for dp_f:

prev = [0] * (n+2)

prev[1..n] = 1 (since for m=0, all cells are 1)

current = [0] * (n+2)

for m in 1 to k:

    for i in 1 to n:

        current[i] = (prev[i-1] if i>1 else 0) + (prev[i+1] if i <n else 0)

        current[i] %= MOD

    prev, current = current, [0]*(n+2)

But wait, after each step m, current becomes the new prev. So for each m, we can store the prev array. But we need to save all the steps' results for dp_f and g. Because to compute cnt[i], we need to sum over t=0 to k of dp_f[t][i] * g[k - t][i].

But if we don't store all the previous steps, we can't compute this sum. So for each i, we need to have the value of dp_f[t][i] for all t from 0 to k. So saving the entire DP_f and g for all steps is necessary. Which is not possible if we use only two arrays. So this suggests that the optimized space approach is not possible, because we need to store all t layers.

Hmm. So what can we do here?

Alternative idea: precompute for each i, the sum of dp_f[t][i] * g[k -t][i} over t from 0 to k.

But how to compute this sum without storing all the t layers.

Wait, during the computation of dp_f and g, perhaps we can compute the sum on the fly.

Let me think.

For each t from 0 to k, we need to multiply dp_f[t][i] by g[k - t][i} and sum over t.

So during the computation of dp_f and g, we can compute for each i the sum over t of (dp_f[t][i] * g[kt][i]), where kt = k -t.

But to compute this sum, we need to have both dp_f and g for all t.

But if we can compute both DP tables (dp_f and g) and for each i and t, compute the product and accumulate it.

But this requires that for each i and t, we have dp_f[t][i] and g[kt][i}.

So perhaps the way to proceed is:

1. Compute the DP for g. For all m from 0 to k, store g[m][i} for all i.

2. Compute the DP for dp_f. For each t from 0 to k, compute dp_f[t][i}, and for each i, accumulate the product with g[kt][i}, where kt = k - t.

But since kt ranges from k down to 0 as t ranges from 0 to k.

So during the computation of dp_f, for each t, we can calculate the term for t and for k - t. But perhaps it's more efficient to compute all dp_f and g first, then compute the sum.

But given the memory constraints, it's challenging to store both 2D arrays in Python.

Alternative approach: for each i, precompute the sum over t for dp_f[t][i] * g[k - t][i} by iterating t from 0 to k. But to do this, we need to have stored both dp_f and g for all t and i. Which is possible only if the memory allows.

In Python, for n=5e3 and k=5e3, storing two 2D arrays of size 5e3 x5e3 would require 25 million entries each. Each entry is an integer. So each array is 25 million integers. If each integer is stored in 4 bytes (as in C++), this would be 100MB per array. But in Python, integers are objects, and the overhead is much higher. So this would likely not fit into memory.

So what's the alternative?

Alternative idea: notice that for the sum over t, we can compute it during the DP steps, without storing all the steps.

But how?

Let's think differently. For each i, the cnt[i] is the sum for t in 0..k of (number of paths that reach i in t steps, summed over all s) multiplied by (number of paths starting at i and making k -t steps).

The key insight here is that the sum over t can be computed as a convolution-like operation. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, during the computation of the dp_f and g arrays, we can compute the sum on the fly.

For example, for each i, during the computation of dp_f[t][i}, multiply it by g[k -t][i} and add to cnt[i].

But since we need to have g[k -t][i} for all t, we can precompute the g array first.

So the steps would be:

1. Compute g for all m from 0 to k, and store it as a 2D array.

2. Compute dp_f for all t from 0 to k, and during the computation of each dp_f[t][i}, multiply by g[ k - t ][i} and accumulate into cnt[i}.

This way, we don't need to store the entire dp_f array. We can compute cnt[i} incrementally.

Yes! Because for each t, once we compute dp_f[t][i}, we can immediately multiply by g[k -t][i}, add it to cnt[i}, and then discard the previous dp_f values. So we don't need to store all t layers of dp_f; we can compute them one by one and accumulate the contribution to cnt.

Similarly, for the dp_f computation, we can use a 2D array that only keeps track of the current and previous layers, but we need to store all t layers. Wait, no. Because for t ranging from 0 to k, and for each t, we need to compute dp_f[t][i} and multiply by g[k -t][i}. So we need to compute dp_f[t][i} for each t, and multiply by g[k -t][i}.

But to compute dp_f[t][i} for all t, we need to store the previous layers. Wait, for dp_f[t][i}, the value depends on dp_f[t-1][i-1} and dp_f[t-1][i+1}. So for each t, we need to compute the current layer based on the previous layer. So we can use two 1D arrays: previous and current. For each t, compute current layer from the previous layer. Then, after computing the current layer for t, we can compute the contribution to cnt[i} as current[i} * g[k - t][i}, and accumulate that into cnt[i}.

But we can't store all the previous layers. So how to compute the sum for all t in 0..k?

For example:

Initialize previous = [0] * (n+2)
previous[1..n] = 1 (for t=0)

For t=0, compute contribution: previous[i} * g[k -0][i} = 1 * g[k][i}

Add to cnt[i}.

Then, for t from 1 to k:

    compute current[i} based on previous[i-1} and previous[i+1}

    compute contribution: current[i} * g[k -t][i}

    add this to cnt[i}

    previous = current.copy()

    current = [0]*(n+2)

So this way, we can compute the sum for all t, without storing all layers of dp_f. Only the previous and current layers are needed. This reduces the space for dp_f from O(kn) to O(n).

Yes! Because for each t, we compute the current layer based on the previous layer, then add to cnt[i} the current layer's contribution multiplied by g[k -t][i}.

This is feasible.

Similarly, for the g array, we can precompute all layers and store them. Because for each m in 0..k, we need g[m][i} to compute the contribution when t is such that k -t =m. For example, when t=0, k -t =k, so we need g[k][i}.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute g[m][i} for all m from 0 to k and i from 1 ton. Store this as a 2D array.

2. Compute dp_f in a space-efficient way, using two 1D arrays (previous and current). For each t in 0..k:

    compute dp_f[t][i} as current.

    add current[i} * g[k -t][i} to cnt[i}.

This way, we don't need to store all layers of dp_f.

So now, the space for g is O(kn), which for k=5e3 and n=5e3 is 25 million entries. In Python, this may be manageable if we use lists of lists, but for 25 million integers, it's possible but may be tight. Alternatively, perhaps using a list of lists with preallocated lists.

But given that the memory limit is 1GB, and each integer is stored as 4 bytes (but in Python, they are stored as objects, which take more space), this may be problematic.

Alternative idea: For g, precompute and store for each m, a list of integers. For m from 0 to k.

But for Python, this would require a list of (k+1) elements, each of which is a list of n+2 elements. For k=5e3 and n=5e3, this is 5e3 lists of 5e3 elements each, which is 25 million integers. But even with 4 bytes per integer, that's 100MB, which is manageable.

So for Python, it's possible.

So the code steps would be:

Read n, k, q.

Read a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

Compute g:

g is a list of (k+1) lists, each of size (n+2).

g[0][i] = 1 for i from 1 to n.

For m from 1 to k:

    for i from 1 to n:

        g[m][i] = (g[m-1][i-1] if i>1 else 0) + (g[m-1][i+1] if i <n else 0)

        mod it.

Compute dp_f in a space-efficient way and accumulate cnt[i}:

Initialize cnt = [0] * (n+2)

prev = [0]*(n+2)

for i in 1..n:

    prev[i] = 1

for t in 0..k:

    m = k - t

    for i in 1..n:

        cnt[i] += prev[i] * g[m][i]

        cnt[i] %= MOD

    if t ==k:

        break

    current = [0]*(n+2)

    for i in 1..n:

        current[i] = (prev[i-1] if i>1 else 0) + (prev[i+1] if i <n else 0)

        current[i] %= MOD

    prev = current.copy()

Wait, no. Because after t=0, we need to compute t=1, but in the loop above, after processing t=0, we compute current for t=1. Then for t=1, the code adds current[i} * g[k -1][i} to cnt[i}, etc.

Wait, no. Let's see:

Initially, prev is the dp_f[0] layer (all 1's for i=1..n).

For t in 0 to k:

    m = k - t

    contribution is prev[i} * g[m][i} --> because prev is dp_f[t][i}.

    So for t=0, m=k.

    add to cnt[i}.

    Then, if t <k, compute the next layer (t+1) into current.

So the code would be:

prev = [0]*(n+2)

for i in 1..n:

    prev[i] = 1

for t in range(0, k+1):

    m = k - t

    # current t is the step for dp_f[t][i}

    for i in 1..n:

        cnt[i] = (cnt[i] + prev[i] * g[m][i]) % MOD

    # compute next step if t <k

    if t <k:

        current = [0]*(n+2)

        for i in 1..n:

            current[i] = 0

            if i >1:

                current[i] += prev[i-1]

            if i <n:

                current[i] += prev[i+1]

            current[i] %= MOD

        prev = current

Yes. This way, for each t from 0 to k, the prev array holds dp_f[t][i}, and we multiply by g[m][i} (m= k-t) and accumulate into cnt[i}.

This approach avoids storing the entire dp_f array and uses O(n) space for the DP steps.

So now, the code can be written as follows:

Read n, k, q.

Read a's.

Compute g.

Compute cnt using the space-efficient DP for dp_f.

Compute the initial sum.

Process each query.

Now, let's code this.

But for Python, even with n=5e3 and k=5e3, this should be manageable.

Let's test the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

5 1 5

3 5 1 4 2

After the first update, a[1] becomes 9.

The initial sum is computed as follows.

But how? Let's compute the cnt array.

For k=1, the paths are all possible paths of 1 move (2 steps).

For each cell i, compute the sum over t=0 and t=1 of dp_f[t][i} * g[1-t][i}.

For example, for t=0, m=1: g[1][i} is the number of paths starting at i and making 1 move. So for i=1, g[1][1} is 1 (can only move to 2). For i=2, g[1][2} is 2 (can move to 1 or 3). For i=3, g[1][3} is 2 (move to 2 or 4). For i=4, g[1][4} is 2 (move to 3 or5). For i=5, g[1][5} is 1 (move to 4).

For dp_f[0][i} is 1 for all i. So when t=0, the contribution is 1 * g[1][i}.

For t=1, m=0: g[0][i} is 1 for all i. dp_f[1][i} is the sum over all starting positions s of the number of paths from s to i in 1 steps.

For example, for i=1: possible starting positions are s=2 (path 2→1). So dp_f[1][1} is 1 (only one path from s=2 to i=1 in 1 step). Similarly for other i's.

So cnt[i} = dp_f[0][i} * g[1][i} + dp_f[1][i} * g[0][i}.

So for i=1: cnt[1} = 1*1 + 1*1 = 2.

But in the first sample, the initial sum is after the first update 62.

Let's see. But maybe I should proceed to code.

Another thing to note: after computing cnt, the initial sum is sum(a[i] * cnt[i} mod MOD).

But the initial a array is read first.

So the code:

Read n, k, q.

a = list of integers (1-based).

precompute g.

precompute cnt.

Compute initial_sum = sum(a[i] * cnt[i} for i in 1..n) mod MOD.

For each query:

    i, x = input.

    delta = (x - a[i-1}) % MOD  # since a is 0-based in Python.

    initial_sum = (initial_sum + delta * cnt[i}) % MOD.

    a[i-1} = x.

    print initial_sum.

Because a[i] is stored as a list with 0-based index. So the code needs to adjust for 1-based input.

So, in code:

MOD = 10**9 +7.

Read n, k, q.

a = list(map(int, input().split())) → then, indexes 0 to n-1.

Then, compute g.

Initialize g as a list of (k+1) lists. For m in 0 to k.

g = [[0]*(n+2) for _ in range(k+1)]

for i in 1..n:

    g[0][i] = 1.

for m in 1 to k:

    for i in 1..n:

        g[m][i] = (g[m-1][i-1} if i>1 else 0) + (g[m-1][i+1} if i <n else 0)

        g[m][i] %= MOD.

Then compute cnt:

cnt = [0]*(n+2)

prev = [0]*(n+2)

for i in 1..n:

    prev[i] = 1

for t in 0 to k:

    m = k -t

    for i in 1..n:

        cnt[i] += prev[i] * g[m][i]

        cnt[i] %= MOD

    if t ==k:

        break

    current = [0]*(n+2)

    for i in 1..n:

        current[i] = 0

        if i>1:

            current[i] += prev[i-1]

        if i <n:

            current[i] += prev[i+1]

        current[i] %= MOD

    prev = current.copy()

Wait, but in Python, list assignment is by reference. So when we do prev = current, then modifying current will affect prev. So to copy the values, we need to do prev = current.copy() or prev = list(current).

But in the code, after computing current for t+1, prev is set to current. So after processing t, for the next iteration (t+1), prev is the current layer.

Yes.

Now, for the initial sum:

sum_ans = 0

for i in 1..n:

    sum_ans = (sum_ans + a[i-1] * cnt[i}) % MOD

Then, for each query:

i, x = map(int, input().split())

old_val = a[i-1]

delta = (x - old_val) % MOD

sum_ans = (sum_ans + delta * cnt[i}) % MOD

a[i-1] = x

print(sum_ans % MOD)

This should work.

Testing the first sample input:

Sample Input 1:

5 1 5

3 5 1 4 2

After initial computation:

cnt[i] for i=1 to 5:

For t=0: m=1.

g[1][1] = 1 (paths starting at 1, 1 move: can move to 2).

prev[i] for t=0 is 1 for all i.

So contribution to cnt[i} is 1 * g[1][i}.

i=1: 1*1 =1

i=2: 1*2=2

i=3:1*2=2

i=4:1*2=2

i=5:1*1=1

Then t=1: m=0.

current[i} is computed based on prev (which for t=0 was [0,1,1,1,1,1,0} (assuming indexes 0..6).

For i=1:

current[1} = prev[0} (0) + prev[2} (1) → 1.

Similarly, i=2: prev[1} (1) + prev[3} (1) → 2.

i=3: prev[2} (1) + prev[4} (1) → 2.

i=4: prev[3} (1) + prev[5} (1) → 2.

i=5: prev[4} (1) + prev[6} (0) → 1.

Then, contribution for t=1 (m=0):

g[0][i} is 1 for all i. So current[i} * 1.

So after adding:

cnt[i} is:

i=1: 1 +1 =2.

i=2: 2 + 2=4.

i=3:2 +2=4.

i=4:2 +2=4.

i=5:1 +1=2.

So the cnt array is [0,2,4,4,4,2} (indexes 0..5).

Initial a is [3,5,1,4,2].

So sum is 3*2 +5*4 +1*4 +4*4 +2*2 =6 +20 +4 +16 +4 =50. But according to the first sample, the initial sum after the first update is 62. Wait, but the first sample's initial a is [3,5,1,4,2}, then after the first update to a1=9, the sum becomes 62.

Ah, right. So the initial sum before any updates is 3*2 +5*4 +1*4 +4*4 +2*2 =6+20+4+16+4=50. But the first sample's initial output after the first update is 62, which is after changing a1 from 3 to 9. The difference is 9-3=6 multiplied by cnt[1}=2 gives +12, 50+12=62. So yes.

So the code seems correct.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But in Python, the code for the DP steps should be carefully implemented to handle the indices correctly.

Let's code:

Testing against sample input 1.
