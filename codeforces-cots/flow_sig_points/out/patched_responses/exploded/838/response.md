<think>
Okay, I have this programming problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and understand what's going on.

So the problem is about a matrix where Vasya moves a chip around based on certain rules. Each time he moves it to a cell with a strictly smaller value, and adds the square of the Euclidean distance between the current and previous cells. We need to compute the expected total score after all possible moves are exhausted.

Hmm. The challenge is to model the expected value here. Since each move is random and equiprobable among all possible smaller cells, this seems like a dynamic programming problem where the state is the current cell, and the transitions are determined by the cells with smaller values.

Wait, but for each cell, the possible next steps are all cells with a lower value. So the process forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG), because each step moves to a cell with a strictly smaller value, and thus cannot cycle. So the DAG can be processed in topological order.

The key idea is to process the cells in order of decreasing value. For each cell, we need to compute the expected sum of squared distances from that cell onwards. Then, when the chip is in a cell, the expected value is the sum of the expected values of all possible next steps plus the square distances added at each step, divided by the number of possible next steps.

But how do we model the transitions? Let's think recursively. Let's denote E[i][j] as the expected total score starting from cell (i,j). Then, when the chip is at (i,j), if there are k cells with a smaller value, each of those cells (x,y) contributes (E[x][y] + d²) to the expected value, where d is the Euclidean distance between (i,j) and (x,y). The total E[i][j] is the average of all these (E[x][y] + d²) values. If there are no smaller cells, E[i][j] is 0.

Wait, but the square of the Euclidean distance is (i - x)^2 + (j - y)^2. So for each possible next cell, the contribution to the expectation is the distance squared plus the expected value from that next cell. So the formula would be:

E[i][j] = (sum_{x,y} (E[x][y] + d^2)) / k, where the sum is over all (x,y) with a[x][y] < a[i][j], and k is the count of such cells.

If there are no such cells, then E[i][j] is 0.

So the approach is to sort all the cells in decreasing order of their values. Then, process each cell in this order. For each cell (i,j), compute E[i][j] by looking up all the cells with smaller values (which would have already been processed, since we process in decreasing order).

But how do we efficiently find all cells with a smaller value for each cell (i,j), especially when n and m can be up to 1000? Because for a 1000x1000 matrix, that's a million cells, and for each cell, checking all million other cells would be O(1e12), which is way too slow.

So we need a way to, for each cell (i,j), quickly find all cells with a strictly smaller a value. To do that, we can group cells by their value. So we can process the cells in descending order of their value. For each cell (i,j) with a certain value v, all the cells that come after in the processing order have values less than v. So when we process (i,j), all possible next cells (x,y) with a[x][y] < v have already been processed, so their E[x][y] values are known.

So the steps would be:

1. For all cells, compute their value and their coordinates. Then sort them in descending order of value. If two cells have the same value, they can be processed in any order since they cannot move to each other (since the value is equal, not strictly less). Wait, but the process only allows moving to cells with a strictly smaller value. So cells with the same value are not considered as possible next steps.

2. For each cell in the sorted list, compute E[i][j] based on the sum of (E[x][y] + d²) for all cells (x,y) that have already been processed (since their value is less than the current cell's value). The count of such cells is the number of possible next steps (k). So for each (i,j), we need to know the sum of E[x][y] plus the sum of d² for all (x,y) with a[x][y] < a[i][j].

But how do we compute this sum efficiently? Because for each (i,j), the possible next cells could be all cells with a lower value. For each such cell, the distance squared is (i - x)^2 + (j - y)^2. Expanding this, it's (i² - 2ix + x²) + (j² - 2jy + y²) = i² + j² - 2i x - 2j y + x² + y² + j²? Wait, no: (i - x)^2 + (j - y)^2 = i² - 2ix +x² + j² - 2jy + y². So sum over all (x,y) of d² is sum (i² + j²) - 2i sum x - 2j sum y + sum (x² + y²).

But sum (i² + j²) is (i² + j²) multiplied by the number of cells with lower value, since (i,j) is fixed here. Wait, no. For each (x,y) in the next steps, the distance squared is (i -x)^2 + (j - y)^2. So the sum over all (x,y) is sum_{x,y} [(i -x)^2 + (j - y)^2] = sum_{x,y} (i² - 2ix + x² + j² - 2jy + y²) = sum (i² + j²) - 2i sum x - 2j sum y + sum (x² + y²) + sum (x² + y²). Wait, maybe I should reorganize.

Wait, (i -x)^2 + (j - y)^2 = (i² - 2ix + x²) + (j² - 2jy + y²) = i² + j² - 2i x - 2j y + x² + y².

So the sum over all (x,y) of d² is equal to:

k*(i² + j²) - 2i * sum_x (x) - 2j * sum_y (y) + sum_x (x²) + sum_y (y²) multiplied by the number of terms. Wait, no: for each (x,y) in the next steps, we have x and y. So sum over all (x,y) of (i² + j²) is (i² + j²) * k, where k is the number of next steps. Then, subtract 2i times the sum of all x's in next steps, minus 2j times sum of all y's. Then add sum of x² + y² for all next steps.

So if we can precompute for each (i,j) the sum of x, sum of y, sum of x², sum of y², and the count k, then we can compute the total sum of d² quickly.

But how to compute these sums for each cell (i,j)?

Ah, here's the idea: for all cells with a value less than the current cell's value, we can track the cumulative sums of x, y, x², y², and the count k. Then, for each cell (i,j) being processed, we can compute the sum of d² as:

k * (i^2 + j^2) - 2*i*sum_x - 2*j*sum_y + sum_x2 + sum_y2.

Additionally, the sum of E[x][y] for all next steps is sum_E.

So for each (i,j), E[i][j] = (sum_E + sum_d_squared) / k, where k is the number of next steps. If k is zero, E is zero.

But how to efficiently track sum_x, sum_y, sum_x2, sum_y2, sum_E, and k for all cells with a value less than current?

Since we are processing the cells in decreasing order, we can maintain these cumulative variables. So, as we process each cell (x,y), we add x, y, x², y², and E[x][y] to the cumulative sums. Then, for any subsequent cell (i,j) with higher value (processed earlier), when they process, their sum_x would be the sum of all cells with a lower value (processed after them) which have already been added to these sums.

Wait, no. The processing order is in descending value. So when we process cell (i,j), all cells with lower values have already been processed and added to the cumulative sums. Wait no: if we process cells in descending order, then when we process a cell with value v, all cells with value less than v have already been processed. So, for example, when processing a cell with value 5, all cells with values 4,3, etc., have been processed. But in this case, the cells with lower values are processed before the higher ones. Wait no: if we process in descending order, then the first cell processed is the maximum value. Then the next is the next maximum, etc. So for a cell (i,j) with value v, all cells processed after it have values <= v. So when processing (i,j), the cumulative sums would include all cells processed before it, which have higher or equal values. But that's not correct, because the cells with lower values are processed after. So we need to track the sum of all cells with a value less than the current cell's value.

Wait, maybe the correct way is to process cells in order from highest to lowest. For each cell (i,j) with value v, when we process it, all cells that have a value less than v are already in the cumulative sums. Because those cells would have been processed earlier. Wait no. Because the cells with lower values are processed later. So processing in descending order means that the highest value is processed first. Then the next highest, etc. So for a cell (i,j) with value v, when we process it, all cells processed before it have values >= v. So the cells with values less than v are processed after. Therefore, the cumulative sums that we need for processing (i,j) must have the sum of all cells that have been processed after (i,j) is processed. Because those are the ones with lower values.

Hmm, this seems like a problem. Because for a cell (i,j) with value v, when we process it (in the sorted list from highest to lowest), any cell (x,y) that comes after in the processing order (i.e., with a value <= v) cannot be a candidate for moving. So we need to collect all cells (x,y) that have a value strictly less than v, which would have been processed later than (i,j). But that's not possible. So the approach of processing in descending order is incorrect.

Wait, this is a critical mistake. Let's think again. Suppose we have cells sorted in descending order. Then, the first cell processed is the maximum. The next is the next maximum, and so on. For a cell (i,j) with value v, all cells with a higher value have already been processed (they come before in the list). All cells with a lower value are processed after. So when we process (i,j), the cells with lower values have not been processed yet. Therefore, their E[x][y] values are not known. So we can't use them in the computation of E[i][j].

Oh right, that's a problem. Because when we process (i,j), the cells with lower values (which are the next steps) haven't been processed yet. So their E[x][y] values are not available.

So this suggests that the processing order should be in increasing order. Because then, when we process a cell (i,j), all cells with a higher value have already been processed. Wait, no. Let's think again.

If we process cells in increasing order of value, then when we process a cell (i,j) with value v, all cells with a lower value have been processed. So when (i,j) is processed, any cell (x,y) that is a possible next step (a[x][y] < v) has already been processed. So their E[x][y] values are known. Then, when we process (i,j), we can compute sum_E as the sum of E[x][y] for all cells (x,y) with a[x][y] < v. Similarly, sum_x, sum_y, etc., can be accumulated from those cells.

Wait, yes! Because when processing in increasing order, a cell (i,j) with value v will have all cells (x,y) with a[x][y] < v already processed. So their E[x][y] are computed and stored. Therefore, for (i,j), the sum of E[x][y] plus the sum of distances squared can be computed using those cells.

So the correct processing order is in increasing order of the cell values. Then, for each cell (i,j), all possible next steps (cells with lower value) have already been processed, so their E values are known. Then, for (i,j), we can compute E[i][j] as (sum_E + sum_d_squared) / k, where k is the number of next steps.

But how do we handle cells with the same value? Because if two cells have the same value, they cannot be next steps for each other. So in the processing order, when we process a cell (i,j) with value v, any cells with the same value v (processed after (i,j) if we sort in increasing order) are not considered. Because when (i,j) is processed, the sum of next steps includes only cells with a[x][y] < v. So cells with a[x][y] = v are not included.

Therefore, the correct approach is to process cells in increasing order. So here's the plan:

- For each cell, sort all cells in increasing order of their value. Then process them in that order. For each cell (i,j), during processing, collect all cells (x,y) that have a[x][y] < a[i][j], which have already been processed (since they are lower). For these cells, we can compute sum_x, sum_y, sum_x2, sum_y2, sum_E, and count k.

Wait, but how do we efficiently track the cumulative sums for all cells with value less than the current cell's value?

Since we process cells in increasing order, any cell processed before (i,j) could have a value less than or equal to a[i][j]. But for (i,j), the next steps are cells with a[x][y] < a[i][j]. So we need to track all cells processed before (i,j) where a[x][y] < a[i][j]. How can we do that?

But when processing cells in increasing order, the cells are sorted such that each next cell's value is >= the previous. So for example, suppose we have sorted cells in order: 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4. When processing a cell with value 3, all cells processed before it have value <= 3. But the cells with value 3 could be part of the same group. So, in this case, when processing a cell with value v, all cells processed before it have value <= v. But to find cells with value < v, we need to look at the previous cells where their value is strictly less than v.

So the key is that during the processing, we can group cells by their value and track the cumulative sums up to each group. For example, when processing a cell with value v, the sum of x, y, etc., for all cells with value < v is known. Because all those cells have been processed before.

But to track this, perhaps we can keep a list of the cells sorted by their value. Then, for each cell (i,j) with value v, the cells with value < v are all those that are before the first occurrence of v in the sorted list. So during processing, we can track for each value v, the cumulative sums up to the previous value.

But how to do this efficiently?

Alternatively, for each cell in the sorted list (in increasing order), we can maintain variables sum_x, sum_y, sum_x2, sum_y2, sum_E, and count, which accumulate the totals for all cells processed so far with a value less than the current cell's value.

Wait, but if multiple cells have the same value, they are processed in groups. For example, all cells with value 5 are processed together. For each of them, when processing, the sum of x, etc., for cells with value <5 is the same. So perhaps we can pre-process the sorted list into groups of cells with the same value, process these groups in order, and for each group, compute the sums up to the previous group.

So here's a plan:

1. Collect all cells into a list, and sort them in increasing order of their a[i][j] value.

2. Split the sorted list into groups where each group has the same a[i][j] value. For example, group 0 has a=1, group 1 a=2, etc.

3. For each group, compute the cumulative sum_x, sum_y, sum_x2, sum_y2, sum_E, and count, which are the sums of all cells in previous groups (i.e., with a < current group's a).

4. Then, for each cell in the current group, the next steps are the cells in the previous groups, so the sum for each cell in the group is (sum_E_prev + sum_d_squared_prev) / count_prev, where sum_d_squared_prev is computed using the sum_x_prev, sum_y_prev, etc.

But since all cells in the same group have the same a value, their next steps are the same set of cells (all previous groups). So for each group, we can precompute the sum_x_prev, sum_y_prev, sum_x2_prev, sum_y2_prev, sum_E_prev, count_prev. Then, for each cell in the group, we can compute their E[i][j] using these sums.

This way, we don't have to process each cell individually, but process groups of cells with the same value. This will save time because, for example, if a group has 1000 cells with the same value, their E[i][j] can be computed in O(1000) time instead of O(1000 * (sum over all previous cells)).

So the steps would be:

- Sort all cells in increasing order of a[i][j], and group them by their value.

- For each group, starting from the first (smallest a) to the last (largest a), compute the cumulative sums up to that group.

But wait, no. The groups are sorted in increasing order. So group 0 has the smallest a, group 1 the next, etc. For each group, when processing it, the cells in the group can transition to any cells in previous groups (i.e., a < current a). However, for the group with a certain value, all cells in that group can transition to any cells in previous groups (those with a < current a). So for all cells in the group, the sum_x_prev is the total sum of x's from all previous groups. Similarly for sum_y_prev, sum_x2_prev, sum_y2_prev, sum_E_prev, count_prev.

Thus, for each group, before processing it, we can compute the cumulative sums up to all previous groups. Then, for each cell in the group, we can compute E[i][j] as (sum_E_prev + sum_d_squared) / count_prev, where sum_d_squared is calculated as:

sum_d_squared = (i^2 + j^2)*count_prev - 2*i*sum_x_prev - 2*j*sum_y_prev + sum_x2_prev + sum_y2_prev

If count_prev is zero, then E[i][j] is zero.

But when a group has multiple cells with the same a value, processing them in a group is efficient. Because the sum_x_prev, etc., are the same for all cells in the group, since they all have the same a value. So each cell in the group can compute their individual E[i][j] using these same sums, but their own (i,j) coordinates.

So the algorithm would look like this:

Initialize cumulative variables sum_x_total, sum_y_total, sum_x2_total, sum_y2_total, sum_E_total, count_total. These variables accumulate the sum of x, y, x², y², E[i][j], and count of all cells processed so far (cells with a < current group's a).

Sort the cells into groups by their a value in increasing order.

For each group in the sorted list (starting from the first, smallest a):

    For each cell in this group:

        if count_total == 0:

            E[i][j] = 0

        else:

            sum_d_squared = (i^2 + j^2) * count_total - 2*i*sum_x_total - 2*j*sum_y_total + sum_x2_total + sum_y2_total

            E[i][j] = (sum_E_total + sum_d_squared) / count_total

    After processing all cells in the group, update the cumulative variables by adding all cells in this group:

        sum_x_total += sum of x's in this group

        sum_y_total += sum of y's in this group

        sum_x2_total += sum of x² in this group

        sum_y2_total += sum of y² in this group

        sum_E_total += sum of E[i][j] for all cells in this group

        count_total += number of cells in this group

Wait, but the cells in the current group have a value equal to the group's a. But when the next groups are processed (with higher a), these cells can be part of their possible next steps. So the cumulative variables are updated after processing the group. So when the next group (with higher a) is processed, the sum_x_total includes all previous groups, including this current group.

But that's not correct. Because for a cell in a higher group (a higher a), when processing, the possible next steps are cells with a < current a. So if the current group is being processed, and we are adding their x, y, etc., to the cumulative sums, then when a higher group is processed, the cumulative sums include the current group. But cells in the higher group have a higher a than the current group. So the current group's cells are part of the possible next steps for the higher group's cells.

But that's correct. Because when a higher group's cell is processed, the cumulative sums include all previous groups (with a < higher a). The current group's a is less than the higher group's a, so they are included in the possible next steps.

So yes, the algorithm is correct.

Now, the key steps are:

1. Sort all cells into groups of increasing a.

2. For each group in order, compute E[i][j] for each cell in the group using the cumulative sums from previous groups.

3. Update the cumulative sums with the current group's data.

This approach is efficient because for each group, the cumulative variables are computed once and used for all cells in the group. Processing each cell in the group is O(1) time, since the sum_d_squared is computed using the cumulative variables and the cell's own (i,j) coordinates.

Now, considering the constraints:

n and m can be up to 1000, leading to 1e6 cells. Sorting 1e6 cells is O(n log n), which is manageable. Then grouping them by value can be done in O(n) time. For each cell in each group, we process it in O(1) time. So the overall time is O(n log n + n) = O(n log n), which is acceptable for n=1e6.

But wait, the problem allows a[i][j] up to 1e9, but grouping by their value can be done using a dictionary. However, when the same value appears in multiple cells, they are grouped together. So the group list can be built by sorting the cells, then grouping consecutive cells with the same value.

So the steps to build the groups:

Sort all cells by their a value. Then iterate through the sorted list and group consecutive elements with the same a.

Once the groups are built, for each group, process the cells, compute E[i][j], then update the cumulative sums.

Now, the next step is to handle the modular inverse for the divisions. Since we need to compute E[i][j] as (sum_E_prev + sum_d_squared) / k, which is equivalent to (sum_E_prev + sum_d_squared) * inv(k) modulo 998244353, where inv(k) is the modular inverse of k modulo 998244353.

But k can be zero, but in that case, E[i][j] is zero. So during processing, when count_total is zero (i.e., no cells with a < current a), then E[i][j] is zero.

So in the code:

For each cell in the group:

    if count_total == 0:

        e = 0

    else:

        sum_d_sq = (i*i + j*j)*count_total 

        sum_d_sq -= 2*i*sum_x_total 

        sum_d_sq -= 2*j*sum_y_total 

        sum_d_sq += sum_x2_total 

        sum_d_sq += sum_y2_total 

        total_sum = (sum_E_total + sum_d_sq) 

        inv_k = pow(count_total, MOD-2, MOD)  # since MOD is prime

        e = (total_sum * inv_k) % MOD 

    E[i][j] = e 

Then, after processing all cells in the group, add their x, y, x^2, y^2, and e values to the cumulative sums.

But since we are dealing with modulo operations, we need to ensure that all arithmetic is done modulo MOD. However, since the problem requires that all divisions are handled via modular inverses, we must make sure that all additions and multiplications are performed under the modulo.

But the initial values (sum_x_total, sum_y_total, etc.) are accumulated modulo MOD. Wait, but x and y are coordinates (1-based indices up to 1e3). So x can be up to 1e3, so x^2 is up to 1e6, which is manageable. sum_x_total can be up to 1e6 cells * 1e3 = 1e9, which is manageable in Python's integers. But when multiplied by terms that could be up to (1e3)^2 (like i^2), which would be 1e6, then for a single term (i^2)*count_total: (1e6)*(1e6) = 1e12, which is okay. But when multiplied by 1e6 cells, the sum could be up to 1e18, which is manageable in Python's integers. So modulo operations can be applied at each step to prevent integer overflow, but since Python supports big integers, perhaps we can compute the terms first and then apply modulo. However, since the final answer is required modulo 998244353, all intermediate steps must be computed with mod operations to avoid integer overflow. Wait, but in Python, even big integers are handled, but the code's speed may be affected if the numbers become too large. So perhaps it's better to compute everything modulo MOD.

Wait, but the sum_d_squared can be a very large number. For example, sum_d_squared can be up to (1e3)^2 * 1e6 (count_total) terms. So (1e6 * 1e6) = 1e12 per cell, multiplied by 1e6 cells gives 1e18. Which is manageable in Python's integers, but when you multiply by 1e18, even in Python, it's possible. However, when applying mod 998244353, which is a 9-digit prime, we can compute all terms modulo MOD as we go. Because in modular arithmetic, (a + b) mod MOD is equal to ( (a mod MOD) + (b mod MOD) ) mod MOD, and similar for multiplication.

But the coordinates i and j are up to 1e3, so their squares are up to 1e6. So, for example, (i*i) mod MOD would be necessary if we are to compute everything modulo MOD. Wait, but the problem is that sum_d_squared is computed as:

sum_d_sq = (i^2 + j^2) * k_prev 

- 2i * sum_x_prev 

- 2j * sum_y_prev 

+ sum_x2_prev 

+ sum_y2_prev 

Each of these terms must be computed modulo MOD. So to prevent integer overflow (though in Python it's not a problem), but also to ensure that all operations are correct under MOD, we need to take each component modulo MOD.

So, during processing:

sum_x_prev is the sum of x's of all previous cells (with a < current a), modulo MOD.

sum_y_prev similarly.

sum_x2_prev is sum of x², modulo MOD.

sum_y2_prev similarly.

sum_E_prev is sum of E values of previous cells, modulo MOD.

k_prev is count_total, which is the number of previous cells, but since it's used as a denominator's inverse, we need to compute inv(k_prev) mod MOD.

So all variables (sum_x_total, sum_y_total, sum_x2_total, sum_y2_total, sum_E_total, count_total) are stored modulo MOD.

Wait, no. Because when we compute sum_x_total, it's the sum of all x's of previous cells, which can be up to 1e6 * 1e3 = 1e9, which is less than MOD (998244353 is ~1e9). So sum_x_total can be stored modulo MOD. Similarly, sum_y_total, sum_x2_total (sum of x² up to 1e3^2 * 1e6 = 1e9, which is mod 998244353). So yes, all these variables can be stored modulo MOD.

But how to compute sum_d_squared:

sum_d_squared = (i^2 + j^2) * k_prev 

- 2i * sum_x_prev 

- 2j * sum_y_prev 

+ sum_x2_prev 

+ sum_y2_prev 

Each term must be computed modulo MOD. For example, (i^2 + j^2) is computed mod MOD, multiplied by k_prev mod MOD. Then subtract (2i * sum_x_prev) mod MOD, etc.

So in code:

i_sq_plus_j_sq = (i*i + j*j) % MOD

term1 = (i_sq_plus_j_sq * k_prev) % MOD

term2 = (2 * i % MOD) * sum_x_prev % MOD

term2 = (term2 * -1) % MOD  # subtract 2i*sum_x_prev

term3 = (2 * j % MOD) * sum_y_prev % MOD

term3 = (term3 * -1) % MOD

term4 = sum_x2_prev % MOD

term5 = sum_y2_prev % MOD

sum_d_sq = (term1 + term2 + term3 + term4 + term5) % MOD

total_sum = (sum_E_prev + sum_d_sq) % MOD

e = (total_sum * inv_k_prev) % MOD

But wait, how to handle the negative terms. For example, -2i * sum_x_prev can be negative. So in modulo arithmetic, adding MOD and then taking mod MOD again ensures it's positive.

Alternatively, compute ( (i^2 + j^2) * k_prev ) mod MOD, then subtract (2i * sum_x_prev) mod MOD, subtract (2j * sum_y_prev) mod MOD, then add sum_x2_prev and sum_y2_prev, all mod MOD.

But in Python, the modulo operator handles negative numbers by returning a positive remainder.

So for example, (a - b) % MOD is equivalent to (a mod MOD - b mod MOD) % MOD.

So the code can be written as:

sum_d_sq = ( (i * i + j * j) * k_prev ) % MOD

sum_d_sq = (sum_d_sq - (2 * i * sum_x_prev) % MOD) % MOD

sum_d_sq = (sum_d_sq - (2 * j * sum_y_prev) % MOD) % MOD

sum_d_sq = (sum_d_sq + sum_x2_prev) % MOD

sum_d_sq = (sum_d_sq + sum_y2_prev) % MOD

But since MOD is a prime, all operations are done under mod MOD.

So all variables (sum_x_total, sum_y_total, sum_x2_total, sum_y2_total, sum_E_total, count_total) are maintained modulo MOD.

But wait, sum_x_total is the sum of x's of all previous cells. x can be up to 1e3, and the number of cells can be up to 1e6. So sum_x_total can be up to 1e9. So when stored as a regular integer, this is manageable. However, when stored modulo MOD (which is ~1e9), 1e9 is equal to MOD, so sum_x_total could be stored as a normal integer and then taken mod MOD when necessary. Alternatively, we can compute all sums modulo MOD from the beginning.

But when sum_x_total is 1e9, which is exactly MOD (assuming MOD is 998244353, which is 998244353), then 1e9 mod MOD would be 1e9 - MOD*1 = 1e9 - 998244353 = 1,755,647. So if we store the sums as mod MOD, we could lose information, leading to incorrect results.

Wait, this is a problem. Because sum_x_prev is sum of x's of previous cells, which can be up to 1e3 * 1e6 = 1e9. But 1e9 is larger than MOD (since MOD is 998244353, which is less than 1e9). So if we store sum_x_prev modulo MOD, then we lose the actual sum, leading to incorrect computation of sum_d_squared.

Oh, this is a critical mistake. Because when we compute sum_d_squared, the terms like (i^2 + j^2) * k_prev are based on the actual sum of previous cells, not their mod MOD values. For example, if sum_x_prev is stored modulo MOD, then sum_x_prev could be smaller than the actual sum, leading to a wrong term in the sum_d_squared calculation.

So this suggests that the variables sum_x_total, sum_y_total, sum_x2_total, sum_y2_total, sum_E_total, and count_total should be stored as actual integers, not modulo MOD. Because these sums are part of the formula for sum_d_squared, which is computed as a mathematical integer before applying the mod.

But with n and m up to 1e3, the maximum possible sum_x is 1e3 * 1e6 cells = 1e9. Which is manageable in Python as an integer. Similarly, sum_x2_total is sum of x², which for x up to 1e3, x² is 1e6 per cell, multiplied by 1e6 cells gives 1e12, which is also manageable in Python.

So storing these variables as regular integers is feasible. Only when calculating the sum_d_squared and sum_E_prev plus sum_d_squared do we need to apply mod MOD.

But sum_E_prev is the sum of E[i][j] of previous cells. Each E[i][j] is stored modulo MOD, so summing them would naturally accumulate to a value mod MOD. But sum_E_prev can be up to 1e6 * MOD, which is 1e15, which is manageable in Python.

But when sum_E_prev is added to sum_d_squared, which can be up to 1e12, the total can be up to 1e15 + 1e12 = 1e15, which again is manageable.

So the variables sum_x_total, sum_y_total, sum_x2_total, sum_y2_total, sum_E_total, and count_total should be stored as regular integers (not modded) because they are part of the sum_d_squared calculation. Only when calculating the sum_d_squared and sum_E_prev plus sum_d_squared do we take modulo MOD.

But sum_E_prev is the sum of E[i][j] values, which are already computed modulo MOD. So sum_E_prev is sum of (E[i][j] mod MOD) for each cell. So sum_E_prev can be stored as a modulo MOD value. Because when you add multiple numbers mod MOD, their sum mod MOD is equivalent to the sum of their individual mod MOD values.

For example, E1 mod MOD + E2 mod MOD = (E1 + E2) mod MOD.

Therefore, sum_E_total can be stored modulo MOD.

So to recap:

sum_x_total: sum of x coordinates of previous cells, stored as a regular integer (not modded).

sum_y_total: same.

sum_x2_total: sum of x squared coordinates of previous cells, stored as regular integer.

sum_y2_total: same.

sum_E_total: sum of E[i][j] values of previous cells, stored modulo MOD.

count_total: number of previous cells, stored as a regular integer.

When processing a cell (i,j) in the current group, we compute sum_d_squared as:

sum_d_sq = (i^2 + j^2) * count_total 

sum_d_sq -= 2 * i * sum_x_total 

sum_d_sq -= 2 * j * sum_y_total 

sum_d_sq += sum_x2_total 

sum_d_sq += sum_y2_total 

But these values can be very large. However, when we compute (sum_d_sq + sum_E_total) mod MOD, we have to compute it modulo MOD.

Wait, but sum_d_sq is a very large number, and sum_E_total is also a large number. So in Python, adding them would be manageable, but applying mod MOD may take time. However, Python can handle big integers efficiently, so it's feasible.

But the sum_d_sq could be up to:

For each cell (i,j):

i and j can be up to 1e3, so i² + j² is up to 2e6.

count_total can be up to 1e6.

So (i² + j²)*count_total is up to 2e6 * 1e6 = 2e12.

sum_x_total is up to 1e3 * 1e6 = 1e9. So 2*i*sum_x_total is up to 2*1e3 * 1e9 = 2e12.

sum_x2_total is up to 1e6 * 1e6 = 1e12 (since each x is up to 1e3, x² is up to 1e6 per cell, multiplied by 1e6 cells gives 1e12).

So sum_d_sq can be up to 2e12 (term1) + 2e12 (term2 and 3) + 1e12 (term4 and 5) = up to around 5e12. Adding sum_E_total (up to 1e6 * 1e9) which is 1e15. So the total can be up to 1e15 + 5e12 = 1.005e15. This is a large number but manageable in Python.

But when taking modulo MOD (998244353), this can be handled as (sum_d_sq + sum_E_total) % MOD.

So the code can proceed as follows:

For each cell in the group:

    if count_total == 0:

        e = 0

    else:

        # Compute sum_d_sq

        sum_d_sq = (i*i + j*j) * count_total 

        sum_d_sq -= 2 * i * sum_x_total 

        sum_d_sq -= 2 * j * sum_y_total 

        sum_d_sq += sum_x2_total 

        sum_d_sq += sum_y2_total 

        # Compute total_sum = sum_E_total + sum_d_sq

        total_sum = (sum_E_total + sum_d_sq) 

        # Compute inv_k_prev = inverse of count_total mod MOD

        inv_k_prev = pow(count_total, MOD-2, MOD)

        e = (total_sum % MOD) * inv_k_prev % MOD 

    # Add this e to sum_E_total

    # Also add x, y, x^2, y^2 to their respective sums

But wait, sum_E_total is stored modulo MOD. So sum_E_total is (sum of previous e's) mod MOD. So sum_E_prev is sum_E_total.

But when we compute total_sum = sum_E_prev + sum_d_sq, sum_E_prev is modulo MOD, and sum_d_sq is a large integer. So sum_E_prev can be small (mod 1e9), but sum_d_sq can be up to 5e12. So when adding, the total_sum is sum_E_prev + sum_d_sq, which is up to 5e12 + 1e9 = 5.001e12. This is manageable.

But then, the modulo is applied when calculating e = (total_sum % MOD) * inv_k_prev % MOD.

So this should work.

Now, the next step is to handle the grouping correctly.

In Python, to group the cells by their value, we can sort the list of cells, then iterate through the list and create groups where consecutive cells have the same value.

For example:

sorted_cells = sorted(cells, key=lambda x: x[0])

groups = []

current_group = []

current_val = None

for cell in sorted_cells:

    val, i, j = cell

    if val != current_val:

        if current_group:

            groups.append( (current_val, current_group) )

        current_val = val

        current_group = []

    current_group.append( (i, j) )

if current_group:

    groups.append( (current_val, current_group) )

Then, for each group in groups, we process them in order. For each cell (i,j) in the group:

sum_x_total is the sum of x coordinates of all cells in previous groups (those with a < current_val).

Similarly for sum_y_total, sum_x2_total, sum_y2_total.

sum_E_total is the sum of E[i][j] for all cells in previous groups, mod MOD.

count_total is the number of cells in previous groups.

So during processing:

sum_x_total, sum_y_total, sum_x2_total, sum_y2_total, sum_E_total, count_total are updated after processing each group.

For each group:

    val, cells_in_group = group

    # For each cell in this group:

    for i, j in cells_in_group:

        if count_total == 0:

            e = 0

        else:

            # compute sum_d_sq as explained

            sum_d_sq = (i*i + j*j)*count_total

            sum_d_sq -= 2*i * sum_x_total

            sum_d_sq -= 2*j * sum_y_total

            sum_d_sq += sum_x2_total

            sum_d_sq += sum_y2_total

            total_sum = sum_E_total + sum_d_sq

            inv_k = pow(count_total, MOD-2, MOD)

            e = (total_sum % MOD) * inv_k % MOD

        # store e for this cell

        # accumulate the variables for this group

        group_sum_x += i

        group_sum_y += j

        group_sum_x2 += i*i

        group_sum_y2 += j*j

        group_sum_E += e

        group_count += 1

        # also, store E[i][j] for later access (the starting cell)

    # after processing all cells in the group:

    sum_x_total += group_sum_x

    sum_y_total += group_sum_y

    sum_x2_total += group_sum_x2

    sum_y2_total += group_sum_y2

    sum_E_total = (sum_E_total + group_sum_E) % MOD

    count_total += group_count

But we need to keep track of the E[i][j] for the starting cell (r-1, c-1) in 0-based indices. Because when the input gives r and c (1-based), we need to find the E value for that cell.

But how do we store E[i][j] for each cell? Since the matrix is up to 1000x1000, and each cell's E is computed once, we can create a 2D array of E values.

So during processing each cell, we store E[i][j] in a matrix.

Wait, but for each cell in a group, the order of processing is arbitrary. For example, cells in the same group are processed in any order. Since their E values are computed based on previous groups (which are all cells with a < current val), their own E values do not depend on each other. So for cells in the same group, their E values can be computed in any order, since they are all based on previous groups.

So we can create a 2D array E of size n x m. Then, for each cell (i,j) in a group, compute E[i][j] and store it in the array.

Thus, the code steps are:

Read n, m.

Read the matrix a.

Read r, c (convert to 0-based indices).

Collect all cells into a list of tuples (a_val, i, j), where i and j are 0-based.

Sort the list in increasing order of a_val.

Group the sorted list into groups with the same a_val.

Initialize sum_x_total, sum_y_total, sum_x2_total, sum_y2_total, sum_E_total, count_total to 0.

Initialize a matrix E of size n x m to 0.

Process each group in order:

    group_val, cells_in_group = group

    group_sum_x = 0

    group_sum_y = 0

    group_sum_x2 = 0

    group_sum_y2 = 0

    group_sum_E = 0

    group_count = 0

    for (i, j) in cells_in_group:

        if count_total == 0:

            e = 0

        else:

            sum_d_sq = (i*i + j*j) * count_total

            sum_d_sq -= 2 * i * sum_x_total

            sum_d_sq -= 2 * j * sum_y_total

            sum_d_sq += sum_x2_total + sum_y2_total

            total_sum = sum_E_total + sum_d_sq

            inv_k = pow(count_total, MOD-2, MOD)

            e = (total_sum % MOD) * inv_k % MOD

        E[i][j] = e

        group_sum_x += i + 1  # wait, wait, the problem says rows and columns are 1-based. So the coordinates for distance are 1-based?

        group_sum_y += j + 1

        group_sum_x2 += (i+1) * (i+1)

        group_sum_y2 += (j+1) * (j+1)

        group_sum_E = (group_sum_E + e) % MOD

        group_count += 1

    sum_x_total += group_sum_x

    sum_y_total += group_sum_y

    sum_x2_total += group_sum_x2

    sum_y2_total += group_sum_y2

    sum_E_total = (sum_E_total + group_sum_E) % MOD

    count_total += group_count

Finally, output E[r][c] mod MOD.

Wait, wait! Oh no, this is a critical mistake. The coordinates in the problem are 1-based. The Euclidean distance is computed based on (i1, j1) and (i2, j2), which are 1-based indices.

So when we store the cells, the i and j variables are 0-based (as per the input processing), but the actual coordinates for distance calculation are (i+1, j+1).

Oh right! So in the code, when we read a cell (i,j) (0-based), the actual coordinates for distance calculation are (i+1, j+1).

So the code must use (i+1) and (j+1) when computing the sum_x_total, sum_y_total, sum_x2_total, sum_y2_total. Because the sum_x_total is the sum of x-coordinates (1-based) of all previous cells.

So this means that during grouping, when we process each cell (i,j), which is 0-based, the x and y for distance calculation are i+1 and j+1.

So the code must be adjusted:

For each cell (i,j) in the group (0-based), compute:

x = i + 1

y = j + 1

sum_d_sq = (x*x + y*y) * count_total 

sum_d_sq -= 2 * x * sum_x_total 

sum_d_sq -= 2 * y * sum_y_total 

sum_d_sq += sum_x2_total 

sum_d_sq += sum_y2_total 

But sum_x_total is the sum of x-coordinates (i+1) of all previous cells. sum_x2_total is the sum of x² ( (i+1)^2 ) of all previous cells.

So during the processing of the group, when accumulating the group's sum_x, sum_y, etc., we must use x = i+1 and y = j+1.

So in the code:

for each cell (i,j) in cells_in_group (0-based):

    x = i + 1

    y = j + 1

    sum_d_sq = (x*x + y*y) * count_total 

    sum_d_sq -= 2 * x * sum_x_total 

    sum_d_sq -= 2 * y * sum_y_total 

    sum_d_sq += sum_x2_total 

    sum_d_sq += sum_y2_total 

    ... 

And when adding to the group's sum:

group_sum_x += x 

group_sum_y += y 

group_sum_x2 += x * x 

group_sum_y2 += y * y 

This is a crucial correction. Previously, I had forgotten that the distance is computed using 1-based indices, which would have led to incorrect calculations.

So with this correction, the code will correctly compute the sum_d_squared based on the 1-based coordinates.

Now, after processing all groups, the answer is E[r-1][c-1], since r and c are 1-based and the matrix is stored 0-based.

Now, let's test this approach with the first example.

First example input:

1 4

1 1 2 1

1 3

The matrix is a single row with [1,1,2,1]. The chip starts at (1,3) which is 0-based (0,2). The value at (0,2) is 2.

The cells are:

cells = [(1,0,0), (1,0,1), (2,0,2), (1,0,3)]

Sorted in increasing order:

sorted_cells would be [1 (0,0), 1 (0,1), 1 (0,3), 2 (0,2)].

Groups:

Group 0: a=1, cells [(0,0), (0,1), (0,3)]

Group 1: a=2, cell [(0,2)]

Processing group 0 (a=1):

count_total is 0. So all cells in this group have e=0.

group_sum_x = sum of x (0+1=1, 0+1=1, 0+3+1=4? Wait, no:

Wait for group 0, the cells are (0-based i=0, j=0, 1, 3):

Processing each cell:

For cell (0,0): x = 0+1=1, y=0+1=1.

sum_x_total is 0 (count_total is 0).

sum_d_sq = (1^2 + 1^2)*0 - ... but count_total is 0. So e is 0.

Similarly for other cells in group 0.

group_sum_x for this group is 1 (cell 0,0) + 1+1= (0,1) x=0+1=1, (0,3) x=0+1=1. So group_sum_x = 1+1+1=3?

Wait, no. For cell (0,0), x=0+1=1. So group_sum_x += 1. For cell (0,1), x=0+1=1 again. group_sum_x +=1 again. For cell (0,3), x=0+1=1 again. So group_sum_x for this group is 1+1+1=3. Similarly group_sum_y is 1 (j=0 → y=1), 2 (j=1 → y=2), and 4 (j=3 → y=4), so group_sum_y is 1+2+4=7. sum_x2_total would be 1² +1² +1² =3. sum_y2_total would be 1² +2² +4²=1+4+16=21.

group_sum_E is 0+0+0=0.

After processing group 0:

sum_x_total =3, sum_y_total=7, sum_x2_total=3, sum_y2_total=21, sum_E_total=0, count_total=3.

Now processing group 1 (a=2), which has cell (0,2) → x=0+1=1, y=2+1=3.

For this cell:

count_total is 3 (from previous group).

sum_d_sq = (1^2 +3^2)*3 - 2*1*3 - 2*3*7 + 3 + 21.

Let's compute:

1^2 +3^2 = 1 +9=10.

10 *3=30.

2*1*3=6 → subtract 6 → 30-6=24.

2*3*7=42 → subtract 42 → 24-42= -18.

Add 3 → -18+3= -15.

Add 21 → -15+21=6.

sum_d_sq=6.

sum_E_total is 0. So total_sum =0 +6=6.

inv_k_prev = inv(3) mod MOD.

MOD is 998244353. 3 * 332748118 ≡ 1 mod MOD. So inv(3) is 332748118.

e=6 * 332748118 mod MOD.

6 * 332748118 = 1996488708. mod 998244353:

998244353 *2=1996488706. 1996488708 - 1996488706 = 2 → e=2.

Which matches the first example's expected output of 2.

So the code works for this example.

Now, for the second example, the code should compute the expected value correctly.

Now, the code must be written in Python, reading input from stdin, and output the correct answer.

Let's write the code:

First, read n and m.

Then read n lines of m integers each as the matrix.

Then read r and c, and convert to 0-based indices.

Collect all cells into a list of tuples (a_val, i, j).

Sort the list in increasing order of a_val.

Group the sorted list into groups with the same a_val.

Initialize the cumulative variables.

Process each group, updating E matrix.

Finally, output E[r][c] modulo MOD.

Now, code:

MOD = 998244353

n, m = map(int, input().split())

a = []

for _ in range(n):

    row = list(map(int, input().split()))

    a.append(row)

r, c = map(int, input().split())

r -= 1

c -= 1

cells = []

for i in range(n):

    for j in range(m):

        cells.append( (a[i][j], i, j) )

# Sort cells in increasing order of a_val

cells.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

# Group cells by a_val

groups = []

current_val = None

current_group = []

for cell in cells:

    val, i, j = cell

    if val != current_val:

        if current_group:

            groups.append( (current_val, current_group) )

        current_val = val

        current_group = []

    current_group.append( (i, j) )

if current_group:

    groups.append( (current_val, current_group) )

sum_x_total = 0

sum_y_total = 0

sum_x2_total = 0

sum_y2_total = 0

sum_E_total = 0

count_total = 0

E = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]

for group_val, group_cells in groups:

    group_sum_x = 0

    group_sum_y = 0

    group_sum_x2 = 0

    group_sum_y2 = 0

    group_sum_E = 0

    group_count = 0

    for i, j in group_cells:

        x = i + 1

        y = j + 1

        if count_total == 0:

            e = 0

        else:

            # Compute sum_d_sq

            sum_d_sq = (x * x + y * y) * count_total

            sum_d_sq -= 2 * x * sum_x_total

            sum_d_sq -= 2 * y * sum_y_total

            sum_d_sq += sum_x2_total

            sum_d_sq += sum_y2_total

            # Compute total_sum

            total_sum = sum_E_total + sum_d_sq

            inv_k = pow(count_total, MOD-2, MOD)

            e = (total_sum % MOD) * inv_k % MOD

        E[i][j] = e

        group_sum_x += x

        group_sum_y += y

        group_sum_x2 += x * x

        group_sum_y2 += y * y

        group_sum_E = (group_sum_E + e) % MOD

        group_count += 1

    # Update the cumulative sums

    sum_x_total += group_sum_x

    sum_y_total += group_sum_y

    sum_x2_total += group_sum_x2

    sum_y2_total += group_sum_y2

    sum_E_total = (sum_E_total + group_sum_E) % MOD

    count_total += group_count

print(E[r][c] % MOD)

Yes, this should work.

Testing the first example:

After processing group 0 (a=1), the group_sum_x is 1+1+1 = 3 (cells (0,0), (0,1), (0,3) are 0-based. Their x in 1-based is 1 for all, since i=0 for all. group_sum_x is 1+1+1 =3.

Then group 1 (a=2) has one cell (0,2) → x=1 (i=0+1=1), y=3 (j=2+1=3). sum_d_sq is (1+3^2)*3 - 2*1*3 - 2*3*7 + 3+21 = 10*3=30 -6-42=30-48= -18 +24=6. sum_E_total is 0. e=6 * inv(3) mod MOD=6 * 332748118 mod MOD= 1996488708 mod MOD=1996488708-2*998244353=1996488708-1996488706=2. So E[0][2] is 2.

The output is E[0][2] =2, which matches the first example.

For the second example, the code should compute the correct value.

So this should be the correct code.
