Okay, let's see. The problem is to arrange the members in an order such that the sum of discrepancies d_i is minimized. Each d_i is the difference between the max and min of the first i elements in the order. So for each i from 1 to n, we calculate that difference and sum them all.

Hmm. The key is to find an optimal order that minimizes this cumulative sum. Let's think about what the optimal arrangement might look like.

First, maybe the order should be such that each new element added either extends the current max or min. Because adding elements in the middle would cause the discrepancy to jump more. For example, if we have a sorted array, adding elements in sorted order would have each new element either increasing the max or decreasing the min. Wait, no. If you sort them in ascending order, then each new element is the new max, so the discrepancy increases by the difference between the new element and the previous max. But perhaps arranging them in a way that alternates between adding to the max and min ends.

Wait, I remember a similar problem. Oh right! This problem resembles the one where you arrange numbers in a sequence to minimize the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. The optimal approach there was to sort the array and then arrange them in a way that alternates between high and low. But this problem is different.

Alternatively, dynamic programming might be a good approach here. Let's think: when adding elements to the sequence, the current state depends on the current maximum and minimum, as well as the elements that have been used. But the problem is that with n up to 2000, the DP state can't be based on the set of used elements because that would be 2^2000 states, which is impossible.

Wait, but perhaps after sorting the array, the optimal arrangement is to build the sequence by adding elements to either end of the current sequence. This way, each step either extends the max or the min, keeping the discrepancy as small as possible. For example, if the sorted array is [a_1, a_2, ..., a_k], then the optimal sequence could be arranged by adding elements in a way that alternately appends to the left or right, ensuring that each new element only affects the max or min once.

So, if the elements are sorted, then the optimal arrangement is to arrange them in a way that starts from a certain point and expands either left or right. For example, you might have a sorted list, and the DP state can track the current left and right ends. Then, each step, you can add the next element either to the left (as the new min) or to the right (as the new max). The discrepancy for each step would be the current max minus the current min, which is a fixed value once the left and right are determined.

Wait, but the discrepancy for each step is the difference between the current max and min. So, for each i, when you have k elements in the current sequence (k from 1 to n), the discrepancy d_k is (current max - current min). But the sum of all d_i's would be the sum of these differences for each step.

But how do we model this? Let's think of the sorted array. Suppose after sorting, the elements are s_0, s_1, ..., s_{n-1} in non-decreasing order. Now, the problem is to choose the order in which to add elements such that each new element is either placed to the left (current min) or right (current max) of the current sequence. The key insight here is that once the array is sorted, adding elements in this way ensures that the discrepancy for each step is minimized.

So, the DP approach would track the current left and right indices in the sorted array. The idea is that the current sequence consists of all elements from left to right in the sorted array, and each step adds either the next element to the left or the right.

Wait, but how does that work? Let's see. Suppose we have the sorted array s = [a_0, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n-1}]. At any step, the current sequence's elements are a subset of the sorted array, contiguous in the sorted list. For example, if the current sequence includes from a_i to a_j (i <= j), then the next element to add would be a_{i-1} (extending to the left) or a_{j+1} (extending to the right). But how does this model capture the possible orderings?

Wait, this model assumes that the sequence is built by expanding left or right in the sorted array. So the elements in the sequence are a contiguous block in the sorted array. Then, for each step, the current max is a_j (the right end) and the current min is a_i (the left end). When you add a new element, you can either add a_{i-1} (making the new min a_{i-1}) or a_{j+1} (making the new max a_{j+1}).

But this only works if the elements added are contiguous in the sorted array. For example, if you start at some position k and then expand to left or right, then the elements are a contiguous block. But this would mean that the sequence is formed by a contiguous block in the sorted array, and the order is such that elements are added by expanding the block either to the left or right.

In this case, the discrepancy for a certain step (when the block is from i to j) is a_j - a_i, and the number of times this discrepancy is added to the sum depends on how many elements are added when the block is i to j. Wait, no. Because each time you add an element, the block increases by one. So the initial block is of size 1 (i = j), then size 2 (either i-1 or j+1), and so on. For each step, the block size is the current k (from 1 to n). So the discrepancy for each step k is the current a_j - a_i, where the block is of size k.

But wait, the sum is the sum of all discrepancies for each step from 1 to n. So for each k, the discrepancy is (current a_j - a_i) where the block is of size k. So if the block is built by expanding left or right, then for each size k, the discrepancy is a_j - a_i, which is fixed once the block's boundaries are known. So the problem reduces to choosing the order in which to expand the block (left or right) such that the sum of (a_j - a_i) * (number of steps where the block is of size k) is minimized.

Wait, no. For each step m (from 1 to n), the discrepancy is (current max - current min) which corresponds to the block's current size m. So for each step m, the sum includes (a_j - a_i) where j - i + 1 = m. So the sum is the sum over m=1 to n of (a_j - a_i) where the block after m steps is of size m, and the boundaries are such that j - i +1 = m. But how does the order of expansion affect the sum?

For example, consider a sorted array. Suppose you expand to the right each time. Then the block starts as [a_0], then [a_0, a_1], then [a_0, a_1, a_2], etc. So the discrepancies would be 0, a1 - a0, a2 - a0, etc. Summing those would be sum_{i=1 to n-1} (a_i - a0) * (n - i) ??? Wait no. Wait, for each step m (number of elements added), the discrepancy is (current max - current min). For the expanding right approach:

Step 1: m=1 → discrepancy 0.

Step 2: m=2 → discrepancy a1 - a0.

Step 3: m=3 → discrepancy a2 - a0.

...

Step n: discrepancy a_{n-1} - a0.

The sum would be (a1 - a0) + (a2 - a0) + ... + (a_{n-1} - a0) → sum_{k=1 to n-1} (a_k - a0).

Alternatively, if we expand to the left each time:

Start with a_{n-1}, then add a_{n-2}, etc. So step m=1 discrepancy 0, m=2 a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}, m=3 a_{n-1} - a_{n-3}, etc. Sum would be sum_{k=1 to n-1} (a_{n-1} - a_{k} ), where k is from 0 to n-2.

But which approach gives a better sum? It depends on the distribution of the elements. For example, if the elements are spaced evenly, perhaps expanding alternately in left and right would minimize the sum.

But how do we model this optimally?

This suggests that the optimal arrangement is to arrange the elements in a way that the block in the sorted array is built by choosing each time to add the next element either to the left or right, such that the sum of (current max - current min) for each step is minimized.

So the problem reduces to selecting the order of adding elements from the sorted list, expanding left or right, such that the sum of the differences (current max - current min) for each step (size 1, 2, ..., n) is minimized.

This can be modeled using dynamic programming. The state is the current left and right indices in the sorted array, since the current max is s[right], current min is s[left], and the number of elements considered is (right - left + 1). The transition would be to choose to add the next element either to the left (left-1) or to the right (right+1), and accumulate the cost (current max - current min) for each step.

Wait, but when you add a new element to the left (s[left-1]), the new min is s[left-1], and the max remains s[right]. So for the next step (which is when you have (right - (left-1) +1) = (right - left +2) elements?), but wait, the steps are for each element added. Hmm. Let me think again.

Each step corresponds to adding one element. The first element is step 1, then step 2 adds the second, etc. The discrepancy for each step m is (current max - current min) after adding m elements.

So for the DP approach:

We can model the state as the current left and right indices in the sorted array, which represents that the current sequence includes all elements from s[left] to s[right]. The number of elements in this state is (right - left +1) = m. So when we add a new element, m increases by 1.

But wait, how can we have a DP state that tracks left and right, and the number of elements? Because for a state (left, right), the number of elements is right - left +1. So the step is m = right - left +1.

The DP table would track the minimal sum up to this state (left, right). The transitions would be:

- From (left, right), you can add the next element to the left (s[left-1]) → new state (left-1, right). The added discrepancy for the next step (m+1) is s[right] - s[left-1].

- Or, add the next element to the right (s[right+1]) → new state (left, right+1). The added discrepancy for the next step (m+1) is s[right+1] - s[left].

The initial states are all possible single elements, i.e., for each i in 0..n-1, the state (i, i) with sum 0 (since m=1, discrepancy is 0). Then, we need to build up the DP table by expanding left or right.

The final answer is the minimal sum when the state is (0, n-1), which represents all elements being added.

But wait, the problem allows any order of the elements, but this DP model is based on building a contiguous block in the sorted array. Is that sufficient to cover all possible optimal orderings?

Hmm. Let's think. Suppose the optimal sequence is not a contiguous block in the sorted array. For example, maybe after some steps, you add elements that are not adjacent in the sorted array. But in that case, the discrepancy for that step would be the current max minus current min, which would be larger than if the elements were contiguous. Because the max and min would be further apart. So maybe the optimal arrangement must be a contiguous block in the sorted array, added in order either expanding left or right. Because adding non-contiguous elements would result in higher discrepancies.

So the DP approach where we track left and right in the sorted array is valid because any optimal sequence must be built by expanding the left or right of a contiguous sorted block. This is a crucial insight.

Therefore, the solution is to sort the array first, then use dynamic programming to compute the minimal sum of discrepancies by expanding the current block to the left or right.

Now, the steps for the solution are:

1. Sort the array s in non-decreasing order.

2. Use dynamic programming where the state is (left, right), representing that the current block consists of s[left] to s[right]. The value stored is the minimal sum of discrepancies up to this block.

3. For each state (left, right), the transitions are to either add s[left-1] (if left > 0) to the left, resulting in state (left-1, right), or add s[right+1] (if right < n-1) to the right, resulting in state (left, right+1). The cost added is the discrepancy (s[right] - s[left]) multiplied by the number of steps that this discrepancy contributes. Wait, no. Wait, each time you expand the block from size m to m+1, the discrepancy for the next step (m+1) is the new max and min. But the sum of discrepancies is the sum for each step. So when you are in state (left, right), which has m = right - left +1 elements, the sum so far includes the discrepancies for all steps up to m. When you expand to (left-1, right) (size m+1), the new discrepancy is (s[right] - s[left-1]). This discrepancy is added once to the sum. Similarly, expanding to the right adds (s[right+1] - s[left]).

So the DP recurrence is:

dp[left][right] = min(
    dp[left+1][right] + (s[right] - s[left]) * (new_m - current_m),  // Wait, no. Wait, each expansion adds exactly one step. For example, when expanding from m=3 to m=4, the new discrepancy is (new_max - new_min), which is added once (for step 4).

Wait, no. Each expansion step corresponds to adding one element, so for each transition from a state of size m to m+1, the new discrepancy is (new_max - new_min), and that's added once to the sum.

So the recurrence is:

For each state (left, right), the sum is the sum up to m elements. To transition to (left-1, right), the sum increases by (s[right] - s[left-1]). Similarly for the right side.

Wait, but the DP state (left, right) represents the sum of discrepancies for the steps 1 to m, where m = right - left +1. Then, when expanding left to (left-1, right), the new m is (right - (left-1) +1) = right - left +2. The discrepancy for this new step (m+1) is (s[right] - s[left-1]). So the transition is:

dp[left-1][right] = min(
    dp[left-1][right], 
    dp[left][right] + (s[right] - s[left-1])
)

Similarly, expanding to the right:

dp[left][right+1] = min(
    dp[left][right+1], 
    dp[left][right] + (s[right+1] - s[left])
)

So the DP transitions are based on adding the new discrepancy once per expansion.

The initial state is for each possible (i, i) where left = right, the sum is 0 (since d_1 is 0).

The answer is the minimal sum when the block is from 0 to n-1 (all elements).

But with n up to 2000, the DP table would have O(n^2) states. Each state has up to two transitions. So the total time complexity is O(n^2), which for n=2000 is 4,000,000 operations. That's acceptable for the time constraints.

But the DP needs to be filled in the right order. Since the transitions are from smaller intervals to larger ones, perhaps we can iterate over the possible interval lengths. For each possible length l (from 1 to n), iterate over all possible left indices, compute the right index (left + l - 1), and for each such (left, right), update the transitions to left-1 and right+1.

Wait, no. For each interval (left, right), the possible transitions are to (left-1, right) and (left, right+1). So we need to process the intervals in order of increasing length. Because for a given interval of length l, transitions from intervals of length l can generate intervals of length l+1. So the order of processing should be by the length of the interval.

So the algorithm steps would be:

- Sort the array.

- Initialize a DP table where dp[left][right] is the minimal sum for the interval (left, right).

- For all possible left and right where left > right, set dp[left][right] to infinity or some invalid value.

- For each single element (left = right), set dp[left][right] = 0.

- Iterate over the length of the interval from 1 to n. For each length l, iterate over all possible left values. The right is left + l - 1. For each such interval, check if it's possible to expand left or right.

Wait, maybe the correct order is to process the intervals in order of increasing length. For each interval (left, right) of length l, we can generate transitions to intervals of length l+1 by expanding left or right. So for each interval, after processing it, we can update the possible next intervals.

Alternatively, since each interval (left, right) can be reached by expanding left or right from (left+1, right) or (left, right-1), perhaps we can process the intervals in order of increasing length. For example, intervals of length 1 are processed first (all single elements), then intervals of length 2, etc.

Wait, no. For example, the interval (left, right) can be formed by expanding left from (left+1, right) or expanding right from (left, right-1). So for each interval (left, right) of length l, the possible transitions are to expand to (left-1, right) or (left, right+1). But to compute the DP for (left, right), we need to have processed the smaller intervals that can reach it. Wait, perhaps the order is to process intervals in order of their size. For each interval of size l, we process all possible left and right, and then for each such interval, we can generate transitions to intervals of size l+1.

Let me think again. For an interval of size l (like 3), it can generate intervals of size l+1 (4) by expanding left or right. So the correct approach is to process intervals in order of increasing size. So for l from 1 to n, for each interval of size l, compute the minimal sum, and then use that to update the possible transitions.

Wait, but the initial intervals are of size 1. Then, for each interval of size 1, we can expand to size 2 by adding left or right. Then, for size 2, we can expand to size 3, etc.

So the processing order is based on the current interval's length. So for each possible interval length l in 1 to n, we process all intervals of that length, and for each, compute transitions to l+1 intervals.

But how to implement this? For example, for l in 1 to n:

For each left in 0 to (n-1) - (l-1):

right = left + l-1

Then, for this interval (left, right), check if we can expand left (if left >0) or right (if right < n-1). For each possible expansion, compute the new sum and update the next interval.

Wait, but this would require that when processing an interval of length l, all possible transitions to length l+1 are considered.

Yes. So the code would look something like this:

Sort the array.

Initialize a DP table with dimensions n x n, filled with infinity.

For all i from 0 to n-1:

   dp[i][i] = 0

For l from 1 to n-1:

   for left in 0 to n-1 - l:

       right = left + l

       # Consider expanding to the left (if possible)

       if left > 0:

           new_left = left -1

           cost = dp[left][right] + (s[right] - s[new_left]) 

           if dp[new_left][right] > cost:

               dp[new_left][right] = cost

       # Consider expanding to the right (if possible)

       if right < n-1:

           new_right = right +1

           cost = dp[left][right] + (s[new_right] - s[left])

           if dp[left][new_right] > cost:

               dp[left][new_right] = cost

Wait, but this seems inverted. Because for a given interval of length l, the transitions are to intervals of length l+1. So perhaps the code should iterate over all possible intervals of length l, and for each, compute the transitions to l+1.

But the way to process this is to first process all intervals of length 1, then intervals of length 2, and so on. Wait, no. Because intervals of length l can be processed only after intervals of length l-1. Because the transitions are from intervals of length l to l+1.

Wait, perhaps the code should process intervals in order of increasing length. For each length l from 1 to n:

   For all intervals of length l:

       compute transitions to l+1.

But how do we get the intervals of length l? For l=1, it's all (i,i). For l=2, it's (i, i+1), etc. But that's not the case. Because when you expand left or right, you can have intervals of varying lengths. For example, starting with (i, i) (length 1), you can expand to (i-1, i) (length 2) or (i, i+1) (length 2). Then, from (i-1, i) (length 2), you can expand left to (i-2, i) (length 3), or right to (i-1, i+1) (length 3). So the possible lengths are 1, 2, ..., n.

Thus, the correct approach is to process intervals in order of their length. For each possible interval length from 1 to n:

   For each possible interval of length l:

       check if it's possible to expand left or right, and update the DP for the new intervals (length l+1).

But this approach would require that for each interval of length l, you generate the transitions to l+1.

So for l in 1 to n-1:

   for left in 0 to (n-1 - l):

       right = left + l

       if left >0:

           new_left = left -1

           new_sum = dp[left][right] + (s[right] - s[new_left])

           if dp[new_left][right] > new_sum:

               dp[new_left][right] = new_sum

       if right < n-1:

           new_right = right +1

           new_sum = dp[left][right] + (s[right+1] - s[left])

           if dp[left][new_right] > new_sum:

               dp[left][new_right] = new_sum

Wait, but this logic is processing intervals of length l, and for each, expanding to the left or right. For example, an interval of length l can expand left (if possible) to create a new interval of length l+1 (from new_left to right). Similarly for expanding right.

But this would process all intervals in order of increasing l. For example, for l=1 (length 1):

left can be 0 to n-2 (since left +1 <= n-1). For each such left, right = left +1. Wait, no. Wait, when l=1, the interval is left to left. Then, when expanding to the left, new_left is left-1, and the new interval is (left-1, left), which has length 2. Similarly for expanding to the right.

But in the code above, for l in 1 to n-1:

   for left in 0 to (n-1 - l):

       right = left + l

Wait, this would mean that when l=1, the loop for left runs from 0 to (n-1 -1) → 0 to n-2. But the interval (left, right) would be (left, left +1) → length 2. So this code is processing intervals of length l+1. Hmm, this seems incorrect.

Ah, I think there's a confusion here. Let's clarify:

The interval (left, right) has length right - left +1. So, for example, (left, left) has length 1. To process intervals of length l, the code should generate left and right such that right - left +1 = l.

So the code should iterate l from 1 to n (possible interval lengths), and for each l, iterate left from 0 to n-l (so that right = left + l-1).

So for each l in 1 to n:

   for left in 0 to n - l:

       right = left + l-1

       process transitions.

But in the code I wrote earlier, l is the previous length. So perhaps the correct approach is:

Initialize DP[i][i] = 0 for all i.

For each possible interval length l from 1 to n-1:

   for each interval (left, right) of length l:

       check transitions to left-1 and right+1.

So, code steps:

Sort the array.

n = len(s)

dp = [[infinity for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]

for i in range(n):

    dp[i][i] = 0

for length in range(1, n):

    for left in range(n - length):

        right = left + length

        # Expand to left

        if left > 0:

            new_left = left -1

            new_sum = dp[left][right] + (s[right] - s[new_left])

            if new_sum < dp[new_left][right]:

                dp[new_left][right] = new_sum

        # Expand to right

        if right < n-1:

            new_right = right +1

            new_sum = dp[left][right] + (s[new_right] - s[left])

            if new_sum < dp[left][new_right]:

                dp[left][new_right] = new_sum

Wait, but in this code, when processing intervals of length 'length', the code is considering intervals (left, right) where right = left + length. But the interval (left, right) would have length (right - left) +1. So for example, if length is 1, right = left +1 → interval length is 2. So this code is processing intervals of increasing length from 1 (which corresponds to length 2 in terms of the interval). So this seems incorrect.

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

If 'length' in the loop is the current length minus 1. For example, when the code says 'for length in range(1, n):', and 'right = left + length', then the interval (left, right) is (left, left + length), which has length (left + length - left +1) = length +1. So the code is processing intervals of length from 2 to n. Because 'length' starts at 1 and goes to n-1. So intervals of length 2, 3, ..., n.

But then, the initial states are intervals of length 1. How are they processed?

The code first initializes all intervals of length 1 (i, i) with sum 0. Then, for intervals of length 2 (processed when length=1), then 3, etc.

But then, the code's transitions are from intervals of length l to l+1. But the code is not handling that correctly.

Hmm, perhaps the code should process intervals in order of their length, starting from 1. So for l in 1 to n:

   process all intervals of length l.

But how to generate the transitions?

Wait, let's see. For each interval of length l, we can transition to two possible intervals of length l+1 (if possible). So the code should process intervals in order of l from 1 to n-1.

Wait, but for l = n, the interval is the entire array, so there's no expansion possible.

So here's the correct approach:

Sort the array.

Initialize a DP table where dp[left][right] represents the minimal sum for the interval [left..right].

Set dp[i][i] = 0 for all i.

For each interval length l from 1 to n-1:

   For each possible left in 0 to (n-1) - l:

       right = left + l

       current sum is dp[left][right]

       Expand to left:

           new_left = left -1

           new_sum = current sum + (s[right] - s[new_left])

           If new_left >=0, update dp[new_left][right] = min( existing value, new_sum )

       Expand to right:

           new_right = right +1

           new_sum = current sum + (s[new_right] - s[left])

           If new_right <n, update dp[left][new_right] = min( existing value, new_sum )

But wait, the length of the interval (left, right) is (right - left +1). For example, when l=1 (the first iteration), the code processes intervals of length 2 (since right = left +1). Then, transitions to longer intervals.

But that's not correct. Because the initial state is intervals of length 1 (i, i), and the next transitions are to intervals of length 2.

So the code should process intervals in order of their actual length. Let's think again.

The code should process intervals in order of their length from 1 to n. For each interval of length l, we can expand left or right to get intervals of length l+1.

So the code should loop for l in 1 to n:

   for each interval of length l:

       process transitions to l+1.

But how to generate intervals of length l? For l in 1 to n:

   for left in 0 to (n- l):

       right = left + l -1

So for example, l=1: left ranges from 0 to n-1, right = left +0 → (left, left), length 1.

Then, for each such interval, check possible expansions to left-1 or right+1.

Wait, but for an interval of length l, the expansion to the left would create a new interval (left-1, right), which is of length l+1. Similarly for expansion to the right.

So the code should be:

for l in 1 to n:

   for left in 0 to (n - l):

       right = left + l -1

       if l ==1:

           current_sum = 0

       else:

           current_sum = dp[left][right]

       # expand to the left

       if left >0:

           new_left = left -1

           new_right = right

           new_sum = current_sum + (s[new_right] - s[new_left])

           if new_sum < dp[new_left][new_right]:

               dp[new_left][new_right] = new_sum

       # expand to the right

       if right <n-1:

           new_left = left

           new_right = right +1

           new_sum = current_sum + (s[new_right] - s[new_left])

           if new_sum < dp[new_left][new_right]:

               dp[new_left][new_right] = new_sum

But wait, this code would process each interval of length l, then for each possible expansion to left or right, update the next intervals of length l+1.

But the initial loop is for l in 1 to n. For l=1, the code processes intervals of length 1. For each such interval, expands to left or right, creating intervals of length 2. Then, for l=2, it processes intervals of length 2, which were filled during the previous step, and so on.

Yes, that's correct. So the code should process intervals in order of their length, and for each, generate transitions to longer intervals.

But the code in this case has nested loops:

Sort s.

Initialize dp as a 2D array with infinity.

Set dp[i][i] =0 for all i.

for l in range(1, n):

    for left in range(n - l +1):

        right = left + l -1

        current_sum = dp[left][right]

        # expand to left

        if left >0:

            new_left = left-1

            new_right = right

            new_cost = current_sum + (s[right] - s[new_left])

            if new_cost < dp[new_left][new_right]:

                dp[new_left][new_right] = new_cost

        # expand to right

        if right < n-1:

            new_left = left

            new_right = right+1

            new_cost = current_sum + (s[new_right] - s[left])

            if new_cost < dp[new_left][new_right]:

                dp[new_left][new_right] = new_cost

Wait, the loop for l starts from 1 to n-1 (since for l=1 to n-1, we can expand to l+1 up to n).

But in code, the outer loop would be for l in 1 to n-1, inclusive. For each such l, we process all intervals of length l. Then, for each interval, expand to left or right, generating intervals of length l+1.

So the code would correctly fill the DP table for all intervals of length up to n.

Finally, the answer is dp[0][n-1], which represents the interval covering all elements.

Testing this approach with the first example:

Sample Input 1:

3

3 1 2 → sorted [1, 2, 3]

Then, the steps are:

Initialize dp[0][0] =0, dp[1][1]=0, dp[2][2]=0.

Processing l=1 (length 1):

For each interval of length 1:

left=0, right=0:

expand to left: left-1=-1 (invalid).

expand to right: right+1=1. new_sum=0 + (s[1]-s[0]) → 2-1=1. So dp[0][1] =1.

left=1, right=1:

expand to left: 0. new_sum=0 + (s[1]-s[0}) → 1. So dp[0][1] is min( existing 1, 0+1=1 → remains 1.

expand to right: 2. new_sum=0 + (s[2]-s[1})=1. So dp[1][2] =1.

left=2, right=2:

expand to left: 1. new_sum=0 + (s[2]-s[1})=1. dp[1][2] = min(1, 0+1=1) → remains 1.

No expansion to right possible.

Now, processing l=2 (length 2):

Intervals of length 2 are (0,1) and (1,2).

For (0,1):

current_sum=1.

expand to left: new_left=-1 (invalid).

expand to right: right+1=2. new_sum=1 + (3-1) = 1+2=3. So dp[0][2] =3.

For (1,2):

current_sum=1.

expand to left:0. new_sum=1 + (s[2]-s[0})=3-1=2 → 1+2=3. dp[0][2] is min(3, 3) → remains 3.

expand to right: invalid.

Processing l=3 (n=3, l ranges up to 2):

No, since in code, l ranges from 1 to n-1. So for n=3, l runs up to 2.

So the answer is dp[0][2] =3, which matches the sample.

Another sample input: when n=1, output is 0.

So the code seems correct.

Now, let's think about the time and space constraints.

n=2000. The DP table is 2000x2000, which is 4,000,000 entries. Each entry is a number (the sum). In Python, using a 2D list of integers is feasible. The space should be manageable.

The time complexity is O(n^2), since for each of the O(n^2) intervals, we process each once, and each has two transitions. So 4,000,000 *2 =8 million operations, which is acceptable.

But in Python, with the loops and all, it's important to manage the code efficiently.

Now, implementing this in Python.

First, read the input: n and s. Sort s.

Then, initialize the DP table. For Python, using a 2D list of size n x n, filled with a large value (like infinity), then setting dp[i][i] =0.

Then, for l in 1 to n-1 (since the maximum possible l in the loop is n-1, because for l in range(1, n) → for n=3, l is 1,2).

Wait, in Python, the loop would be for l in range(1, n):

Because for n=3, l ranges from 1 to 2 (inclusive). Which is correct.

So the code would be:

Read n.

Read list s.

Sort s.

Initialize dp as a 2D array with n rows and n columns.

for i in range(n):

    for j in range(n):

        if i ==j:

            dp[i][j] =0

        else:

            dp[i][j] = some large number, like 1e18.

Then, for l in 1 to n-1:

   for left in 0 to (n- l):

       right = left + l -1

       current_sum = dp[left][right]

       expand to left and right.

Wait, wait, for each interval of length l, the code should process left in 0 to (n - l). Because for length l, the right is left + l -1. So the maximum left is (n-1) - (l-1) = n-l.

So the code:

for l in range(1, n):

    for left in range(n - l +1):

        right = left + l -1

        current_sum = dp[left][right]

        if left >0:

            new_left = left -1

            new_right = right

            new_cost = current_sum + (s[right] - s[new_left])

            if new_cost < dp[new_left][new_right]:

                dp[new_left][new_right] = new_cost

        if right < n-1:

            new_left = left

            new_right = right +1

            new_cost = current_sum + (s[new_right] - s[left])

            if new_cost < dp[new_left][new_right]:

                dp[new_left][new_right] = new_cost

Wait, the loop for left is range(n - l +1). For example, when l is 1, n - l +1 is n-1+1 =n. So left ranges from 0 to n-1 (since in Python, range is exclusive). So for l=1, left runs from 0 to (n-1) (inclusive) and the right is left +0 = left. So it's all the intervals of length 1.

For l=2, left runs from 0 to n-2. right = left+1. So intervals of length 2.

Yes.

Testing the code with the first sample:

Sample Input 1:

3

3 1 2 → sorted to [1,2,3]

After sorting: s = [1,2,3]

Initialize dp as 3x3:

dp[0][0] =0, dp[1][1]=0, dp[2][2]=0. All others are infinity.

l=1:

Loop over left in 0 to 3-1+1=3. So left ranges from 0,1,2.

For left=0, right=0:

Expand to right (right+1=1):

new_cost = 0 + (s[1] - s[0]) → 2-1=1. So dp[0][1] =1.

For left=1, right=1:

Expand left to 0 → new_cost=0 + 2-1=1 → compare with dp[0][1] (current 1). So no change.

Expand to right → 2. new_cost=0 +3-2=1 → dp[1][2] =1.

For left=2, right=2:

Expand left to 1 → new_cost=0+3-2=1. dp[1][2] is 1. So no change.

Then l=2:

For left in 0 to 3-2+1=2 → left ranges 0,1.

For left=0, right=1:

current_sum=1.

Expand to left: invalid (left=0-1=-1).

Expand to right → right+1=2. new_cost=1 +3-1=2. So dp[0][2] becomes 3 (1+2).

For left=1, right=2:

current_sum=1.

Expand to left:0 → new_cost=1 +3-1=3. Compare with dp[0][2] which was infinity. So dp[0][2] becomes 3.

Expand to right: invalid.

So after l=2, the loop ends.

The answer is dp[0][2] =3, which matches the sample.

So the code seems correct.

Now, the code can be written in Python as follows.

But for handling large n (2000), using a 2D list may be memory intensive, but for 2000x2000 it's 4 million entries. Each being an integer. In Python, each integer is about 28 bytes (if using arbitrary precision), but that's not feasible. Wait, no. Wait, in Python, integers are stored as objects, so a list of lists will have pointers to integer objects, which is not feasible for 4 million entries. But for Python, using a 2D list with integers up to 1e18 is manageable, as long as the code is optimized.

But perhaps using a list of lists and initializing with a big number like INF = 1e18, which is manageable.

So the code:

Read n.

Read s as list, sort.

Initialize dp as 2D list of size n x n.

Then, loops as described.

Finally, print dp[0][n-1].

Testing against sample inputs 2, 3.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    import sys
    n = int(input_stream.readline())
    s = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().split()))
    s.sort()
    INF = float('inf')
    dp = [[INF] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 0
    for l in range(1, n):
        for left in range(n - l):
            right = left + l
            current = dp[left][right]
            if current == INF:
                continue
            # Expand to the left
            if left > 0:
                new_left = left - 1
                cost = current + (s[right] - s[new_left])
                if cost < dp[new_left][right]:
                    dp[new_left][right] = cost
            # Expand to the right
            if right < n - 1:
                new_right = right + 1
                cost = current + (s[new_right] - s[left])
                if cost < dp[left][new_right]:
                    dp[left][new_right] = cost
    print(dp[0][n-1], file=output_stream)
