Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So, the problem is about fighting monsters in order, and deciding when to use the secret technique to maximize the points. Let me think about how the process works.

So for each monster, the fight happens in turns: I hit first, then the opponent. But if the monster's HP drops to zero or below after my hit, I get a point. If the opponent's hit kills it, I don't get the point. The technique allows me to make the opponent skip their turn. But each use of this technique on a monster counts towards the total k allowed.

The goal is to decide for which monsters to use the technique (and how many times) to maximize the points.

Let's break down the steps for each monster. For a given monster's hp h_i, what's the scenario where using the technique helps me gain a point?

First, without any technique. Let's model how the monster's HP is reduced.

In each normal round (without using the technique), I hit first, then the opponent. So the total damage per full round is a + b. But the order matters for when the HP drops below zero.

Wait, the process is: I hit first. If after my hit, the monster is dead (h_i <= 0), then I get the point. Otherwise, the opponent hits. If the opponent's hit kills it, then no point.

But if the technique is used, then the opponent skips their turn. So in that case, after my hit, if the monster isn't dead, I can hit again if I use the technique again. Wait, no. Wait, the technique can be used multiple times per monster. Each time you use it during the fight for a monster, the opponent skips their turn once. So for each use of the technique on a monster, after my hit, the opponent doesn't hit. So the sequence would be: my hit, then maybe opponent's hit (if technique not used), then repeat until the monster is dead.

But each use of the technique on a monster allows me to take an extra hit (since the opponent's hit is skipped once). So for a monster, the number of times I can use the technique would affect how quickly I can kill it and get the point.

But the key is to determine for each monster whether using s techniques on it would allow me to gain the point. Then, among all monsters, select those that require the least number of techniques to gain the point, up to k total techniques.

So, the plan is to calculate for each monster the minimal number of techniques needed to turn it into a point, then collect as many of those as possible within k.

But how to compute for each monster whether it's possible to gain a point, and if so, how many techniques are needed.

Let's first calculate for each monster whether, without any techniques, I can get the point.

Case 1: The monster is killed in my first hit. Then, I get the point, no technique needed.

Case 2: The monster is killed after some rounds. Let's model this.

Let me think: the fight proceeds as my hit, then opponent's hit, unless I use the technique.

But in the normal scenario (without using the technique), for each full cycle (my hit plus opponent's hit), the monster's HP decreases by a + b. However, my hit comes first. So the order is important.

Let me model the number of hits required for the monster to die, considering the order.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate how much damage I can deal before the opponent's hits would take the monster's HP to zero or below.

Wait, let's think for each monster h_i. Let's first compute the number of techniques s_i needed to make sure that after my hits and possible skips of the opponent's hits, the monster dies on my hit.

For each monster, the goal is to find the minimal s_i such that using s_i techniques allows me to get the point.

The minimal s_i could be zero (if already I get the point without any techniques), or a positive integer. Then, among all monsters, we collect all the s_i values (for those where s_i is possible), sort them, and take as many as possible within k.

But how to compute s_i for each monster.

Let me think about the scenario where I use s techniques on the monster. Each technique allows me to skip the opponent's hit once. So during the fight, each technique use will allow me to have a sequence of my hits, and opponent's hits, but for s times, the opponent's hit is skipped.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model how the HP is reduced when using s techniques.

Each time I use a technique, after my hit, the opponent does not hit. So for each technique, the damage is a (my hit), and no opponent's hit. The other rounds are my hit followed by opponent's hit.

So for a monster, the total damage is:

Let’s denote:

The number of times I hit the monster without using a technique as x, and the number of times I use the technique as s. Each technique use gives me an extra hit (since the opponent's hit is skipped). Wait, no. Let me model this properly.

Wait, each technique use skips the opponent's hit once. So for each technique used, it's like a round where only I hit.

So, the total damage done is:

my hits: (x + s) * a

opponent's hits: x * b

Because in x rounds, both attack, and in s rounds, only I attack.

Wait, maybe not. Let's think step by step.

Suppose during the fight, there are x normal rounds (my hit then opponent's hit) and s rounds where after my hit, the opponent skips.

So the total damage is (x + s) * a (from my hits) plus x * b (from opponent's hits).

But the monster's HP must be reduced to <=0 after my hit in the (x + s)th hit.

Because the process is:

Each normal round: I hit, then opponent. If after my hit, monster is dead, then opponent's hit is not done.

But if I use a technique, after my hit, opponent skips. So, the process is:

In a normal round (without technique), I hit. If dead, done. Else, opponent hits.

In a technique round (using a technique), I hit. If dead, done. Else, proceed to next round (without the opponent hitting).

So for the monster to die on my hit, the total damage must be such that after my (x + s)th hit, the monster's HP is <=0. But in between, the opponent's hits happen only in the x normal rounds.

But this seems complicated. Perhaps there's a mathematical way to model this.

Let’s think: The monster's HP is h_i.

We want to find the minimal number of techniques s_i such that after (my hits and the opponent's hits), the monster's HP is <=0 after my hit, and before the opponent's hit in the same round.

Alternatively, after using s techniques, the total damage is such that:

sum_my_hits * a + sum_opponent_hits * b >= h_i

But sum_my_hits = x + s (since in x normal rounds, I hit x times, and in s techniques, I hit s times)

sum_opponent_hits = x (since in x normal rounds, the opponent hits x times, but in s techniques, they don't hit)

But the monster's HP must be reduced to <=0 after my hit in the (x + s)th hit.

But this is not straightforward. Let's model it step by step.

Alternatively, for a given monster h_i, what is the minimal s such that, when using s techniques, the monster dies on my hit.

Let me compute how much HP the monster has after each of my hits, and see if it's possible.

The total damage after my (m) hits and opponent's (x) hits would be m*a + x*b.

But during the process, m can be x + s (since in x normal rounds, I hit once each, and in s rounds where I use the technique, I hit once each. So total m = x + s.

But x is the number of normal rounds where both attack. So each normal round contributes (a + b) damage, and each technique round contributes a damage.

But the sequence is:

Hit 1 (me), then opponent hits (if not a technique round).

But the order is that I hit first. So, the process for a monster is:

While h_i > 0:

- I hit: h_i -= a. If h_i <=0, I gain a point. Break.

- If not, and if we don't use a technique in this round, opponent hits: h_i -= b. If h_i <=0, no point. Break.

- Else, if we use a technique, opponent skips.

But how to model the number of techniques needed to ensure that the monster dies on my hit.

Alternatively, the monster's HP after all my hits must be such that:

Each time I hit, if the remaining HP after my hit is <=0, I get the point.

Otherwise, if the technique is not used in that round, the opponent hits, possibly killing the monster (no point), or leaving it alive.

So the optimal way to use the technique is to make sure that in the rounds where, after my hit, the remaining HP would be >0, but the opponent's hit would kill it. So using the technique in those rounds would allow me to hit again, possibly killing the monster.

But this is getting a bit tangled. Let's think of it differently.

Suppose that, without using any techniques, we can compute whether the monster's death is caused by me or the opponent.

So for a monster h_i:

Let's compute the minimal number of my hits required to kill it, considering that after each hit, if the monster is dead, I get the point. Otherwise, the opponent hits (unless we use a technique).

But how?

Let me model it as follows.

Let’s imagine that for a monster, the optimal way to use s techniques is to use them in the rounds where, after my hit, the opponent's hit would kill the monster. So by using the technique, I prevent the opponent from killing the monster, allowing me to hit again.

But how to compute s for each monster.

Alternatively, let's model the scenario where we use s techniques on the monster. Then, the process would be:

Each technique allows me to hit, and the opponent does not hit. So, for each of s times, after my hit, there's no opponent hit.

In between the techniques, there are normal rounds where I hit, then opponent hits.

The total damage would be (my hits) * a + (opponent hits) * b.

But the monster's HP must be reduced to <=0 by my hit in one of the hits.

Let's think of the process as follows:

The fight proceeds in a sequence of rounds. Each round can be either:

- A normal round: I hit, then opponent hits (if monster not dead).

- A technique round: I hit, then no opponent hit.

But the order of these rounds depends on how we use the techniques.

The optimal way to use the techniques would be to use them in the rounds where the opponent's hit would have killed the monster. So, by using a technique, we prevent the opponent from killing the monster, allowing us to hit again.

So, for each monster, the minimal s is the number of times the opponent's hit would kill the monster, and we need to prevent that by using the technique.

But how to compute this?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows:

For a monster, the maximum possible points we can get is 1 if we can arrange to kill it with our hit. Otherwise, it's 0.

The question is, for each monster, can we use some s_i techniques to turn a 0 into a 1. And then select the monsters with the smallest s_i to use as many as possible within k.

So first, for each monster, compute whether we can get a point without using any techniques (s_i=0). If yes, then that's a free point. Then, for the remaining monsters, compute the minimal s_i required to turn it into a point. Then, collect those s_i, sort them, and take as many as possible within the remaining k.

So the problem reduces to:

1. For each monster, determine if it's already a point (s_i=0). Count those.

2. For the others, compute the minimal s_i needed to make it a point. Then select the monsters with the smallest s_i, up to k, and add them to the total.

The total maximum points is the initial count plus the number of s_i's that can be covered with the remaining k.

So the steps are:

- For each monster, compute whether s_i=0 (i.e., can get the point without using any techniques). Let’s call this base_points.

- For the monsters not in base_points, compute the minimal s_i required. For those, sort the s_i in ascending order and pick as many as possible with sum s_i <=k. The number of such is the additional points.

- The total is base_points + additional_points.

So, the key is to compute for each monster whether s_i is 0 (if possible), and if not, compute the minimal s_i required.

Now, how to compute whether s_i is 0, i.e., without using any techniques, does the monster die on my hit?

Let me model that.

Without any techniques, the process is:

Each round is my hit followed by opponent's hit.

But the fight stops as soon as the monster's HP drops to <=0.

So, for the monster to die on my hit, there must be a certain number of my hits m such that:

a * m + b * (m-1) < h_i <= a * m + b * (m-1) + a

Wait, perhaps not. Let's see:

The first hit is me: h_i -=a. If it's dead, done.

If not, opponent hits: h_i -=b. If dead, no point.

If not, next round: me again.

So, the sequence of hits is:

Hit 1 (me): h_i -=a → check if dead.

If not, hit 2 (opponent): h_i -=b → check if dead.

If not, hit 3 (me): h_i -=a → check if dead.

And so on.

So, for the monster to die on my hit (without any techniques), the total damage after m my hits and (m-1) opponent hits must be >= h_i, but the total after (m-1) my hits and (m-1) opponent hits must be < h_i.

Wait:

After m my hits and (m-1) opponent hits, the monster's HP is h_i - (m*a + (m-1)*b).

But the m-th my hit is the killing hit. So after the (m-1)th opponent hit, the monster's HP is >0, then my m-th hit reduces it to <=0.

So:

h_i - ( (m-1)*a + (m-1)*b ) > 0 → h_i > (m-1)(a + b)

After my m-th hit: h_i - ( m*a + (m-1)*b ) <=0 → h_i <= m*a + (m-1)*b.

So, solving for m.

Let me compute m as the minimal integer such that (m-1)*(a + b) < h_i <= m*a + (m-1)*b.

If such m exists, then the monster can be killed by me without using any techniques. So s_i=0.

Otherwise, the opponent's hit would kill the monster, so s_i>0.

So how to compute whether such an m exists.

Alternatively, for the initial case (s=0), we can compute whether after m hits by me and (m-1) by the opponent, the monster is dead.

Let’s think in terms of m: the number of my hits needed to kill the monster, given that the opponent hits (m-1) times.

So:

m is the minimal integer where:

h_i <= m*a + (m-1)*b → h_i <= a*m + b*(m-1)

But also, after (m-1) my hits and (m-1) opponent hits, the monster's HP is still positive:

h_i > (m-1)*a + (m-1)*b → h_i > (a + b)*(m-1)

So combining:

(a + b)*(m-1) < h_i <= a*m + b*(m-1) = (a + b)*(m-1) + a → h_i <= (a + b)*(m-1) + a.

So, h_i must be in the interval ( (a + b)*(m-1), (a + b)*(m-1) + a ]

If such m exists, then s_i=0.

So, first, we can check if the monster's h_i is in any of these intervals for some m. If yes, then the monster can be killed by me without using any techniques.

Otherwise, we need to use some techniques.

So for each monster, first check if it's in such an interval. If yes, then s_i=0, and it's part of the base points.

Otherwise, we need to compute the minimal s_i required.

Now, how to compute the minimal s_i for the other monsters.

For those monsters where s_i>0, we need to find the minimal s such that after using s techniques, the monster's death is on my hit.

How?

Let’s model this. Using s techniques allows us to have s rounds where the opponent skips their hit.

In these scenarios, the damage sequence is: me hit s times (each followed by no opponent hit), and me hit m times in normal rounds (each followed by an opponent hit).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the total damage needed, considering that in s of the rounds, the opponent does not hit.

So, the total damage is:

me hits: x + s → each hit contributes a.

opponent hits: x → each hit contributes b.

So, the total damage is a*(x + s) + b*x >= h_i.

But the monster must die on my hit, which implies that:

After (x + s) hits by me, the monster's HP is <=0.

But after x + s - 1 hits by me, and x hits by the opponent, the HP is still positive.

Wait, maybe that's not the correct way. Let's think again.

When using s techniques, the fight proceeds with some normal rounds and some technique rounds.

Each normal round: me hit, then opponent hit (if not dead).

Each technique round: me hit, and opponent skips (if not dead).

The sequence can be any combination of these rounds, but the order may vary. However, the optimal strategy is to arrange the techniques in such a way as to minimize s.

But figuring out the minimal s is tricky.

Alternatively, we can model this as follows: when using s techniques, the minimal number of hits I need to land so that after the s-th technique, the monster is dead.

But this is vague.

Alternatively, let's think of the monster's HP after all possible hits. To have the monster die on my hit, the following must hold:

sum_my_hits * a + sum_opponent_hits * b >= h_i.

sum_my_hits = x + s.

sum_opponent_hits = x.

But also, after each of my hits (except possibly the last one), the monster's HP is still positive. But this complicates things.

Alternatively, the minimal s can be computed by considering the remaining HP after the normal process (without any techniques) and seeing how many extra hits I need to land to kill it.

Wait, perhaps for a monster where the opponent would kill it, the required s is the number of times I can hit the monster to reduce the remaining HP to zero, considering that each such hit is possible by using a technique.

Let me think: Suppose that in the normal process (without techniques), the opponent's hit would kill the monster. So the monster's HP after my (m-1) hits and (m-1) opponent hits is:

h_i' = h_i - ( (m-1)a + (m-1)b )

Then, in the next round, I hit for a, making h_i' - a. If this is <=0, then I get the point. Otherwise, the opponent hits, and kills it (no point).

But in this case, the opponent's hit would kill it. So to prevent that, I can use a technique here. So, after my hit, the opponent's hit is skipped. So, if after my hit, the HP is still positive, I can hit again (using another technique) until it's dead.

Wait, but in this scenario, the initial m-1 hits by me and m-1 hits by the opponent, then I hit (m-th hit). If after that, the HP is still positive, opponent would hit again. So using a technique here would skip the opponent's hit and allow me to hit again.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, after the normal process, where the monster would die on the opponent's hit, we can compute how much more damage I need to do, which would require additional hits (each requiring a technique to skip the opponent's hit).

So, the remaining HP after the normal process (where the opponent's hit kills it) is h_i' = h_i - (m*a + (m-1)*b).

Wait, no. Wait, in the normal process, the monster dies on the opponent's hit. So during the m-th round:

I hit, bringing the HP to h_i - ( (m-1)*a + (m-1)*b + a ) = h_i - ( m*a + (m-1)*b )

If this is still positive, then opponent hits with b, bringing it to h_i - ( m*a + (m-1)*b ) -b = h_i - m*a - m*b. Since this is <=0 (because the opponent's hit kills it), but no point for me.

So, the HP after my m hits and opponent's m hits is h_i - (m*(a + b)) <=0. But this scenario is when the opponent's hit kills the monster.

In this case, using s techniques would allow me to hit s times in between, each time preventing the opponent's hit.

So, the total damage would be m*a + (m - s)*b + s*a = a*(m + s) + b*(m - s). But wait, perhaps this is not the right way. Let me re-express.

Alternatively, suppose that in the scenario where the opponent's hit would kill the monster, we can model how much HP remains after my m hits and opponent's (m-1) hits, and then use s techniques to apply my hits.

Wait, perhaps an example would help.

Take the sample input 2:

1 1 100 99

100

So a=1, b=100, h=100.

In the normal process:

First hit by me: HP becomes 99. Not dead. Opponent hits 100: HP becomes -1. No point. So without using techniques, I get 0 points.

But if I use 99 techniques, how?

Each technique allows me to hit again. Let's see:

First hit: 100-1=99. Then, using a technique (s=1), opponent skips. Then, I hit again: 99-1=98. s=2. Opponent skips. And so on. After 99 techniques, I hit 99 times, each time with a technique. The total damage is 99*1=99. But 100-99=1>0. Then, the 100th hit (using the 99th technique) would bring it to 100-100=0. So yes, I get the point. Wait, but 99 techniques? Wait, the sample input allows k=99, and the output is 1. So this requires s=99.

So for this case, the minimal s_i is 99.

Hmm. So the calculation here is that, after the first hit by me (h=99), the opponent would hit with 100, which would kill it. So, to prevent that, I must use a technique. Then, I hit again (h=98), and again use a technique. So on, until the 99th hit (after 99 techniques), h=1. Then, the next hit (100th?) But how?

Wait, maybe for this case, the minimal s is (h_i - 1) // a → (100-1)/1 =99. So s=99.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, after the first hit, the opponent's hit would kill the monster, but using a technique allows me to hit again.

Each technique allows me to hit once more.

So the required s is the number of times I need to hit the monster after the initial hit to bring it to zero.

But how?

The initial hit (my hit) does a damage of 1. Then, each technique allows me to hit again (without the opponent's hit).

So the total damage required is h_i.

But the damage is a * (1 + s) >= h_i.

So s >= (h_i //a ) - 1, but if h_i %a !=0, then (h_i -1) //a ?

Wait, in the sample input 2, h_i=100, a=1. So 1 + s*1 >=100 → s >=99. So 99 techniques.

Which matches the sample.

So this suggests that for a monster that is not in the base points (s_i=0), the required s_i is ceil( (h_i - (a * m + b*(m-1)) ) / a ), where m is the number of my hits in the normal scenario. Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, let's model this.

For a monster that would be killed by the opponent's hit (so not in base points), we need to compute how many techniques are needed to allow me to hit enough times to kill it.

In the normal scenario (without techniques), the monster is killed by the opponent's hit. So, the opponent's hit is the one that brings the HP down to zero.

In this case, the HP after my hit (but before the opponent's hit) is h_i - (m*a + (m-1)*b) = D. Then, the opponent's hit would do D - b <=0 → D <=b.

But D is positive because otherwise, my hit would have killed the monster.

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe we can find a formula for s_i.

Alternatively, the minimal number of techniques needed is ceil( (h_i % (a + b) - a) / a ) if h_i % (a + b) is in a certain range.

Wait, let's consider that after the initial attacks, the monster's HP is reduced by (a + b) per round. Then, in the final round, my hit comes first. If the remaining HP is in (0, a], then I kill it. If in (a, a + b], then the opponent kills it.

But if I can use techniques, then each technique allows me to hit once more, avoiding the opponent's hit.

So for those monsters where the remaining HP after all full rounds is in (a, a + b], then I need to use techniques to hit the remaining HP.

For example, if the remaining HP is R. Then R is in (a, a + b].

The opponent would hit after me, killing it, so I need to use techniques to hit R with my hits.

The number of my hits needed is ceil( (R - a) / a ), but since each hit is a.

Wait, R is the remaining HP after m full rounds (each a + b), where m is the maximum possible such that (a + b)*m < h_i.

So:

m = (h_i -1) // (a + b)

remaining R = h_i - m*(a + b)

Now, if R <=a → then I can kill it in the next hit (without techniques). So s_i=0.

If R >a and R <=a + b → then in the normal scenario, the opponent's hit kills it (s_i=0 is not possible). So to get the point, I need to use techniques to hit the remaining R.

Each technique allows me to hit once, and the opponent doesn't hit. So I can hit as many times as needed until R <=0.

So the minimal number of techniques is ceil( (R - a) / a ) → because after the first hit (in the next round), I hit for a. R - a is the remaining HP. But if that's still positive, I need to hit again (using another technique). So s_i = ceil( (R - a) / a )

Wait, but after the first hit (a damage), the remaining is R -a. If that's still positive, then another hit (with a technique) is needed. So the total techniques needed is ceil( (R - a) / a ). But wait, let's test with sample input 2.

Sample input 2: h_i=100, a=1, b=100.

m = (100 -1) // (1 + 100) → 99//101 =0. So m=0.

R=100 -0 =100.

R is 100. Which is >a (1) and <=a +b (101). So R is in (a, a +b].

So s_i = ceil( (100 -1) /1 ) =99. Which matches the sample.

Another example: h_i=7, a=2, b=3.

In sample input 1, the first monster has h=7.

Compute m = (7-1)/(2+3) =6//5=1. So m=1. R=7 -1*(5) =2. R is 2 <=a=2 → so s_i=0. So this monster can be killed without techniques.

So that's why in sample input 1, the first monster contributes to base_points.

Another example: let's say h_i=10, a=2, b=3. Then m=(10-1)/5=9//5=1. R=10-5=5. 5>2, but <=5 (a + b=5). So s_i=ceil( (5-2)/2 )= ceil(3/2)=2. So s_i=2.

But wait, let's see. R=5. So in the normal scenario, I hit 2, making R=3. Opponent hits 3, making it 0. No point. So to prevent that, I need to use techniques.

So after my first hit (2 damage), R is 3. Then, using a technique allows me to hit again. So, next hit 2, R=1. Using another technique, hit again 2, R=-1. So two techniques are needed. Which matches the calculation.

So the formula for s_i is:

For monsters where R = h_i % (a + b), but only when R is in (a, a + b]:

If R is in this range, then s_i = ceil( (R -a) / a )

Wait, but R is h_i - m*(a +b), where m is the maximum integer where m*(a +b) <h_i.

But m = (h_i -1) // (a +b)

So R = h_i - m*(a +b)

If R <=a → s_i=0 (can kill without techniques).

Else (R >a and R <= a +b → need to use s_i=ceil( (R -a)/a )

But wait, why (R -a)/a? Because each technique allows me to hit once. So after the first hit (a damage), the remaining is R -a. If R -a is positive, I need another hit (another technique) to deal a damage, etc.

So the number of hits required is ceil( (R) /a ), but since the first hit is part of the normal process.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

The total required damage after m*(a +b) is R. So, to kill it with my hits:

R must be <= s_i * a.

But since each technique allows an extra hit (without opponent's hit), s_i is the minimal number of techniques such that s_i * a >= R - a.

Wait, because after the normal process, we are in a scenario where the next hit is mine (so R is the remaining HP after m*(a +b) steps). Wait, no. Wait, m*(a +b) is the damage after m full rounds (my hit and opponent's hit). Then, the next hit is mine. So R = h_i - m*(a +b). So if R <=a: my hit kills it. Else, the opponent's hit kills it.

So, in the case where R >a, then after my hit (a damage), R becomes R -a. If this is positive, opponent hits for b, but that would kill it (since R -a -b <=0), but no point. So to prevent that, I need to use techniques to hit s_i times.

So, the required damage is R -a. Because after the first hit (a damage), the remaining is R -a, which must be <=0 to have my hit kill it. Otherwise, the opponent's hit would occur.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

In the normal scenario:

After m full rounds (my hit and opponent's hit), the total damage is m*(a +b). The remaining HP is h_i - m*(a +b) = R.

Then, the next hit is mine: R -=a. If this is <=0 → I get the point. Else, opponent hits R -=b. If this <=0 → no point.

But if R -a >0 → then I need to use techniques.

So, to get the point, after my first hit (R -a), the monster must be dead. If it's still alive, then opponent hits and kills it (no point). So to prevent that, I need to use techniques to hit again.

So, the required total damage after my first hit (which is part of the normal process) is s_i more hits of a each.

So, total damage after first hit (a) plus s_i *a >= R → R -a <= s_i *a → s_i >= ceil( (R -a) /a )

But R is h_i - m*(a +b)

So, s_i = ceil( (R -a) /a )

But R must be >a for this scenario to happen.

So, the formula is:

For a monster:

Compute m = (h_i -1) // (a + b)

R = h_i - m*(a +b)

If R <=a: s_i=0

Else:

s_i = ceil( (R -a) /a )

But since R can be up to a +b:

R can be a+1 to a +b. But after my hit (a), R becomes R -a. Which is 1 to b.

But the opponent's hit (b) would kill it. So to prevent that, we need to use s_i techniques to hit enough times to reduce R -a - s_i *a <=0.

Wait, maybe:

After my first hit (R -a), the opponent would hit, making it R -a -b. But if that's <=0, then opponent's hit kills it, no point.

So, if R -a <=0 → s_i=0.

Else, we need to use s_i techniques, each allowing us to hit once, to kill the monster.

But each technique allows us to hit once, but without the opponent hitting.

So, after the first hit (R -a), we need to hit s_i times with a, so that:

(R -a) - s_i *a <=0 → s_i >= ceil( (R -a) /a )

But since s_i must be >=0.

So, s_i is the minimal number of techniques needed to make this possible.

For example:

h_i=10, a=2, b=3.

m = (10-1)/(5) =1.8 → 1. So m=1. R=10-5*1=5.

R=5 >a=2.

s_i=ceil( (5-2)/2 )=ceil(3/2)=2.

Which requires hitting twice, each time using a technique. So total damage after first hit:5-2=3. Then two hits of 2 each:3-2*2= -1. So two techniques needed.

Which works.

Another example: h_i=12, a=2, b=3.

m=(12-1)/5=11//5=2. m=2. R=12-5*2=2. R=2 <=a=2. So s_i=0.

So, after 2 rounds (my hit and opponent's hit each time), total damage 10. R=2. Next hit by me: 2-2=0. I get the point.

Another example: h_i=8, a=2, b=3. m=(8-1)/5=1.4 →1. R=8-5=3. R=3>2. s_i=ceil( (3-2)/2 )=ceil(1/2)=1. So one technique.

After first hit:3-2=1. Then using a technique, hit again 2, total 1-2= -1. So one technique.

Which is correct.

So, the formula seems to hold.

So, the steps to compute s_i for each monster are:

Compute m = (h_i -1) // (a + b)

R = h_i - m*(a +b)

if R <=a: s_i=0 (add to base points)

else: s_i = ceil( (R -a)/a )

But if R is not in (a, a +b], then this scenario wouldn't occur. So, this formula applies when R is in (a, a +b], which is the case when the monster is killed by the opponent's hit.

Thus, the minimal s_i for each monster is as calculated.

Now, the problem reduces to:

1. For each monster, compute s_i as per the formula.

2. Separate the monsters into those with s_i=0 (base_points) and those with s_i>0 (possible candidates).

3. For the candidates, collect their s_i values.

4. Sort these s_i values in ascending order.

5. Take as many as possible from the sorted list, up to a sum not exceeding k.

The total points are base_points + the number of s_i's taken.

So, the code would need to:

Read n, a, b, k.

Read the h_i list.

For each h in h_i:

compute m = (h-1) // (a + b)

R = h - m*(a +b)

if R <=a:

   base +=1

else:

   required_s = ceil( (R -a) /a )

   append required_s to a list.

sort the list.

sum the required_s in order until sum exceeds k.

count the number of such elements.

sum base + count.

But how to compute ceil( (R -a)/a ) ?

In Python, ceil can be computed as (x + y -1) // y.

So for (R -a) divided by a:

required_s = ( (R -a) + a -1 ) //a = (R -1) //a

Because (R -a) + a-1 = R -1.

So, required_s = (R-1) //a.

Let's test this:

For sample input 2, R=100.

required_s = (100-1) //1 =99 → correct.

Another example, R=5-2=3, a=2 → (3-1)/2=2/2=1 → ceil(3/2)=2? Wait wait, no.

Wait, in the example where R=5, a=2:

required_s = ceil( (5-2)/2 ) → ceil(3/2) =2.

But according to (R-1)//a → (5-1)//2=4//2=2. Which gives 2.

Yes.

Another example: R=3, a=2 → (3-1)/2 =1 → required_s=1. Which is correct.

Yes, this formula works.

So, the required_s is (R-1) //a.

So, code can be written as:

required_s = (R-1) // a

But what if a is zero? But according to the problem constraints, a >=1.

So, the code for each h_i is:

s = (h_i -1) // (a + b)

R = h_i - s * (a + b)

if R <=a:

   base +=1

else:

   required_s = (R-1) //a

   if required_s <=k: possible to take this.

   append required_s to the list.

So, after collecting all required_s, sort them and accumulate as many as possible without exceeding k.

Now, considering the constraints:

n can be up to 2e5, which is manageable. Sorting 2e5 elements is O(n log n), which is acceptable for 1 second.

But what about the case where a +b is very large, and m is zero?

But the code handles that.

Now, edge cases:

- a=0: but according to constraints, a is at least 1.

- a=0 is impossible.

Another edge case: when a +b is 0. But a and b are at least 1, so a +b >=2.

So, code is correct.

Now, let's test the sample inputs.

Sample input 1:

6 2 3 3

7 10 50 12 1 8

So, a=2, b=3, a +b=5.

h = [7,10,50,12,1,8]

For each h:

h=7:

m=(7-1)//5=6//5=1 → m=1. R=7 -5*1=2. R=2 <=a=2 → s_i=0. base +=1.

h=10:

m=(10-1)//5=9//5=1. R=10-5=5. R=5>2. required_s= (5-1)/2=4//2=2. So s_i=2.

h=50:

m=(50-1)/5=49//5=9. R=50-5*9=50-45=5. R=5>2. required_s=(5-1)/2=2. So s_i=2.

h=12:

m=(12-1)/5=11//5=2. R=12-5*2=2. <=2 → s_i=0. base +=1.

h=1:

m=(1-1)/5=0. R=1. <=2 → s_i=0. base +=1.

h=8:

m=(8-1)/5=7//5=1. R=8-5*1=3. 3>2 → required_s= (3-1)/2=1. So s_i=1.

So the list of required_s is [2,2,1].

Sorted list: [1,2,2].

k=3.

summing:

1 (sum=3 >=1 → take. sum_so_far=1, count=1.

then 2 (sum+2=3 → total 3. count=2.

then next 2: sum+2=5>3. So total count is 2.

base is 3 (from h=7,12,1).

Total points:3+2=5. Which matches the sample.

Another sample input 2:

1 1 100 99

h=100.

a=1, b=100. a +b=101.

m=(100-1)/101=99//101=0.

R=100.

R=100>1.

required_s= (100-1)/1=99.

k=99. So take it. base is 0. total is 1.

Sample input 3:

7 4 2 1

h:1,3,5,4,2,7,6

a=4, b=2. a +b=6.

Check each h:

h=1:

m=(1-1)/6=0. R=1. R<=4 → s_i=0. base +=1.

h=3: m=(3-1)/6=0. R=3 <=4 → s_i=0. base +=1.

h=5: m=(5-1)/6=4//6=0. R=5>4. required_s=(5-1)/4=4//4=1 → s_i=1.

h=4: R=4 <=4 → s_i=0. base +=1.

h=2: R=2 <=4 → s_i=0. base +=1.

h=7: m=(7-1)/6=1 → R=7-6=1. 1<=4 → s_i=0. base +=1.

h=6: m=(6-1)/6=5//6=0. R=6>4. required_s= (6-1)/4=5//4=1. s_i=1.

So the required_s list is [1,1].

k=1.

So sorted list is [1,1]. Take one. So total points: base is 5 (from h=1,3,4,2,7) +1=6.

Which matches sample 3.

So the code works.

Now, code.

We need to:

- Read n, a, b, k.

- Read list h.

- For each h in h:

   compute m = (h-1) // (a +b)

   R = h - m*(a +b)

   if R <=a: add to base.

   else: compute required_s = (R-1) //a. add to list.

- sort the list.

- accumulate the sum of required_s in sorted order until sum exceeds k.

- count how many can be taken.

- total is base + count.

Now, code.

Edge Cases:

- When a +b is 0: but since a and b >=1, this is impossible.

- when a is very large.

But code handles this.

Now, code in Python.

But note that in Python, integer division with // is floor division.

But (h-1) // (a +b) is correct.

So code:

Read n, a, b, k from input.

h = list of integers.

base =0

lst = []

sum_ab = a + b

for hi in h:

    m = (hi -1) // sum_ab

    R = hi - m * sum_ab

    if R <=a:

        base +=1

    else:

        required_s = (R -1) // a

        lst.append(required_s)

lst.sort()

res =0

current_sum=0

for s in lst:

    if current_sum + s <=k:

        current_sum +=s

        res +=1

    else:

        break

print(base + res)

Yes.
