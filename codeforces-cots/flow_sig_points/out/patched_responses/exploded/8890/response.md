Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the problem is about moving pawns on a chessboard based on the directions in each cell, and we need to find the maximum sum of moves each pawn can make before they stop moving (either because they loop or hit a blocked cell). But if there's a possibility of infinite movement, we return -1.

Hmm. The key points here are:

1. Each pawn moves according to the direction on their current cell. So each step, both pawns move simultaneously. If either pawn is on a '#' cell, it doesn't move.
2. The pawns can be placed on any two cells except that they can only be on the same cell if that cell is blocked (i.e., both are on a '#' cell).
3. The goal is to maximize the sum of the number of moves each pawn makes before they can't move anymore. If any pawn is part of a cycle that allows infinite movement, then the answer is -1.

So first, I need to model the movement of each pawn. For each cell (i,j), when a pawn is there, it will move in a certain direction until it either enters a cycle, reaches a blocked cell, or enters a cell that leads to a loop.

But how do we track the movement of the pawns? Since the pawns move simultaneously, but their paths are independent except for their starting positions.

Wait, the problem states that the pawns are placed optimally. So Ksenia can choose any two starting positions (possibly the same if it's a blocked cell) such that the sum of their steps is maximized, but if any of the pawns can move infinitely, the answer is -1.

So first, for each cell, we need to determine the maximum number of steps a pawn starting there can take before it stops (either by entering a loop or hitting a blocked cell). Then, the problem reduces to selecting two cells (possibly same if blocked) such that the sum of their steps is maximum, but if any of them is part of an infinite cycle, then the answer is -1.

Wait, but if either pawn can move infinitely, then the sum would be infinite. So the answer is -1 if there exists any pair of starting cells where at least one of them can move infinitely. Because even if one pawn can move infinitely, then the sum is infinite. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the game ends when the pawns can't move anymore. Wait, how does the movement work?

The movement steps are as follows: each move, each pawn (that is not on a '#') is moved according to their current cell's direction. So if a pawn is on a cell that leads it into a cycle, then it will loop forever, moving each step. But in that case, the game would never end, so the score would be infinite. Therefore, if any pawn can enter an infinite loop (i.e., a cycle), then the answer is -1. Because Ksenia can choose to place that pawn (and the other in some position that doesn't interfere) and get infinite points.

Wait, but according to the problem statement: "the game begins when Ksenia put pawns on the board. In one move, Ksenia moves each pawn to a side adjacent cell in the direction of arrows painted on the cell on which the corresponding pawn sits (if the pawn sits on "#", it does not move). Assume that Ksenia moves pawns simultaneously."

So the pawns are moving step by step. Each step, both move. The game ends when both pawns can no longer move. Wait, no. The game continues until both pawns are on blocked cells. Because each step, each pawn that is not on a '#' moves. So, for example, if pawn A is moving in a cycle and pawn B is on a '#' cell, then pawn A will continue moving infinitely, and the game's score will keep increasing. So in that case, the sum is infinite, so the output is -1.

Wait, the score is the sum of the number of moves each pawn made. So each move, both pawns are moved. For each move, the pawns can contribute 1 each if they move, or 0 if they are on a '#'.

Wait no. Let me re-read the problem statement:

"count how many movements the first pawn made and how many movements the second pawn made, sum these two numbers â€” it will be the resulting score of the game."

So each move, the pawns are moved once. Each pawn's movement count is incremented by 1 if they moved during that step (i.e., if they were not on a '#' before moving). So even if a pawn is moved into a '#', that's their last movement.

Wait, no. Let's clarify:

In each move (step), each pawn is moved according to their current cell. So for a pawn that is on a cell that's not '#', it moves to the next cell according to the arrow. If the next cell is '#', then after moving into it, the pawn is now on a '#', so in the next step, it won't move again.

So the movement counts for each pawn are the number of steps in which they were moved. For example:

Pawn A starts on cell X (not blocked). It moves for 3 steps, then steps onto a '#'. So it made 3 moves. Pawn B starts on a '#', so it never moves. The sum is 3 + 0 = 3.

If a pawn enters a cycle, then it will keep moving forever. So in that case, the sum is infinite, so the answer is -1.

Therefore, the problem reduces to:

We need to check all possible pairs of starting positions (s1, s2) where s1 and s2 can be the same only if they are blocked. For each pair, compute the sum of the number of steps each pawn takes until they stop moving. But if either pawn's movement is infinite, then the answer is -1.

But considering all possible pairs is O((n*m)^2), which for 2000x2000 grids would be 4e10 operations, which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.

So first, for each cell, we need to compute two things:

1. The number of steps a pawn starting at that cell can move before it stops (either by entering a cycle or by reaching a '#').

2. Whether that cell is part of a cycle (i.e., whether the movement from that cell leads to an infinite loop).

If any cell is part of a cycle, then placing a pawn there will result in infinite steps. So if there exists even one such cell, then Ksenia can choose to place that pawn (and another pawn in a cell that has finite steps, or even the same cell if it's blocked), leading to an infinite sum. Therefore, the answer is -1 in that case.

Wait, no. Wait, if a cell is part of a cycle, then the pawn starting there will loop forever. So every step, that pawn is moving. So the sum would be infinite. So the answer would be -1 if there's any cell that is part of a cycle. Because Ksenia can choose to place one pawn on that cell, and the other anywhere (as long as it's allowed). So even if one pawn can loop infinitely, the sum is infinite. So the first thing we need to do is check if there exists any cell that is part of a cycle. If yes, output -1.

But wait, maybe the movement from a cell leads to a cycle but the cell itself is not part of the cycle. For example, a cell that leads into a cycle after some steps. For example, if a cell's path is a chain leading to a cycle. Then, a pawn starting at that cell will have a finite number of steps (the steps until it enters the cycle, then infinite steps in the cycle). So the pawn would have infinite steps, leading to the answer being -1.

So, any cell that is in a cycle, or that eventually leads into a cycle, will result in the pawn moving infinitely. Therefore, for any cell, if the path starting from it never ends (i.e., eventually enters a cycle and loops forever), then the sum will be infinite. Therefore, if any cell has such a path, the answer is -1.

Therefore, the first thing to check is: does any cell (other than blocked cells) have a path that never reaches a blocked cell (i.e., enters a cycle and loops forever)?

If yes, then the answer is -1.

Only if all cells (non-blocked) eventually reach a blocked cell can the maximum sum be finite. So first, check if the entire grid is such that all paths eventually terminate in a blocked cell. If there exists a cell that does not terminate (i.e., loops infinitely), then output -1.

Otherwise, compute for each cell the number of steps it takes to reach a blocked cell (possibly zero if the cell is blocked), and then find the maximum sum of any two cells (s1, s2) where s1 and s2 can be same only if they are blocked.

So the steps are:

1. For each cell, determine if it leads to an infinite loop (i.e., path never ends). If any such cell exists, output -1.

2. Else, for each cell, compute the length of the path until it reaches a blocked cell (steps taken), and then find the two cells (possibly the same if blocked) whose step counts sum to the maximum.

But how to check if a cell's path is infinite? Well, a path that is infinite implies that it eventually enters a cycle. So for each cell, when you traverse according to the arrows, you will either reach a blocked cell, or enter a cycle.

So the steps to compute for each cell:

- For each cell (i,j), if it's blocked, then the steps are 0.

- Else, perform a traversal until either a blocked cell is reached, or a cycle is detected.

But for a grid of 2000x2000, doing this naively for each cell would be O(nm) steps per cell, leading to O(n^2m^2) time, which is 16e8 operations for 2000x2000, which is way too slow.

We need a way to compute this efficiently.

This is similar to finding for each cell the number of steps until it reaches a blocked cell, and also detect if it's part of a cycle.

An efficient way to do this is to model the movement as a directed graph where each node is a cell, and there's an edge from (i,j) to the next cell according to the arrow. Then, for each cell, the path is a chain of nodes. Since each node has exactly one outgoing edge (because each cell's direction determines exactly where you go next), this graph is a collection of chains and cycles. If a chain leads to a cycle, then all nodes in the chain and cycle are part of infinite loops (since once you enter the cycle, you loop forever). If the chain leads to a blocked cell, then all nodes in the chain have a finite path length.

Therefore, the problem reduces to:

- For each cell, check if it's part of a cycle. If any cell (non-blocked) is in a cycle, then output -1.

- Otherwise, for each cell, the path length is the number of steps until it reaches a blocked cell. Then, find the maximum sum of two such path lengths.

Wait, but even if the cell is not part of a cycle, but its path leads to a cycle, that would also cause infinite steps. Wait no. Because if a cell's path leads to a cycle, then the pawn would enter the cycle and loop forever. So in that case, the answer is -1.

Therefore, the first step is to check for any cycles in the directed graph formed by the cells (ignoring blocked cells). Because if any cell (non-blocked) is part of a cycle, then the path is infinite, leading to the answer being -1.

But how to detect cycles in this graph?

Since each node has exactly one outgoing edge (the next cell according to the direction), the graph is a collection of cycles and trees directed towards cycles (i.e., each component is either a cycle, or a tree where each path eventually leads to a cycle, or a tree where each path leads to a blocked cell). Wait, no. For example, if a cell's path leads to a blocked cell, then that's a terminal node (since the next step would not be taken). So the graph can have nodes that point to blocked cells. So the directed graph can have chains leading to blocked cells, or cycles.

So, the presence of any cycle (of non-blocked cells) implies that there exists a cell (those in the cycle) that will loop infinitely, hence the answer is -1.

Therefore, the first step is to check if there are any cycles in the graph of non-blocked cells. If there are, output -1.

Otherwise, for each non-blocked cell, compute the path length until it reaches a blocked cell. Then, the answer is the maximum sum of two such path lengths (with the possibility of the same cell being chosen if it's blocked).

Wait, but blocked cells have a path length of 0. So the maximum sum would be the sum of the two largest path lengths, except when one or both of the cells are blocked. For example, if a blocked cell is chosen as a starting position, the pawn doesn't move. So for a blocked cell, the steps are zero. So the maximum sum would be the sum of the two largest steps from non-blocked cells.

But the pawns can be placed on any two cells (even non-blocked ones) as long as they are different. Wait, no. The problem says: "One cell of the chessboard can contain two pawns if and only if the cell is blocked. In other cases two pawns can not stand in one cell."

So the two pawns can start in the same cell only if that cell is blocked. Otherwise, they must start in different cells.

Therefore, when selecting two starting cells (s1, s2):

- If s1 is blocked and s2 is blocked, then both have steps zero. Sum is zero.

- If s1 is blocked and s2 is non-blocked, then sum is steps of s2.

- If s1 and s2 are different non-blocked cells, then sum is steps(s1) + steps(s2).

So the maximum sum is the maximum of:

- The maximum steps of any single non-blocked cell (if allowed to place one pawn on a non-blocked and the other on a blocked).

- The sum of the top two steps from different non-blocked cells.

So first, after ensuring there are no cycles, we can compute for each cell (non-blocked) its steps. Then, find the two largest steps (could be same cell if they are the same, but since they need to be different cells, perhaps not). Wait, no. Because when you select two different cells, their steps are added. So the maximum sum is the sum of the two largest steps (if they are in different cells). If there's only one non-blocked cell, then the maximum sum would be steps of that cell (if paired with a blocked cell). But if there are two cells with steps 5 and 4, sum is 9.

But also, consider that a blocked cell can be chosen as one of the pawns. For example, if there is a cell with steps 10 and another with steps 0 (blocked), then sum is 10. So the maximum sum would be between the sum of top two steps (if both are non-blocked) or the top step (if paired with a blocked cell).

So the steps for the solution are:

1. Check if there exists any cycle in the directed graph formed by non-blocked cells. If yes, output -1.

2. Else, for each non-blocked cell, compute the number of steps until it reaches a blocked cell.

3. Find the maximum sum possible by choosing two pawns.

So, how to check for cycles?

In the directed graph where each node (non-blocked cell) points to exactly one other node (the next cell according to the direction), a cycle exists if and only if there is a path that loops indefinitely.

In such a graph, each component is either a cycle or a chain leading into a cycle, or a chain leading to a blocked cell.

Wait, no. Because each node has exactly one outgoing edge. So each component is a chain that either ends in a blocked cell (if the next cell is blocked) or forms a cycle. Because once you leave a node, you can't have branches. So each component is either a tree (a chain) leading to a blocked cell, or a cycle. But how?

Wait, consider a node that points to another node which points to another, and so on. If this chain ever repeats a node, then there's a cycle. Otherwise, it will eventually reach a blocked cell.

So for each node, there are two possibilities: either the path from it eventually reaches a blocked cell (and thus is finite) or it forms a cycle (infinite loop).

Therefore, to check if any cell is part of a cycle, we can traverse each cell's path and see if we encounter a cycle.

But with n and m up to 2000x2000, this approach (doing a traversal for each cell) would be O(nm) per cell in the worst case, which is 4e6 * 4e6 steps, which is way too slow.

We need a way to detect cycles efficiently.

An alternative approach is to process each cell once and track visited nodes. Since each node has exactly one outgoing edge, we can process components by marking visited nodes. For each unvisited node, we can follow the path, marking visited nodes as we go. If during this traversal, we encounter a node that is already in the current path, then we have found a cycle. Otherwise, the path ends at a blocked cell.

This approach would process each cell exactly once, so the total time is O(nm), which is acceptable.

So the algorithm would be:

For each cell (i,j) not yet visited and not blocked:

- Start traversing the path from (i,j), keeping track of the path in a list or stack.

- For each step, check if the next cell is blocked. If yes, then all cells in the current path have a finite path length (their steps is the number of steps from their position to the blocked cell). Mark all as visited.

- If the next cell is already visited (but not part of the current path), then this path is part of a chain that leads to a blocked cell or a cycle. But since we have visited the next cell before, and since each cell is processed only once, this implies that the next cell is already part of a processed component that is either a cycle or a chain leading to a blocked cell. Therefore, the current path's steps can be determined based on the next cell's information.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, each cell is processed once. So if during processing a cell (i,j), we reach a cell that was already processed, we can stop. For example, if the current path leads to a cell (x,y) that was processed before, then:

- If (x,y) is part of a cycle, then (i,j) is part of a chain leading into the cycle. So (i,j) would have infinite steps, leading to the answer being -1.

- If (x,y) is part of a chain that leads to a blocked cell, then (i,j) has steps equal to the number of steps from (i,j) to (x,y) plus the steps of (x,y).

But this complicates things. So perhaps during the processing of each cell, we can track the steps and detect cycles.

Here's an approach inspired by the "tortoise and hare" algorithm for cycle detection:

But perhaps a better approach is to use memoization. For each cell (i,j), if we have already determined its steps or whether it is part of a cycle, we can store that information. Otherwise, process it.

But again, with 2000x2000 cells, this could be manageable.

Alternatively, we can perform a depth-first traversal for each unvisited cell, but track the current path. If during the traversal, we encounter a cell that is already in the current path, we have found a cycle.

But even that could be O(nm), since each cell is processed once.

Alternatively, here's a possible approach:

We can process each cell (i,j) as follows:

- If the cell is blocked, skip.

- If the cell has already been processed, skip.

- Otherwise, follow the path from (i,j), keeping track of all cells visited along the way.

- During this traversal, if a cell is encountered that is already in the current path (indicating a cycle), then all cells in the cycle are part of an infinite loop. Therefore, we need to check if any such cycle exists. If found, output -1.

- If the path reaches a blocked cell, then all cells in the path have their steps computed as the number of steps from their position to the blocked cell. For example, the cell just before the blocked cell has 1 step, the one before that has 2 steps, etc.

So the steps for each cell in the path can be computed in reverse order once the blocked cell is reached.

But how to detect cycles during this traversal?

Let's think of each traversal as building a list of cells. For each cell in the path, we check if it has been visited before. If during traversal, we reach a cell that is already in the current path (i.e., part of the current traversal), then there's a cycle. Otherwise, if the cell is processed and has steps, we can use that information.

So here's a possible algorithm:

Initialize a visited matrix, all set to false.

Initialize a steps matrix, all set to -1.

For each cell (i,j) in the grid:

   if cell (i,j) is blocked or visited, continue.

   Initialize a list path.

   current = (i,j)

   while True:

       if current is blocked:

           break

       if current is in path:

           // found a cycle

           return -1

       if visited[current] is True:

           // we can break and process the path

           break

       path.append(current)

       visited[current] = True

       next_cell = compute next cell based on direction of current

       current = next_cell

   // Now, process the path to compute steps.

   if the path is empty, continue.

   if the next_cell (current) is blocked:

       // the path leads to a blocked cell. Compute steps in reverse order.

       steps_increment = 1

       for cell in reversed(path):

           steps[cell] = steps_increment

           steps_increment += 1

   else:

       // current is visited and not blocked. So the path leads to a processed cell.

       // So steps for each cell in path is steps_increment_so_far + steps[next_cell]

       // But since the next_cell is already processed, we can use its steps.

       steps_increment = steps[current] + 1

       for cell in reversed(path):

           steps[cell] = steps_increment

           steps_increment += 1

Wait, but this code has to track the steps for each cell. Let's see.

But this approach might not handle cycles. Let's think.

Suppose during the traversal, the path leads to a cell that is already in the current path (i.e., a cycle is detected). In that case, we immediately return -1.

Otherwise, the path leads to a blocked cell or a cell that has been processed before.

But this approach would process each cell once, and compute steps accordingly.

But how to handle when a path leads to another cell that has already been processed (but not in the current path)?

For example, path A -> B -> C -> D. Suppose D has been processed and its steps is known. Then, the steps for A, B, C can be computed as steps[D] + 3, steps[D] + 2, steps[D] +1, respectively.

So this approach would work.

But what if the path leads to a cycle that has already been processed? Well, in this algorithm, when processing the path, if during the traversal, we reach a cell that is already visited but not part of the current path, we check whether that cell's steps is part of a cycle. But how?

Wait, in this algorithm, the steps for a cell are computed when processing its path. So, during processing, if we reach a cell that is already processed, we can use its steps. However, if that cell is part of a cycle, then its steps would not have been computed (since the algorithm would have detected the cycle and returned -1). But in that case, how did that cell get processed?

Wait, the algorithm processes cells in such a way that once a cell is marked as visited, it's not processed again. So if a cell is part of a cycle that was not detected during processing (i.e., the cycle was part of a previous processing), then that would mean that the previous processing did not detect the cycle. But that can't happen, because the algorithm would have detected the cycle during that processing.

Wait, no. For example, suppose we have a cycle A -> B -> C -> A. If during processing of A, the path is built as [A, B, C], then the next cell is A, which is in the path. So the algorithm detects a cycle and returns -1. Thus, the code would output -1.

But if during processing of D, which leads to A, and A is already visited (but was part of a cycle), then when processing D, the code would check if the next cell (A) is blocked. If not, then the code would process the path leading to A, but since A is visited, it would check if A is in the current path (which it's not), so it breaks. Then, the code would process the steps for D's path.

But since A is part of a cycle, its steps would not have been computed. So steps[A] is -1. Then, when processing D's path, the code would compute steps[D] = steps[A] + 1. But steps[A] is -1, which would be invalid. So this approach would not work in that case.

Wait, but in that scenario, during processing of the cycle (A, B, C, A), the code would have detected the cycle and returned -1, so the algorithm would have terminated, and thus processing D would not have happened. So the problem arises only if the code allows processing cells that are part of a cycle but not detected.

But according to the algorithm, during processing of a cell, if a cycle is detected in the current path, the code returns -1. So the algorithm stops immediately, and the answer is -1. Therefore, in cases where a cycle exists, the code will find it during processing some cell and output -1.

So the algorithm works as follows:

For each cell (i,j) not blocked and not visited:

   traverse the path starting at (i,j), adding each cell to the current path and marking them as visited.

   during traversal, if a cell is blocked, break.

   during traversal, if a cell is found that is already in the current path (cycle), return -1.

   otherwise, once the path is determined, compute steps in reverse order.

So the steps are correct.

Now, the code can be structured as follows:

- Read the grid.

- For each cell, check if it's blocked. If not, process it if not visited.

- During processing, track the path. If any cycle is found, output -1.

- Otherwise, compute steps for each cell in the path.

Once all cells are processed and no cycles are found, compute the maximum sum of steps.

Now, for the maximum sum, we need to consider:

The maximum possible sum is either:

- The sum of the two largest steps from non-blocked cells (s1 and s2, different cells).

- Or the maximum single step (if we choose one non-blocked and one blocked cell).

Because when we choose two different non-blocked cells, their steps are summed. If we choose one non-blocked and one blocked (steps 0), the sum is the steps of the non-blocked. So the maximum sum is the maximum between the sum of the top two steps (different cells) and the maximum step (if paired with a blocked cell).

But the maximum step could be part of the sum of two steps, which could be higher than the maximum single step.

For example, if the top two steps are 10 and 9, the sum is 19, which is larger than the maximum single step (10). So the maximum sum is 19.

But if there's only one non-blocked cell with steps 10, then the maximum sum is 10 (if paired with a blocked cell).

So the algorithm for the maximum sum is:

- Collect all steps of non-blocked cells into a list.

- If the list is empty, output 0 (since all cells are blocked).

- Else, sort the list in descending order.

- The maximum sum is the sum of the first two elements (if there are at least two elements), else the first element (paired with a blocked cell).

But wait, the two elements must be from different cells. So if the list has multiple copies of the maximum element (i.e., two cells with steps 10 each), then the sum would be 20.

So the code can collect all steps, then compute the maximum possible sum.

So:

max_single = max(steps.values(), default=0)

sorted_steps = sorted(steps.values(), reverse=True)

if len(sorted_steps) >= 2:

    max_sum = sorted_steps[0] + sorted_steps[1]

else:

    max_sum = max_single

the answer is max(max_sum, max_single).

Wait, no. Because in the case where the max_sum is sum of two, but max_single is higher than that (unlikely), but that's impossible. For example, sorted_steps[0] is 10, sorted_steps[1] is 5: sum is 15. max_single is 10, so max(15, 10) is 15. So the code would take the maximum between the sum and max_single. But in reality, if there are two cells, the sum is better. But if there's only one cell, then the sum is max_single.

Alternatively, the code can compute the maximum sum as the maximum between the sum of the top two and the top single. But when there are at least two elements, the sum is the sum of the two. When there's one, it's that element. So:

max_sum = 0

if len(sorted_steps) >= 2:

    max_sum = sorted_steps[0] + sorted_steps[1]

if len(sorted_steps) >=1:

    max_sum = max(max_sum, sorted_steps[0])

So the final answer is the maximum of these.

But no, the sum of two elements will always be >= the max_single (since sorted_steps[0] + sorted_steps[1] >= sorted_steps[0]).

Wait, no. For example, if sorted_steps[0] is 5 and sorted_steps[1] is 4: sum is 9, which is larger than 5.

So the maximum sum is the sum of the two largest elements, provided there are two elements. If there's only one element, it's that element.

But in code, when sorted_steps has length 1, sorted_steps[0] is the max, and sum is not possible (so max_sum is sorted_steps[0]).

So the code can be:

if not steps:

    answer = 0

else:

    sorted_list = sorted(steps.values(), reverse=True)

    max_sum = sorted_list[0]

    if len(sorted_list) >=2:

        max_sum = max(max_sum, sorted_list[0] + sorted_list[1])

    answer = max_sum

So the code will compute the correct maximum sum.

Now, the code structure in Python would be:

Read n and m.

Read the grid.

Check for cycles and compute steps.

If any cycle is detected, output -1.

Else, collect all steps (for non-blocked cells), and compute the maximum sum as above.

Now, the problem is to implement the cycle detection and steps computation efficiently.

Let's think about the steps and cycle detection.

Each cell (i,j) that is not blocked has a direction, which determines the next cell.

We need to process each cell once.

We can represent the grid as a list of lists.

We can create a visited matrix of booleans, initially all False.

We can create a steps matrix, initialized to 0 (but for blocked cells, steps is 0).

For each cell (i,j):

   if it's blocked or visited, skip.

   Else:

       create a path list.

       current = (i,j)

       while True:

           if current is blocked:

               break

           if current is in path:

               // cycle detected.

               print(-1)

               exit()

           if visited[current] is True:

               break

           visited[current] = True

           path.append(current)

           // compute next cell.

           direction = grid[current[0]][current[1]]

           next_i, next_j = compute based on direction.

           current = (next_i, next_j)

       // Now, process the path.

       if current is blocked:

           // compute steps.

           step = 1

           for cell in reversed(path):

               steps[cell[0]][cell[1]] = step

               step +=1

       else:

           // current has already been processed. Its steps is known.

           step = steps[current[0]][current[1]] + 1

           for cell in reversed(path):

               steps[cell[0]][cell[1]] = step

               step +=1

This way, each cell is processed once, and the steps are computed correctly.

But in Python, checking if current is in path can be O(len(path)) for each step, which can be O(nm) for each path, leading to O(nm) time overall. But for 2000x2000 grids, that would be 4e6 elements per path, leading to O( (2000*2000)^2 ) time, which is way too slow.

So this approach is not feasible for large grids.

We need a way to check for cycles in O(1) time per step.

Alternative approach: during the traversal, for each cell in the current path, track their positions in a dictionary or a set. Then, checking if current is in the path can be done in O(1) time.

Yes. So during the traversal, we can maintain a set of the current path's cells. For each step, after moving to the next cell, we check if it's in the set. If yes, cycle detected. Else, add it to the set and continue.

But this approach would require maintaining a set for each traversal, which could be memory-intensive for large paths. However, since each cell is processed exactly once, the total memory usage would be O(nm), which is manageable.

Wait, but for each path, the set is built and then discarded once the path is processed. So the maximum memory is O(nm) for all sets, but in practice, each cell is part of exactly one path.

So, modifying the algorithm:

For each cell (i,j) not blocked and not visited:

   path = []

   current_set = set()

   current = (i,j)

   while True:

       if current is blocked:

           break

       if current in current_set:

           // cycle detected.

           print(-1)

           exit()

       if visited[current] is True:

           break

       visited[current] = True

       current_set.add(current)

       path.append(current)

       // compute next cell.

       direction = grid[current[0]][current[1]]

       next_i, next_j = current[0], current[1]

       if direction == '>': next_j +=1

       elif direction == '<': next_j -=1

       elif direction == '^': next_i -=1

       elif direction == 'v': next_i +=1

       current = (next_i, next_j)

   // process the path.

   ...

This way, checking for current in current_set is O(1), and the cycle detection is done efficiently.

This reduces the cycle check from O(k) to O(1) per step, where k is the path length.

Now, the code can handle large grids.

Once the steps are computed for all cells, we collect all the steps from non-blocked cells into a list.

Then, compute the maximum sum as explained.

Now, let's test this approach with the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

1 1

#

Output: 0.

Processing:

All cells are blocked. So steps list is empty. Max sum is 0.

Sample Input 2:

3 4

####

#>^#

####

The board is 3x4. The middle row is #>^#.

The middle cell (1,1) is '>', which points to (1,2). (1,2) is '^', which points to (0,2), which is blocked. So steps for (1,1) is 2, steps for (1,2) is 1. So max sum is 2+1=3.

Sample Input 3:

3 4

####

#><#

####

Middle row is #><#. (1,1) is '>', points to (1,2). (1,2) is '<', points back to (1,1). So this forms a cycle. So output is -1.

Sample Input 4:

7 5

#####
##v##
##v##
#####
##^##
##^##
#####

Processing each cell. Let's see. The cells in row 1, column 2 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), let's assume 0-based.

The code should process each cell and find that there are no cycles. The steps are computed for each cell.

Sample Input 5:

7 5

#####
##v##
##v##
##<##
##^##
##^##
#####

Again, no cycles. The maximum steps sum is 5.

So the code should work.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But for handling large grids, the code must be efficient. Using lists for steps and visited, and using tuples for coordinates.

Potential issues:

- Handling the directions correctly, including moving out of bounds. But the problem states that all border cells are blocked. So any non-border cell's direction will point to another cell that is non-blocked. Wait, no. For example, a cell could have a direction that points to a blocked cell.

But according to the problem statement, all cells that touch the border are blocked. So the grid is surrounded by blocked cells. So any non-border cell's direction will point to a cell that is either blocked or another non-border cell.

So during the traversal, when we move to a cell that's blocked, the loop breaks, and steps are computed.

Now, code steps:

Read n and m.

Read the grid (n lines, each line is m characters).

Initialize visited as a 2D list of False.

Initialize steps as a 2D list of 0.

For each i in 0..n-1:

   for each j in 0..m-1:

       if grid[i][j] == '#':

           steps[i][j] = 0

       else:

           steps[i][j] = -1 (or some default)

But in the code, steps can be initialized to 0, and then overwritten.

Wait, no. Because for blocked cells, steps is 0. For non-blocked cells, steps is computed.

But the code's processing for non-blocked cells will set their steps.

Now, processing:

for i in range(n):

   for j in range(m):

       if grid[i][j] == '#' or visited[i][j]:

           continue

       path = []

       current_set = set()

       current = (i, j)

       is_blocked = False

       while True:

           ci, cj = current

           if grid[ci][cj] == '#':

               # current is blocked. path is done.

               is_blocked = True

               break

           if current in current_set:

               # cycle detected.

               print(-1)

               exit()

           if visited[ci][cj]:

               # current has been processed before.

               break

           visited[ci][cj] = True

           current_set.add(current)

           path.append(current)

           # compute next cell.

           direction = grid[ci][cj]

           ni, nj = ci, cj

           if direction == '>': nj +=1

           elif direction == '<': nj -=1

           elif direction == '^': ni -=1

           elif direction == 'v': ni +=1

           # check if ni and nj are within bounds?

           # According to the problem statement, all border cells are blocked. So any direction from a non-border cell will point to a cell within the grid.

           # But perhaps the code should handle that.

           # For example, if a cell is at (0,1), direction is '^', which would move to (-1, 1), which is out of bounds. But according to the problem statement, all border cells are blocked. So non-border cells cannot have directions that point outside the grid.

           # So we can assume that the next cell is within the grid.

           current = (ni, nj)

       if is_blocked:

           step = 1

           for cell in reversed(path):

               steps[cell[0]][cell[1]] = step

               step += 1

       else:

           # current is (ni, nj), which has been processed.

           # steps[ni][nj] is already computed.

           # compute steps for path cells.

           step = steps[current[0]][current[1]] + 1

           for cell in reversed(path):

               steps[cell[0]][cell[1]] = step

               step +=1

Once all cells are processed, collect all steps for non-blocked cells.

Now, collect the steps:

max_steps = []

for i in range(n):

   for j in range(m):

       if grid[i][j] != '#' and steps[i][j] > 0:

           max_steps.append(steps[i][j])

Then compute the maximum sum.

If no non-blocked cells, output 0.

Else:

sorted_steps = sorted(max_steps, reverse=True)

if len(sorted_steps) >= 2:

    max_sum = sorted_steps[0] + sorted_steps[1]

else:

    max_sum = sorted_steps[0]

print(max_sum)

Wait, but sorted_steps could be empty only if all non-blocked cells have steps 0, but that's impossible. Because if a non-blocked cell's path leads to a blocked cell in one step, steps would be 1.

Wait, steps for a non-blocked cell is the number of steps until it reaches a blocked cell. So steps for a cell that's adjacent to a blocked cell would have steps 1. So max_steps is the list of steps for all non-blocked cells.

So in code:

max_steps = []

for i in range(n):

    for j in range(m):

        if grid[i][j] != '#':

            # blocked cells have steps 0, others have steps computed.

            # but non-blocked cells have steps >=0?

            # No. For example, a non-blocked cell that is part of a chain leading to a blocked cell.

            # So steps for non-blocked cells are >=1.

            # Because steps is computed as the number of steps to reach a blocked cell.

            # So the code can collect all steps[i][j] for non-blocked cells.

            if grid[i][j] != '#':  # which is redundant since the loop is over grid[i][j] != '#'

                max_steps.append(steps[i][j])

So if there are no non-blocked cells (like sample input 1), max_steps is empty. So output 0.

Else:

sorted_steps = sorted(max_steps, reverse=True)

if len(sorted_steps) >=2:

    max_sum = sorted_steps[0] + sorted_steps[1]

else:

    max_sum = sorted_steps[0]

print(max_sum)

But wait, in sample input 2, the maximum steps are 2 and 1, sum is 3.

Sample input 4: the steps could be 2 and 2, sum is 4.

Sample input 5: steps are 3 and 2, sum is 5.

So the code should work.

Now, what about cells that are blocked? When choosing two pawns, we can place one pawn on a blocked cell (steps 0) and another on a non-blocked cell (steps x). The sum is x.

So the maximum sum is either the sum of two non-blocked cells, or one non-blocked and one blocked.

But in the code, the max_steps includes only non-blocked cells. So the sum of the two largest steps in max_steps is the sum of two non-blocked cells.

But pairing a non-blocked cell (steps x) with a blocked cell (steps 0) gives a sum of x. The maximum sum is the maximum between x and the sum of two x's. But since sorted_steps is sorted in descending order, the first element is the maximum. So if there's at least two elements, the sum of the first two is the maximum possible sum. If there's only one element, the sum is that element.

So the code is correct.

Now, let's code this.

But in Python, for large grids (2000x2000), using lists and loops is manageable. However, recursion would not be used here; it's all iterative.

Another possible optimization: precompute the next cell for each cell.

But the code as described should handle it.

Now, let's write the code.
