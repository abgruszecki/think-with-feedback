Okay, let's see. So the problem is about decrypting a binary code into a password. The input gives us an 80-character binary string, which is the encrypted password. Then there are 10 lines, each 10 characters long, representing the digits 0-9. Each of these 10-character binary codes corresponds to a unique digit. Our job is to split the 80-character string into 8 parts of 10 characters each, find which digit each part corresponds to, and then output the concatenated digits as the password.

Hmm. So the steps are:

1. Read the first line, which is the encrypted password. Split this into 8 chunks of 10 characters each. Wait, but the order might matter. Like, the first 10 characters are the first digit, then next 10 the second, etc. So the encrypted string is divided into 8 groups, each 10 bits, in order.

2. Then, for each of these 8 groups, find which of the 10 digit patterns (provided in the next 10 lines) matches exactly. Each of those lines is a 10-character binary code for digits 0-9, but the order of the input for digits isn't given. Like, the first line after the encrypted code is the code for 0, the next for 1, and so on. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says: "the next 10 lines contain pairwise distinct binary codes ... corresponding to numbers 0, 1, ..., 9." So the first of the 10 lines is the code for 0, the second for 1, etc. So each line in order represents the code for digit 0, 1, up to 9.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem statement says: "the next 10 lines contain pairwise distinct binary codes 10 characters in length, corresponding to numbers 0, 1, ..., 9." So the first line is the code for 0, the second for 1, ..., tenth for 9. So each line is in order from 0 to 9. So each of those 10 lines is the code for the digit equal to their position in the list. So the first of the 10 is 0's code, second is 1's, etc.

So for example, in the first example input, the next 10 lines start with 0100110000 as the first (digit 0's code), then 0100110010 (digit 1's code), etc. So when we split the encrypted string into 8 parts of 10 each, each part will match exactly one of these 10 codes, and the digit is the index of that code in the list.

So the plan is:

- Read the encrypted string (80 chars), split into 8 parts, each of 10 chars. So part 0 is first 10 chars, part1 is next 10, etc.

- Read the next 10 lines, each as a code. Store them in a list where the index is the digit. So codes[0] is the code for 0, codes[1] for 1, etc.

- For each of the 8 parts of the encrypted string, find which code in the list matches it exactly, then get the corresponding digit (the index). Then concatenate all 8 digits to get the password.

So the problem reduces to building a hash map from code string to digit. Because for each part of the encrypted string, we need to look up which code it matches and then get the digit.

But since the codes are stored in a list in order 0-9, we can create a dictionary where the key is the code string, and the value is the digit (the index in the list). Then for each of the 8 parts, look it up in this dictionary and append the corresponding digit.

That seems straightforward.

Now, the steps in code:

1. Read the first line as the encrypted code. Check it's 80 characters.

2. Split into 8 parts of 10. So [0:10], [10:20], ..., [70:80].

3. Read the next 10 lines. Each line is a code. So read each line, strip any whitespace (like newlines), and store in a list codes. So codes[0] is the code for 0, etc.

4. Create a code_to_digit dictionary, where code_to_digit[code] = index. So for each code in codes, add an entry to the dict.

5. For each part in the encrypted code parts, look it up in code_to_digit to get the digit.

6. Concatenate all digits into a string and output.

Now, the main thing is handling the input correctly and splitting the encrypted string into the right parts.

Potential edge cases: None, since the problem says that the solution exists, so each part of the encrypted code will match exactly one code in the list.

So in Python:

Read the encrypted code. Then read 10 lines, each is a code. Then split the encrypted code into 8 parts of 10 characters each. Then for each part, look up in the code_to_digit dict and build the password.

Now, code structure:

Read the first line:

encrypted = input().strip()

Then, codes = [input().strip() for _ in range(10)]

Then code_to_digit = {code: idx for idx, code in enumerate(codes)}

Then split encrypted into 8 parts:

password_parts = []
for i in range(8):
    start = i * 10
    end = start + 10
    part = encrypted[start:end]
    digit = code_to_digit[part]
    password_parts.append(str(digit))
password = ''.join(password_parts)
print(password)

That's the code.

Testing with the first example:

Encrypted string is 80 characters. Split into 8 parts of 10. Each part is one of the codes in the next 10 lines. Then the digits are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, hence output 12345678.

So this approach should work.

Now, for optimization. Since each code is 10 characters, comparing the parts with the codes is O(1) per lookup due to the hash table. So even for the maximum possible input, it's O(8) lookups. So no problem with time.

In terms of memory: all data is stored as strings. For 80 characters and 10 codes of 10 characters each, that's 80 + 100 = 180 characters. So no problem with memory.

Therefore, this approach is optimal. There's no way to get faster than O(1) per lookup here, since we can't do better than hash table lookups. The code is straightforward and efficient.

encrypted = input().strip()
codes = [input().strip() for _ in range(10)]
code_map = {code: str(i) for i, code in enumerate(codes)}
password = ''.join(code_map[encrypted[i*10:(i+1)*10]] for i in range(8))
print(password)
