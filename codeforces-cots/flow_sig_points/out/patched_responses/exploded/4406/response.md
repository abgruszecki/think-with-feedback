<think>
Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read it carefully.

So, the problem is about a game between Qingshan and Daniel. They take turns moving their indices (x and y) on a permutation. The rules for moving are different for each. The goal is to find the number of initial x positions where Qingshan can win if both play optimally.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the rules:

Qingshan's turn: she moves x to x' such that x' is adjacent to x (differs by 1), not equal to y, and p[x'] < p[x]. So each move must be to a lower value adjacent position, and can't be where y is.

Daniel's turn: he moves y to y' adjacent to y, not equal to x, and p[y'] > p[y]. So he moves to higher value adjacent positions, and can't be where x is.

The person who can't move loses. So if Qingshan can't make a move on her turn, Daniel wins. And vice versa.

We need to count all x (from 1 to n) such that when Qingshan chooses x first, and Daniel chooses y optimally (to minimize Qingshan's chances), Qingshan can still win.

So for each possible x, Daniel will choose the best possible y (different from x) to make Qingshan lose. We need to find x's where Qingshan can win regardless of Daniel's choice of y (but Daniel will choose the worst possible y for her).

Wait, no: Daniel's choice of y is after x is chosen. So for each x, Daniel picks any y != x. We need to see if there exists a y that Daniel can choose such that Qingshan cannot win. But wait, no: the problem says "the number of possible x that make Qingshan win when Daniel chooses y optimally (to make her lose)".

So for each x, after x is chosen, Daniel picks y (y !=x) that gives Qingshan the worst possible outcome. So Qingshan will win if, even in the worst case (Daniel's best choice of y), she can win.

So the approach is: for each x, find all possible y (y !=x) that Daniel can choose, then determine for each (x,y) pair whether Qingshan can win when both play optimally. Then, for x to be counted, there must be no possible y that Daniel can choose such that Qingshan loses. Wait, no: no, because Daniel will choose the y that maximizes his own chance of winning. So, for x to be a good choice, Qingshan must win for all possible y choices that Daniel can make. Or is it that Daniel can choose any y, and Qingshan must have a winning strategy for that y?

Wait, the problem says Daniel chooses y after x is chosen. So for x to be counted, Qingshan must have a winning strategy for all possible y that Daniel could choose. Or is it that Daniel will choose the best possible y to make Qingshan lose, and we need x's where even in that case, Qingshan can win.

So the correct approach is: For each x, Daniel will choose a y (y !=x) that minimizes Qingshan's chance of winning. So we need to check if, for all possible y choices that Daniel can make (after x is chosen), Qingshan can win. But that's impossible because Daniel can choose any y, and for some x, there might be some y where Qingshan can't win. So the correct condition is: for x to be counted, there exists at least one y such that when Daniel chooses that y, Qingshan can win. But no, that's not right. Because Daniel will choose the best possible y to make Qingshan lose. So, for x to be a valid choice, Qingshan must win even when Daniel chooses the y that makes it hardest for her.

So for each x, we need to determine whether for all possible y choices (y !=x) that Daniel could make, Qingshan can win. No, that can't be. Because Daniel is trying to make her lose, he would choose the y that makes Qingshan's chances the worst. So the x is counted if, even in the worst case (Daniel picks the best possible y to make Qingshan lose), Qingshan can still win.

So the problem reduces to: for each x, find the minimal possible outcome (for Qingshan) across all possible y choices (y !=x). If that minimal outcome is a win for Qingshan, then x is counted.

Wait, no. Because Daniel will choose the y that makes it as hard as possible for Qingshan to win. So for each x, Daniel can choose any y (y !=x). Among all possible y choices, Daniel will pick the one where Qingshan has the least chance of winning. So for x to be counted, Qingshan must be able to win even when Daniel chooses the worst possible y for her. So the x is valid if, for all possible y (that Daniel can choose), Qingshan can win. Or is it that for x to be valid, there exists a y that Daniel can choose where Qingshan can't win, but Daniel would not choose that y? Wait, no. Daniel's goal is to win, so he will choose a y that gives him the best chance to win. So, for x to be valid, when Daniel chooses the best possible y (for his own winning), Qingshan can still win.

So, the correct approach is:

For each x:

- Find all possible y (y !=x) that Daniel can choose.

- For each such y, compute the game outcome when both play optimally.

- Daniel will choose the y that gives Qingshan the worst outcome (i.e., if there exists a y where Qingshan loses, Daniel will choose that y, so x is invalid).

Therefore, x is valid if, for all possible y (y !=x) that Daniel can choose, Qingshan can win. Because Daniel will choose the y that leads to Qingshan losing, if such a y exists, then x is invalid. So x is valid only if for all possible y choices, Qingshan can win. Otherwise, Daniel will choose a y that makes Qingshan lose, hence x is invalid.

Wait, that makes sense. Because if there's even one y where Qingshan loses, Daniel will choose that y. So x is only counted if there are no such y. That is, x is valid if, for every possible y that Daniel can choose (y !=x), Qingshan can win.

Wait, but that's impossible for n >=2, because Daniel can choose any y !=x. So how can x be such that for all y !=x, Qingshan can win? Because Daniel can choose y to be adjacent to x, which may block Qingshan's moves.

But the first example in the problem shows that such x exists. Let's see.

First example input: 5, permutation [1,2,5,4,3]. Output is 1. The valid x is 3 (index 3, 1-based). So when x=3, Daniel must choose y !=3. Let's say Daniel chooses y=1. Then, the game plays out. Let's see:

Qingshan's first move: she must move x' to 2 or 4 (adjacent to 3). But p[2]=2 <5, p[4]=4 <5. So possible x' are 2 and 4. But she can't move to where y is (y=1). So if y is 1, she can move to 2 or 4. Then Daniel's turn would be to move y. Wait, but maybe Daniel's choice of y=1 is not optimal. Let's think.

Wait, for x=3, Daniel can choose any y !=3. So possible y's are 1,2,4,5.

If Daniel chooses y=2, then Qingshan's possible moves are x'=2 (but y is 2, so not allowed) or x'=4. So she can move to 4. Then Daniel's turn: he has to move y. His current y is 2, and x is 4. So Daniel can move to 1 (p=1 <2? No, Daniel must move to higher. p[1]=1 < p[2]=2, so moving to 1 would be invalid. So Daniel can't move. So Daniel loses, Qingshan wins.

Wait, but Daniel's move is to choose y. So if Daniel chooses y=2, then when Qingshan moves to x'=4, Daniel has to move y to a position adjacent to 2 (so 1 or 3). But x is 4. So y can move to 1 or 3, but:

- For y=2, possible moves are to y'=1 or 3. But y' must not be equal to x (which is 4). So allowed. Also, p[y'] must be > p[y], which is 2.

So p[1] is 1 <2, so can't move to 1. p[3] is 5>2, so Daniel can move to 3. Then, x is 4, y is 3. Qingshan's turn: she can move to 3 (but y is 3 now, so invalid), or to 5. p[5] is 3 <4. So she can move to 5. Then Daniel's turn: y is 3. He can move to 2 or 4. But x is 5. Moving to 4: p[4]=4>3. So allowed. So he moves to 4. Now, Qingshan's turn: x is 5. She can move to 4 (but y is 4) or nowhere else. So she can't move. She loses. So in that case, Qingshan loses. Wait, but that's when Daniel chooses y=2. So if Daniel chooses y=2, then he can win, making x=3 invalid. But in the first example, x=3 is considered valid. So there's a contradiction here. Wait, but maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, the first example's output is 1, meaning x=3 is the only valid option. So why is that? Let's re-express the first example.

Permutation is [1,2,5,4,3]. So indices 1-5:

Indices: 1 → 1, 2 →2, 3→5, 4→4,5→3.

When Qingshan chooses x=3. Daniel must choose y !=3. Let's see possible choices.

If Daniel chooses y=5:

Then, Qingshan's first move. She must move x to 2 or 4 (adjacent to 3). Let's check their values:

x=3, p=5.

So possible x' are 2 (p=2 <5) and 4 (p=4 <5). But y is 5, which is not adjacent to x=3. So in her first move, she can choose either x'=2 or 4. Let's suppose she chooses x'=4. Then x becomes 4. Daniel's turn. y is 5. He must move to adjacent positions (4 or 6, but 6 is invalid). So y can move to 4. But x is 4, so that's invalid. So Daniel can't move. He loses. So Qingshan wins.

But what if Daniel chooses y=4? Then, Qingshan's first move: she can go to 2 or 4. But y is 4, so x' cannot be 4. So she must move to 2. Then x is 2. Daniel's turn: y is 4. He must move to 3 or 5. p[3] is5>4, so moving to 3 is possible. So he moves to 3. Now, x is 2, y is3. Qingshan's turn: she can move to 1 or 3. But y is3, so 3 is invalid. So she moves to1. x is1. Daniel's turn: y is3. He can move to2 or4. But x is1. So moving to2 is allowed. p[2]=2 <3's current p=5 (wait, no: Daniel's movement must be to a position where p[y']>p[y]. Current y is3, p=5. So Daniel can only move to adjacent positions with p[y']>5. But adjacent to 3 are 2 (p=2) and4 (p=4). Both are <5. So Daniel can't move. So Qingshan wins.

Wait, this is getting complicated. So perhaps the correct approach is to model the game for each possible x and y and see who wins. But with n up to 1e5, we need an O(n) or O(n) approach. So brute force is impossible.

So how can we model this efficiently?

The key idea is to precompute for each position the possible moves and determine the outcome (win or loss) for each possible state (x, y, turn) through dynamic programming or memoization. But with 1e5 positions, even O(n^2) is impossible.

Thus, we need a way to model the game for any x and y efficiently.

Alternative approach: for each x, find the best possible y that Daniel can choose (the one that leads to Qingshan's loss), and check if even in that case, Qingshan can still win.

But how?

Let's think about the game structure. Each player takes turns moving, and the moves are constrained. The game is a two-player impartial game with perfect information, so we can model it using Grundy numbers or some similar concept. However, since the game state is (x, y, turn), and each turn alternates between Qingshan and Daniel, the state space is O(n^2) which is not feasible for n=1e5.

Alternative approach: find for each position x and y, the parity of the maximum number of steps Qingshan can take before losing. But again, this seems difficult.

Alternative idea: the game is a directed acyclic graph where each node is a state (x, y, turn), and edges represent valid moves. The outcome of the game (win/loss) can be determined using memoization. However, for n=1e5, this is impossible.

Thus, we need a way to precompute for each x and y whether Qingshan can win when starting from that x and y. Then, for each x, check if all possible y's (y !=x) lead to a Qingshan win. But even that is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

Wait, but maybe there's a pattern or structure in the permutation that allows us to compute this efficiently.

Let's analyze the possible moves for each player.

Qingshan's moves are constrained to positions with lower p values, adjacent, not equal to y. Daniel's moves are constrained to higher p values, adjacent, not equal to x.

The game alternates between Qingshan and Daniel. The game ends when a player can't move. The first player to not move loses.

So for a given x and y, the game outcome depends on the possible paths each can take, considering the other's position.

But modeling this for all possible x and y is not feasible.

Alternative approach: for each x, precompute the possible y's that Daniel can choose to block Qingshan's moves.

Wait, Daniel's optimal choice of y is to select a position that can block Qingshan's movement options. For example, if Daniel can choose a y adjacent to x, then in Qingshan's first move, she can't move to that y, which may restrict her options.

But how to model this?

Another thought: the maximum possible moves for Qingshan depend on the "peak" structure of the permutation. For example, if x is a peak (higher than adjacent elements), then Qingshan has multiple options to move. But Daniel's choice of y may block some of those options.

Alternatively, perhaps for each x, Daniel can choose a y that is adjacent to x, thereby blocking one of Qingshan's possible first moves. If Qingshan can't move in her first step, then Daniel wins.

So for x to be a valid choice, Qingshan must have at least one possible first move (even after Daniel chooses a y blocking some direction). So Daniel will try to block as many of Qingshan's initial moves as possible.

Thus, for each x, the best y Daniel can choose is the one that blocks the maximum number of Qingshan's possible first moves. If Daniel can block all first moves, then Qingshan loses. Otherwise, she has a move and the game continues.

But how to compute this?

Let's think for a given x:

Qingshan's possible first moves are left (x-1) and right (x+1), provided they are within bounds and their p is less than p[x].

So, for x, let's find all possible adjacent positions (left and right) where p is less than p[x]. Let's call these possible directions.

Daniel will choose a y (y !=x) such that y is one of these directions. Because if he can block one direction, Qingshan's options are reduced.

For example, if x can move left and right, Daniel can choose y to be left (x-1) or right (x+1). Then, Qingshan can't move in that direction. If after blocking, Qingshan has no moves left, then Daniel wins.

So Daniel's optimal choice is to choose a y that blocks as many of Qingshan's first moves as possible. If he can block all first moves (i.e., if Qingshan's initial possible directions are all blocked by y), then Qingshan can't move and loses.

Thus, for x to be valid, even after Daniel blocks one of the possible directions, Qingshan must still have a move. Wait, but Daniel can only choose one y. So for example, if Qingshan has two possible directions (left and right), Daniel can block one of them. Then Qingshan can choose the other direction.

But in this case, Daniel's choice of y would block one direction, but Qingshan can choose the other.

So in this scenario, Qingshan can still make a move, so the game continues.

But the game outcome depends on the subsequent moves. So even if Qingshan has a move after Daniel blocks one direction, Daniel may still win in later steps.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe the key idea is to find for each x the minimal possible outcome (whether Qingshan can win) when Daniel chooses the best possible y. And to compute this, we can precompute some information about x's possible moves and the game's outcome.

Alternative approach:

For each x, compute the maximum number of steps Qingshan can move (possibly in a certain direction), and similarly for Daniel. Then, model the game based on these numbers.

But how?

Another thought: the game is a sequence of moves where each player alternately makes moves. Qingshan's moves are constrained to strictly descending values, and Daniel's to strictly ascending. Also, the positions can't overlap.

But since the permutation is a permutation, each element is unique, so the paths for each player are unique.

Wait, but the players can move in any direction as long as it's adjacent. For example, Qingshan can move left to a lower value, then right to a lower value again, etc., as long as each step is lower.

But this seems hard to model.

Alternative idea: for each position x, precompute the possible "downhill" paths (Qingshan's possible moves) and "uphill" paths (Daniel's possible moves). The lengths of these paths could determine the outcome.

But even so, how do the paths of x and y interact?

Perhaps the key is to find for each x, the minimal number of steps Qingshan can take (under optimal play) when Daniel chooses the worst possible y. Then, if this minimal number is even or odd, we can determine the outcome.

But this is vague.

Let's look at the sample input 1:

Permutation is [1, 2, 5,4,3]. So index 3 is the peak (5). When x=3:

Possible initial moves for Qingshan are left (2) and right (4). Daniel can choose y=2 or y=4 to block one of these.

If Daniel chooses y=2, then Qingshan's only initial move is to 4. Then, Daniel's turn. His y must be adjacent to his previous position (2). Let's assume Daniel's initial y is 2. Then, Daniel must move to a higher value adjacent to y. The adjacent positions are 1 and 3. But x is now 4, so y' can be 3 (since 3 !=4). p[3]=5>2, so Daniel can move to 3. Now, y is 3.

Qingshan's turn: x is 4. She can move to 3 (blocked by y=3) or 5 (p=3 <4). So she moves to 5. Daniel's turn: y is 3. He must move to a higher value adjacent to 3. Adjacent positions are 2 and 4. p[2] is 2<3, so invalid. p[4] is4>3. So Daniel moves to4. Now, x is5 and y is4. Qingshan can move to4 (blocked) or nowhere. So she loses.

But wait, in this case, Daniel chooses y=2, which leads to Qingshan losing. But in the sample input, x=3 is considered valid, which implies that there exists a y such that Qingshan wins. But Daniel can choose y=2, which would make her lose. So why is x=3 counted as valid?

Ah, I must have made a mistake here. Because according to the problem statement, x=3 is valid. So perhaps my analysis is wrong. Let me re-examine the first sample.

Sample input 1:

n=5, permutation is [1,2,5,4,3].

x=3 (p=5). Daniel can choose any y except 3. So possible y's are 1,2,4,5.

Daniel's optimal choice is the y that makes Qingshan lose. So if he can choose y=2, which in my analysis leads to Qingshan losing, then x=3 would not be counted. But the sample says it is counted. So this indicates a mistake in my previous analysis.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the game steps. Let's re-analyze the scenario where x=3 and Daniel chooses y=2.

Initial x=3, y=2.

Qingshan's turn:

Possible moves: x' must be adjacent to 3 (2 or 4), not equal to y=2, and p[x'] <5.

So possible x' is 4 (since 2 is blocked by y=2). So Qingshan moves to x=4.

Daniel's turn: he must move y from 2 to adjacent positions (1 or 3), but y' can't be x=4.

Possible y' positions:

- 1: p[1]=1 < p[2]=2 → Daniel's move requires p[y'] >2. So invalid.

- 3: p[3]=5>2. So Daniel can move to 3. Now, y=3.

Qingshan's turn: x is 4. She must move to adjacent positions (3 or5), not equal to y=3.

Possible moves:

3 is blocked by y=3, so she can move to5 (p=3<4). So x becomes5.

Daniel's turn: y=3. He must move to adjacent positions (2 or4), not equal to x=5.

Possible y':

- 2: p=2 <3 → Daniel can't move to lower values.

-4: p=4>3. So he can move to4. Now, y=4.

Qingshan's turn: x=5. She can move to4 (blocked by y=4) or nothing. So she can't move. She loses.

So in this scenario, Daniel chooses y=2, which leads to Qingshan losing. But according to the sample input, x=3 is a valid choice. So why is this the case?

Ah! Because perhaps Daniel cannot choose y=2. Because when x=3, Daniel must choose a y !=x. But y=2 is allowed.

Wait, but in this case, Daniel can choose y=2, which leads to Qingshan's loss. But according to the sample output, x=3 is counted. So this suggests that my analysis is wrong.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let's check the sample explanation.

In the first test case, the explanation says that Qingshan can only choose x=3 to win. So when x=3, Daniel chooses y=1. Let's see.

x=3, y=1.

Qingshan's first move: can go to 2 or4 (since y=1 is not adjacent to x=3). So possible moves.

She can choose x'=2. Then x=2.

Daniel's turn: y=1. He must move to adjacent positions (2). p[2]=2>1. So he can move to2. But then x is2 and y becomes2, which is not allowed (since x' and y can't be same). Wait, the problem statement says Daniel chooses y' such that y' !=x. So when moving y to 2, x is2. So y' is2, which is equal to x. So this is invalid.

So Daniel can't move to 2. So he can't move. So Daniel loses. So Qingshan wins.

Ah, so when Daniel chooses y=1, Qingshan can win. But when Daniel chooses y=2, Qingshan can lose. So Daniel will choose y=2. Therefore, x=3 is not a valid choice. But according to the sample, x=3 is valid. So there's a contradiction.

This suggests that my analysis is incorrect. What's the correct way to look at this?

The sample explanation says that in the first test case, when x=3 is chosen, Daniel can choose y=1. Then the game proceeds:

Qingshan moves to x'=3 (wait, no. Let me read the explanation again.

In the first test case explanation:

Qingshan chooses x=3. Daniel chooses y=1.

Qingshan's first move is x'=3 (no, that's the same position). Or wait, maybe the explanation had a typo. Let me re-read:

In the first turn (Qingshan's) Qingshan chooses x'=3 and changes x to3. Wait, that can't be. Maybe the explanation is not well-written. Alternatively, perhaps the explanation refers to x'=3, but that's the same as x. So perhaps the explanation is wrong. Or perhaps the sample explanation is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the sample explanation is referring to x'=3 as a typo. Let me think differently.

Sample explanation says:

Qingshan chooses x=3, Daniel chooses y=1. Then Qingshan's first move changes x to3 → which is the same as before. That's impossible. So maybe the explanation is a typo. Let's re-examine.

Wait, the sample explanation says:

In the first test case, Qingshan can only choose x=3 to win. So when x=3 is chosen, Daniel chooses y=1. Then Qingshan's first move is x'=3 → which can't be. So perhaps it's a typo and she moves to x'=2 or 4.

Wait, perhaps the explanation is as follows:

In the first turn (Qingshan's) she moves to x=2 or x=4. Let's assume she moves to x=3's left neighbor (x=2). Then Daniel's move is to choose y'=2. But that's not possible because his current y is 1.

Wait, perhaps the sample explanation is correct, but I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the sample explanation is incorrect, but the code is correct.

Alternatively, maybe when x=3 is chosen, Daniel's optimal choice is not y=2. Let me consider all possible y choices for x=3.

Possible y choices for x=3: 1,2,4,5.

Daniel wants to choose the y that makes Qingshan lose.

So for each y, simulate the game.

Case 1: y=1.

Qingshan's initial moves: x can move to 2 or 4.

She picks one.

Let's say she moves to 4. Then x=4, y=1.

Daniel's turn: he must move y from 1 to adjacent positions (2). Check if p[2] (2) >1. Yes. So y becomes2.

Qingshan's turn: x=4. Possible moves: 3 (p=5>4 → invalid) or 5 (p=3<4). But y is2, so 3 is allowed. So she can move to5.

Now, x=5, y=2.

Daniel's turn: must move y from 2 to adjacent positions (1 or3). Check p[1]=1 <2 → invalid. p[3]=5>2 → valid. So y becomes3.

Qingshan's turn: x=5. Possible moves:4 (blocked by y=3?) No. y=3 is at position3, which is adjacent to4. Wait, x is5, y is3. So when Qingshan moves, she must choose adjacent positions to x=5: 4 and 6 (invalid). So possible x' is4. But y is3, which is not adjacent to x=5. So moving to4 is allowed. p[4]=4 <5. So she moves to4.

Daniel's turn: y is3. He must move to adjacent positions (2 or4). p[2]=2<3 → invalid. p[4]=4>3. So he moves to4, but x is4. So y' can't be4. So Daniel can't move. He loses. Qingshan wins.

So in this case, when Daniel chooses y=1, Qingshan wins.

But Daniel could choose y=2, which leads to Qingshan losing.

But Daniel will choose y=2. So x=3 is invalid. But according to the sample, x=3 is valid. So why is that?

This is a contradiction. What am I missing here?

Ah! The problem states that after Qingshan chooses x, Daniel chooses y. So Daniel can choose any y except x. But in this case, when x=3, Daniel can choose y=2. If he does so, then Qingshan's initial moves are blocked.

But why does the sample say that x=3 is valid? Because according to the sample explanation, when x=3 is chosen, Daniel chooses y=1, and Qingshan can win. But Daniel can choose y=2, leading to a loss. So x=3 should not be counted.

This suggests that there is a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm not considering all possible paths.

Alternatively, perhaps Daniel cannot choose y=2. But why? Because x=3 is the initial choice, and Daniel can choose any y !=3. So y=2 is allowed.

This is very confusing.

Let me think differently. Perhaps for x=3, Daniel cannot choose y=2. But that's not possible. Because y can be any index except x. So why would Daniel choose y=1 instead of y=2?

Because Daniel's choice is to maximize his own chance of winning. So if he can choose a y that makes Qingshan lose, he will.

So for x=3, Daniel must choose the best possible y to make Qingshan lose. So if there exists any y (y !=3) where Qingshan can't win when x=3 and Daniel chooses that y, then x=3 is invalid.

But according to the sample, x=3 is valid, which suggests that for all possible y choices, Qingshan can win.

But in my analysis, when Daniel chooses y=2, Qingshan loses. So sample must be wrong, but that's impossible.

Hmm. So there must be a mistake in my analysis of the scenario where x=3 and y=2.

Let me re-examine that scenario step by step.

x=3, y=2.

Qingshan's first move: possible x' are 2 (but y=2 → invalid) and4 (valid). So she moves to4.

Daniel's turn: y is2. He must move to adjacent positions (1 or3). 

Possible moves:

- y'=1: p[1]=1 <2 → invalid for Daniel's move (he must move to higher p).

- y'=3: p=5>2 → valid. But x is now4. So y'=3 is allowed (since 3 !=4).

Daniel moves to3.

Qingshan's turn: x=4. She can move to3 (blocked by y=3) or5 (p=3<4). So she moves to5.

Daniel's turn: y is3. He must move to adjacent positions (2 or4). 

For moving to2: p=2<3 → invalid.

For moving to4: p=4>3 → valid. But x is5. So y'=4 is allowed.

Daniel moves to4.

Qingshan's turn: x=5. She can move to4 (blocked by y=4) or nowhere else. So she loses.

So in this case, Qingshan loses.

But sample says x=3 is valid. So why is this counted?

Ah! Because Daniel cannot choose y=2. Because when Daniel chooses y=2, he has to have y !=x. x is3, y=2 is allowed.

So this implies that the sample is wrong, which is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a condition that Daniel cannot choose y adjacent to x. But the problem statement does not say that. Daniel can choose any y !=x.

So why is the sample's x=3 considered valid?

Ah! Maybe the initial assumption is wrong. Let's re-read the problem statement.

The problem says:

Qingshan chooses x, then Daniel chooses y (y !=x).

The game proceeds as follows:

- Qingshan's turn: move x to x' (adjacent to x, not equal to y, p[x'] < p[x]).

- Daniel's turn: move y to y' (adjacent to y, not equal to x, p[y'] > p[y]).

The game continues until a player can't move.

So when x=3 and y=2, in Qingshan's first move, she can't move to2 (since y=2), but can move to4. She moves to4.

Then Daniel's turn: y=2. He must move to a higher p adjacent to 2 (positions 1 or3). p[1] is1 <2, so invalid. p[3] is5>2. So he can move to3.

Now, y=3. Qingshan's x is4. She can move to3 (blocked by y=3) or to5 (p=3<4). So she moves to5.

Daniel's turn: y=3. He must move to adjacent positions (2 or4). p[2]=2<3 → invalid. p[4]=4>3. So he moves to4. Now, y=4.

Qingshan's turn: x=5. She can move to4 (blocked by y=4) → no moves. So she loses.

But according to the sample, x=3 is valid. So why?

This suggests that there's a mistake in the analysis. Or perhaps the sample explanation is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps Daniel cannot move to3 because x is4. Wait, when Daniel moves to3, x is4. So y' is3, which is different from x=4. So it's allowed.

So the analysis is correct, but the sample says x=3 is valid. How to resolve this?

Ah! Maybe the problem statement has an error. Or perhaps the sample's explanation is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different way to play the game that leads to Qingshan's victory even when Daniel chooses y=2.

Let's see: when x=3, y=2.

Qingshan's first move: she can only move to4.

Daniel's turn: moves to3.

Qingshan's move: move to5.

Daniel's turn: moves to4.

Qingshan can't move. She loses.

So in this scenario, Qingshan loses.

But the sample says x=3 is valid. So this is a contradiction.

Thus, I must have made a mistake in my analysis. Let me re-examine the problem statement once again.

Wait! The problem states that after Qingshan chooses x, Daniel chooses y (y !=x). Then, the game starts with Qingshan's turn. So the first move is Qingshan's.

In the scenario where x=3 and y=2:

Qingshan's first move: she can move to4.

Daniel's turn: he moves to3.

Qingshan's next move: x is4. She can move to3 (blocked by y=3) or5 (p=3<4). She moves to5.

Daniel's turn: y=3. He can move to4 (p=4>3). So he moves to4. Now, y=4.

Qingshan's turn: x=5. She can't move. She loses.

So this is a valid scenario where Daniel chooses y=2, leading to Qingshan's loss. So x=3 should not be counted.

But sample says it is. So this indicates that my analysis is incorrect. Therefore, I must find where I went wrong.

Alternative idea: perhaps when Daniel moves to3 (from y=2), he is not allowed to move there because x is4.

Wait, the problem states that when Daniel moves y to y', y' must not be equal to x. So when x is4, and Daniel moves to3, which is not equal to x=4. So it's allowed.

So no error there.

Perhaps there's another path Qingshan can take. For example, when she moves to4 in her first move, perhaps Daniel chooses a different path.

Wait, Daniel's move after Qingshan's move to4:

He is at y=2. He can move to3. Are there any other options?

No. Because p[1] is1 <2, so moving to1 is invalid. So he must move to3.

So Qingshan has no other option.

So, according to this analysis, x=3 is not a valid choice, but the sample says it is. So this is a contradiction.

Ah! I think I see the mistake. The problem statement says that Daniel's move must satisfy p[y'] > p[y]. So in the case where Daniel moves from y=3 (after moving there from y=2), he can only move to positions where p[y'] >5, which is impossible. So perhaps that changes the outcome.

Wait, when Daniel moves to3, his new p[y'] is5. So when he is at3, his next move must be to a higher p. But there are no higher p values than5. So when he is at3, he can't move further. So let's re-examine the scenario.

Scenario:

x=3, y=2.

Qingshan moves to4.

Daniel's turn: y=2. He must move to3 (p=5>2). So y becomes3.

Qingshan's turn: x=4. She can move to5 (p=3 <4). So x becomes5.

Daniel's turn: y=3. He must move to a higher p. But adjacent positions are2 (p=2 <5) and4 (p=4 <5). So he can't move. So Daniel loses. Qingshan wins.

Ah! That's the key mistake in my previous analysis. Daniel's move from y=3 requires p[y'] >5, which is impossible. So after Qingshan moves to5, Daniel cannot move and thus loses.

So in this scenario, Qingshan wins.

So the mistake was in my earlier step when Daniel moves from3 to4. Wait, no. Let's re-examine the steps.

When Daniel is at y=3 (p=5), he must move to a higher p. But no such positions exist. So when Daniel is at y=3, he can't move. So when Qingshan moves to5, Daniel's turn starts with y=3. He can't move. So he loses. Thus, Qingshan wins.

Ah! This changes the entire analysis. So in this scenario, Qingshan wins.

So the steps are:

x=3, y=2.

Qingshan moves to4.

Daniel moves to3.

Qingshan's move to5.

Daniel can't move (y=3, p=5). So he loses. Qingshan wins.

So in this scenario, when Daniel chooses y=2, Qingshan wins.

Ah! So my previous analysis was wrong because I thought Daniel could move to4 from3. But p[4] is4 <5, so he can't. So Daniel can't move. So Qingshan wins.

Thus, for x=3, Daniel's choice of y=2 leads to Qingshan's win.

So what about Daniel's other choices?

For example, Daniel chooses y=4.

Qingshan's first moves are to2 or4. But y=4 blocks 4. So she must move to2.

Daniel's turn: y=4. He can move to3 (p=5>4) or5 (p=3 <4 → invalid). So he moves to3.

Qingshan's turn: x=2. She can move to1 (p=1<2) or3 (blocked by y=3). So she moves to1.

Daniel's turn: y=3. He can't move to higher values. So he loses. Qingshan wins.

So regardless of Daniel's choice of y, Qingshan can win. So x=3 is a valid choice.

Thus, the sample is correct.

This indicates that the key factor is the ability of Daniel to force Qingshan into a losing position, but in all cases, Qingshan can find a path to victory.

Thus, the problem requires us to find x's where for every possible y that Daniel chooses, Qingshan can win.

To model this, for each x, we need to check all possible y !=x and ensure that Qingshan can win in all cases. But with n up to 1e5, we need an efficient way to compute this.

So the approach is to precompute for each x the possible moves and determine whether Qingshan can win for any possible y.

But how?

The key observation is that Daniel's optimal strategy is to choose a y that is as close to x as possible, blocking one of the directions. But even if he blocks one direction, Qingshan can choose the other direction and continue.

So for each x, we need to determine whether Qingshan can win even if Daniel chooses the worst possible y (blocking one of the directions).

But how to model this?

An alternative idea: Qingshan's optimal play is to move along the longest possible path of decreasing values, avoiding y's positions. Daniel's optimal play is to move along increasing paths, avoiding x's positions.

But how do these paths interact?

Another observation: the outcome of the game depends on the parity of the number of moves each player can make. For example, if Qingshan can make more moves than Daniel, she wins. But this is not necessarily the case because the players alternate turns.

Thus, the problem reduces to determining for each x and y, whether the maximum number of moves Qingshan can make (considering Daniel's moves) is greater than Daniel's maximum moves.

But how to compute this efficiently.

Alternative approach inspired by the sample analysis:

For each x, Qingshan's optimal move is to find a direction (left or right) where she can make the longest possible sequence of moves. Daniel will try to block this by choosing y in that direction. But if Qingshan can find a path that Daniel cannot block, then x is valid.

But how to model this.

Another observation: Qingshan's possible moves form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node is a position and edges are moves to lower adjacent positions. Similarly for Daniel's moves to higher positions.

The outcome of the game depends on the maximum number of moves Qingshan can make before being blocked, and Daniel's moves.

But again, this is not helpful for large n.

Alternative idea: for each position x, compute the length of the longest possible path Qingshan can take when moving downhill, and similarly for Daniel moving uphill.

Then, for each x, check if there exists a path for Qingshan that is longer than Daniel's possible path lengths for all possible y choices.

But this is vague.

Let's think of the following:

For each x, compute:

- left_decreasing: the maximum number of steps Qingshan can take to the left of x (moving to lower values).

- right_decreasing: the maximum number of steps Qingshan can take to the right of x (moving to lower values).

Daniel can choose to block one of these directions. So the minimal possible maximum steps Qingshan can take is the minimum of left_decreasing and right_decreasing.

But if one of the directions is blocked, Qingshan can take the other direction. So the minimal possible steps she can take is the maximum of left_decreasing and right_decreasing (if one is blocked, she takes the other, which has the maximum steps).

Wait, perhaps this is the key. Daniel will choose to block the direction that has the longest path. So Qingshan's path length is the remaining direction's path length. So for x to be valid, the other direction's path length must be even or odd in a certain way.

Alternatively, if Qingshan has a path length that is greater than Daniel's possible path length for all y choices, she wins.

But how to model this.

Alternative approach inspired by the sample:

For each x, the key is to determine whether there exists a direction (left or right) that Qingshan can take such that even if Daniel blocks the other direction, Qingshan's path in the chosen direction leads her to win.

Thus, the steps for x to be valid are:

- Qingshan has at least one direction (left or right) where she can take steps that are longer than Daniel's possible steps in any of his directions.

But how to compute this.

Another idea: for each x, Qingshan's best move is to choose the direction where the path length is maximum. Daniel will choose a y that blocks this direction. But if the other direction's path length is still sufficient for Qingshan to win, then x is valid.

Alternatively, if Qingshan has a path in at least one direction that is longer than the maximum path Daniel can take in any direction, then x is valid.

But how to compute this.

Let's think of the following:

For each x, compute:

- the maximum number of steps Qingshan can take to the left (l_q) and right (r_q).

- for each possible y (blocking one direction), Qingshan can take the other direction. So for each x, Daniel can choose to block either left or right (if possible).

But Daniel's choice of y depends on the possible directions. For example, if x has both left and right directions available (i.e., p[x-1] < p[x] and p[x+1] < p[x]), then Daniel can block one of them by choosing y=x-1 or y=x+1.

So for x to be valid, even after blocking one direction, the other direction's path must allow Qingshan to win.

So for x to be valid:

If blocking left (y=x-1), then the right path must be sufficient.

If blocking right (y=x+1), then the left path must be sufficient.

But Daniel can choose to block whichever direction is better for him.

Thus, for x to be valid, both of the following must hold:

- blocking left (y=x-1) implies that Qingshan can win by taking the right path.

- blocking right (y=x+1) implies that Qingshan can win by taking the left path.

If either of these is not possible, then Daniel can block that direction and make Qingshan lose.

But this is only the case if Daniel can choose to block that direction. For example, if x has no left direction (p[x-1] > p[x]), then Daniel cannot block the left direction.

Thus, the approach is:

For each x:

1. Determine the left and right directions available for Qingshan's first move.

2. For each available direction, check if Daniel can block it (i.e., choose y as the adjacent position in that direction).

3. For each such possible block, compute whether Qingshan can win by taking the other direction.

4. Additionally, consider other possible y choices that Daniel might make (not just adjacent ones), but it's likely that Daniel's optimal choice is to block one of the available directions.

But how to handle this.

The problem is that Daniel can choose any y !=x. However, the best strategy for Daniel is to choose a y that is as close to x as possible to block Qingshan's moves. Hence, the optimal y for Daniel is to block one of Qingshan's possible initial directions.

Thus, for each x, Daniel's best possible y is one of the adjacent positions (x-1 or x+1), if those positions are valid for Qingshan's initial moves.

So, for x, compute the left and right possible initial moves. For each possible initial move direction (left or right), Daniel can choose y to block that direction. So Qingshan must have a winning strategy in the remaining direction.

So for x to be valid:

- If both left and right directions are available for Qingshan's initial move, then Daniel can block either, and Qingshan must be able to win in the other direction.

- If only one direction is available, Daniel can block it, making Qingshan unable to move. Hence, x is invalid.

- If no directions are available, Qingshan can't move and loses.

But this is not entirely correct. For example, even if Daniel blocks one direction, Qingshan might have a path in the other direction that allows her to win.

Thus, for x to be valid:

- There exists at least one direction (left or right) where Qingshan's path in that direction allows her to win, and Daniel cannot block that direction.

But Daniel can block any direction. So for x to be valid, Qingshan must have a path in at least one direction that allows her to win, even if Daniel blocks the other direction.

But how to model this.

Perhaps the following steps:

For each x:

- Compute left_length: the number of steps Qingshan can take to the left from x, moving to lower values.

- Compute right_length: the number of steps to the right.

- Compute whether the maximum of left_length and right_length is greater than any possible Daniel's path when blocking the other direction.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for each x:

- Check if there exists a direction (left or right) where Qingshan can move, and in that direction, the path length is strictly greater than the maximum path Daniel can take in any direction.

But again, not sure.

Another idea: the game is a turn-based game. The player who can't move first loses. So if Qingshan can make more moves than Daniel, she wins.

But the game alternates between players, so the number of moves each can make determines the winner.

For example:

- If Qingshan can make k moves and Daniel can make l moves:

- If k > l: Qingshan wins.

- If k < l: Daniel wins.

- If k == l: Daniel wins (since Qingshan runs out first).

But this is only true if all moves are possible. However, the players' moves are interdependent; Qingshan's moves may block Daniel's options, and vice versa.

Thus, this line of thinking might not be directly applicable.

But for large n, perhaps we can precompute for each x the maximum possible steps Qingshan can take (left and right) and for each y the maximum steps Daniel can take (upwards), and compare these steps.

But this is not straightforward.

An alternative approach is to model the game as follows:

Qingshan's best strategy is to choose the longest possible path. Daniel's best strategy is to choose the y that blocks Qingshan's longest path and allows him to take the longest possible path himself.

So for x to be valid:

The maximum length of Qingshan's path (when Daniel blocks the other direction) must be greater than the maximum length of Daniel's path (when he chooses his best possible y).

But how to compute this.

Let's think of it this way:

For x, suppose Qingshan's left and right paths are l and r.

Daniel can block either left or right, forcing Qingshan to take the other.

So Qingshan's path length after blocking is max(l, r).

Wait, no. If Daniel blocks left, Qingshan must take right (if possible). So the path length is r.

Similarly, if he blocks right, path length is l.

So Qingshan's path length after blocking is min(l, r) if both are available. Because Daniel will block the longer path. But if one is longer than the other, Daniel will block the longer path, forcing Qingshan to take the shorter one.

Wait, no. For example, if l > r, Daniel will block left, forcing Qingshan to take right, which is shorter. So Qingshan's path length is r. Which is min(l, r). No, min(l, r) is r in this case. So Qingshan's path length after blocking is min(l, r) if Daniel can block the longer path.

But in this case, Qingshan's path length is min(l, r).

But how does this compare to Daniel's possible path length.

Daniel's path depends on his initial y.

But Daniel's path is the maximum length path he can take from his initial y.

So for x to be valid, Qingshan's path length (after blocking) must be greater than the maximum Daniel's path length for any possible y.

But this is not tractable for large n.

Thus, the key insight is to precompute for each x:

- The maximum number of steps Qingshan can take in any direction after blocking.

- The maximum number of steps Daniel can take from any possible y.

But this is not feasible for n=1e5.

Alternative idea inspired by the sample:

The valid x's are those that are peaks (higher than both neighbors), and the path in one direction is strictly longer than the path in the other direction. But this is just a hypothesis.

Alternatively, x must be a peak (higher than both neighbors), and the path in one direction is longer than any path Daniel can take from any possible y.

But how to compute this.

Another observation: Daniel's path can only be along increasing values. So for any y, the maximum path Daniel can take is the length of the longest increasing path starting at y.

Similarly, Qingshan's path is the longest decreasing path from x, but possibly blocked by y.

So, precompute for each position the length of the longest increasing path to the left and right (for Daniel), and the longest decreasing path to the left and right (for Qingshan).

But how to compute these.

For Qingshan's longest decreasing path:

For each position i, compute:

left_decrease[i] = 1 + left_decrease[i-1] if p[i-1] < p[i], else 1.

Similarly for right_decrease[i] = 1 + right_decrease[i+1] if p[i+1] < p[i], else 1.

This can be computed in O(n) time.

For Daniel's longest increasing path:

left_increase[i] = 1 + left_increase[i-1] if p[i-1] > p[i], else 1.

right_increase[i] = 1 + right_increase[i+1] if p[i+1] > p[i], else 1.

But wait, Daniel can move to any higher adjacent position, which can be left or right.

So for Daniel's path, the maximum length starting at y is the maximum of the left_increase[y] and right_increase[y].

Thus, for each y, the maximum Daniel's path length is max(left_increase[y], right_increase[y]).

So the idea is:

For each x, Daniel can choose any y !=x. For x to be valid, for all possible y, the maximum Daniel's path length from y must be less than the minimal Qingshan's path length after blocking.

But this is not feasible to compute for all y.

Thus, the optimal approach would be to find for each x:

1. Qingshan's possible directions (left and/or right).

2. Daniel's best choice of y is to block the direction that gives Qingshan the longest path.

3. After blocking, Qingshan's path is the other direction.

4. Daniel's maximum possible path length from any y (excluding x) must be less than Qingshan's path length.

But again, this is not directly applicable.

But considering that Daniel's best choice is to block the longest path, then Qingshan's path is the other direction.

So for x to be valid:

After blocking, Qingshan's path length (max_decrease) must be greater than Daniel's maximum possible path length from any y.

But how to find the maximum Daniel's path length from any y !=x.

But this is impossible for large n. So perhaps we can precompute the maximum Daniel's path length for all positions, and then for x, the maximum Daniel's path length among all y !=x.

The maximum Daniel's path length overall is the maximum of max_increase[y] for all y.

So for x to be valid, Qingshan's minimal path (after blocking) must be greater than the overall maximum Daniel's path.

But this is not correct. Because Daniel can choose any y, and his path length is max_increase[y]. So even if there exists a y with a large max_increase[y], Daniel can choose that y.

Thus, the minimal Qingshan's path length (after blocking) must be greater than the maximum max_increase[y] for any y !=x.

But this is not feasible because the maximum max_increase[y] for all y can be O(n), and checking for each x would be O(1) if we know the global maximum.

But how.

Alternatively, the answer is 0 unless Qingshan's minimal path after blocking is greater than the global maximum of Daniel's path lengths.

So steps:

1. Precompute left_decrease and right_decrease for each x.

2. Precompute left_increase and right_increase for each y, and compute max_increase[y] = max(left_increase[y], right_increase[y]).

3. Find the global_max_increase = max(max_increase[y] for all y).

4. For each x:

   a. Compute the directions available (left and/or right).

   b. Daniel will block the direction which gives Qingshan the longer path. So Qingshan's path length after blocking is the shorter of left_decrease[x] and right_decrease[x].

   c. If the shorter path is longer than global_max_increase, then x is valid.

   d. Also, if x is a peak (both directions available), and the longer path is > global_max_increase, but the shorter path is <= global_max_increase, then Daniel can block the longer path, making Qingshan's path length the shorter one, which is <= global_max_increase. So x is invalid.

So for x to be valid, the minimal path after blocking (the shorter of left and right) must be > global_max_increase.

But how.

Alternatively, the minimal path after blocking is the minimal of left and right (if both are available). But this is only the case when both directions are available.

For example, if x has both left and right directions available, then Daniel can block the longer path, leaving the shorter. So the path length is the shorter of the two.

If x has only one direction available, Daniel blocks it, and path length is 0. So x is invalid.

Thus, for x to be valid:

Either:

1. x is a peak (both directions available), and the minimal of left_decrease and right_decrease is greater than global_max_increase.

OR

2. x is not a peak but has at least one direction available, but Daniel can't block it (which is not possible because Daniel can choose y to block it).

So this suggests that the only possible valid x's are those that are peaks, and the minimal of their left and right decrease lengths is greater than the global_max_increase.

Thus, the steps are:

- Precompute left_decrease, right_decrease for all x.

- Precompute left_increase, right_increase for all y.

- Compute max_increase for each y, and global_max_increase.

- For each x:

   - Check if x is a peak (p[x] > left neighbor and p[x] > right neighbor).

   - If yes, compute the minimal of left_decrease[x] and right_decrease[x].

   - If this minimal value > global_max_increase: x is valid.

Count the number of such x's.

But why this works:

For a peak x, Daniel can block the longer direction, forcing Qingshan to use the shorter path. If this shorter path's length is greater than the global_max_increase, then Qingshan's path will outlast Daniel's maximum possible path, leading to her win.

But how does this compare to Daniel's path.

Wait, the idea is that Qingshan's path length after blocking is the shorter of the two directions. This must be greater than the maximum possible Daniel's path length (global_max_increase).

In this case, even if Daniel chooses the y that allows him the longest path, Qingshan's path is longer, so she wins.

But how?

The game alternates turns. Qingshan moves first. So if Qingshan's path length is k, and Daniel's is l:

- If k > l: Qingshan wins (since after l moves, Daniel can't move, and Qingshan still has k - l moves left, but she already took l steps).

- If k <= l: Daniel wins.

So the key is to compare Qingshan's path length (after blocking) with Daniel's maximum possible path length.

Thus, if Qingshan's path length (after blocking) is greater than the maximum possible Daniel's path length, she will win.

So for each peak x, if the minimal of left and right decrease lengths is greater than global_max_increase, then x is valid.

Otherwise, x is invalid.

Thus, the algorithm is:

1. Compute for each position:

   a. left_decrease: length of longest decreasing path to the left.

   b. right_decrease: length of longest decreasing path to the right.

2. Compute for each position:

   a. left_increase: length of longest increasing path to the left.

   b. right_increase: length of longest increasing path to the right.

3. Compute max_increase for each position as max(left_increase, right_increase).

4. Find the global_max_increase as the maximum of all max_increase.

5. For each x:

   a. Check if x is a peak (p[x] > left neighbor and p[x] > right neighbor).

   b. If it's a peak, compute the minimal of left_decrease[x] and right_decrease[x].

   c. If this minimal value > global_max_increase: count x as valid.

6. The answer is the number of such valid x's.

Let's test this with the first sample input.

Sample 1:

n=5, p=[1,2,5,4,3].

left_decrease:

For each i:

i=1: left_decrease is 1 (no left neighbor).

i=2: p[1]=1 <2 → left_decrease[2] = left_decrease[1] +1=2.

i=3: p[2]=2 <5 → left_decrease[3] = left_decrease[2] +1=3.

i=4: p[3]=5>4 → left_decrease[4] =1.

i=5: p[4]=4>3 → left_decrease[5] =1.

right_decrease:

i=5: 1.

i=4: p[5]=3 <4 → right_decrease[4]=1+right_decrease[5]=2.

i=3: p[4]=4 <5 → right_decrease[3] =1+ right_decrease[4] =3.

i=2: p[3]=5>2 → right_decrease[2]=1.

i=1: p[2]=2>1 → right_decrease[1]=1.

For x=3 (the peak):

left_decrease=3, right_decrease=3. So minimal is 3.

global_max_increase is the maximum of max_increase for all y.

Compute max_increase for each y:

left_increase and right_increase.

left_increase:

i=1: 1.

i=2: p[1]=1 <2 → left_increase[2]=1.

i=3: p[2]=2 <5 → left_increase[3]=1.

i=4: p[3]=5>4 → left_increase[4]=left_increase[3]+1=2.

i=5: p[4]=4<3 → left_increase[5]=1.

right_increase:

i=1: p[2]=2>1 → right_increase[1] = right_increase[2] +1.

i=2: p[3]=5>2 → right_increase[2] = right_increase[3] +1.

i=3: p[4]=4 <5 → right_increase[3] =1.

i=4: p[5]=3 <4 → right_increase[4]=1.

i=5: 1.

So:

For i=1:

left_increase[1] =1.

right_increase[1] =1 + right_increase[2] =1 + (1 + right_increase[3}) → right_increase[2] = 1+1=2 → right_increase[1] =1+2=3.

max_increase[1] = max(1,3) =3.

For i=2:

left_increase[2]=1.

right_increase[2]=1 + right_increase[3}=1+1=2.

max_increase[2] =2.

For i=3:

left_increase=1.

right_increase=1.

max_increase=1.

For i=4:

left_increase=2.

right_increase=1.

max_increase=2.

For i=5:

left_increase=1.

right_increase=1.

max_increase=1.

global_max_increase is 3 (from y=1).

Qingshan's minimal path for x=3 is 3.

3 > 3? No. 3 is not greater than global_max_increase of3. So x=3 is invalid.

But according to the sample, x=3 is valid. So this suggests that the algorithm is incorrect.

Hmm. So there's a problem with this approach.

Thus, this indicates that the approach of comparing Qingshan's path length after blocking to the global maximum increase is incorrect.

Thus, another approach is needed.

Alternative idea inspired by the sample analysis:

When x is a peak and the minimal path after blocking is greater than or equal to the maximum possible Daniel's path, but the parity is such that Qingshan's moves are enough.

But how to model parity.

The key is that Qingshan and Daniel alternate turns. So the player who has more moves will win.

For example:

- Qingshan has k moves, Daniel has l moves.

- If k > l: Qingshan wins (she makes the last move).

- If k <= l: Daniel wins (she can't make a move after l steps).

Thus, for x to be valid, after blocking, Qingshan's path length must be strictly greater than Daniel's maximum path length from any y.

In the first sample, x=3's minimal path is 3. Daniel's maximum path is 3 (from y=1). 3 is not strictly greater than 3. So x=3 is invalid. But the sample says it's valid. Thus, this approach is incorrect.

Thus, the initial approach is flawed.

This suggests that the parity of the path lengths also matters.

But why in the first sample, even though Qingshan's path length is 3 and Daniel's is 3, Qingshan wins.

In that scenario, Qingshan's path length is 3 steps, Daniel's is 3 steps.

They alternate moves:

Qingshan moves 3 times, Daniel moves 3 times.

Qingshan moves first:

Q1, D1, Q2, D2, Q3, D3. After this, Daniel has no more moves, and Qingshan has no moves left. But Qingshan made the last move. So Daniel can't move and loses. So Qingshan wins.

Ah! Because even if the path lengths are equal, Qingshan wins because she moves first.

So the correct condition is that Qingshan's path length must be greater than or equal to Daniel's path length.

Because:

- If Qingshan's path length > Daniel's: she wins.

- If Qingshan's path length == Daniel's: she still wins, because she moves first.

Thus, the correct condition is that Qingshan's path length after blocking must be >= Daniel's maximum path length.

So, for x to be valid:

After blocking, Qingshan's path length (k) >= Daniel's maximum possible path length (l).

In this case, Qingshan will win.

Thus, the algorithm should be:

For each peak x:

Compute k = min(left_decrease[x], right_decrease[x]).

If k >= global_max_increase: x is valid.

In the first sample, k=3, global_max_increase=3. So 3 >=3 → valid.

Thus, the algorithm should count such x.

So the corrected algorithm is:

1. Precompute left_decrease and right_decrease for each x.

2. Precompute max_increase for each y.

3. Compute global_max_increase as the maximum of max_increase for all y.

4. For each x that is a peak (both directions available):

   a. Compute k = min(left_decrease[x], right_decrease[x]).

   b. If k >= global_max_increase: count x.

Otherwise, no.

This would explain why the first sample's x=3 is valid.

Thus, the steps are:

- Find all peaks.

- For each peak, compute the minimal of left_decrease and right_decrease.

- Compare this minimal to the global_max_increase.

- Count the number of peaks where the minimal >= global_max_increase.

Thus, this is the correct approach.

Now, let's test this with the first sample.

Sample 1:

global_max_increase is3.

x=3 is a peak, left_decrease=3, right_decrease=3. Minimal is3.

3 >=3 → valid.

Thus, count 1.

Sample 2:

Input:

7

1 2 4 6 5 3 7

Compute left_decrease, right_decrease.

Left_decrease:

i=1: 1.

i=2: p[1]=1 <2 → left_decrease[2]=2.

i=3: p[2]=2 <4 → left_decrease[3]=3.

i=4: p[3]=4 <6 → left_decrease[4]=4.

i=5: p[4]=6>5 → left_decrease[5]=1.

i=6: p[5]=5>3 → left_decrease[6]=1.

i=7: p[6]=3 <7 → left_decrease[7]= left_decrease[6]+1=2.

Right_decrease:

i=7:1.

i=6: p[7]=7>3 → right_decrease=1.

i=5: p[6]=3 <5 → right_decrease[5]=1 + right_decrease[6] =2.

i=4: p[5]=5 <6 → right_decrease[4]=1 + right_decrease[5] =3.

i=3: p[4]=6>4 → right_decrease[3] =1.

i=2: p[3]=4>2 → right_decrease[2]=1.

i=1: p[2]=2>1 → right_decrease[1]=1.

Peaks:

Check if each i is a peak.

i=1: no.

i=2: no.

i=3: p[3]=4. left neighbor is2, right neighbor is6. 4<6 → no.

i=4: p=6. left neighbor 4 <6, right neighbor5 <6. So yes, peak.

i=5: p=5. right neighbor3 <5. left neighbor6>5 → no.

i=6: p=3. right neighbor7>3 → no.

i=7: no.

So the only peak is i=4.

left_decrease[4]=4, right_decrease[4]=3. minimal is3.

Compute global_max_increase.

For each y, compute max_increase[y].

left_increase and right_increase.

Compute left_increase:

i=1: 1.

i=2: p[1]=1 <2 → left_increase=1.

i=3: p[2]=2 <4 → left_increase=1.

i=4: p[3]=4 <6 → left_increase=1.

i=5: p[4]=6>5 → left_increase= left_increase[4]+1 = 2.

i=6: p[5]=5>3 → left_increase= left_increase[5]+1=3.

i=7: p[6]=3 <7 → left_increase=1.

Right_increase:

i=1: p[2]=2>1 → right_increase[1] = 1 + right_increase[2].

i=2: p[3]=4>2 → right_increase[2] =1 + right_increase[3].

i=3: p[4]=6>4 → right_increase[3] =1 + right_increase[4].

i=4: p[5]=5 <6 → right_increase[4] =1.

i=5: p[6]=3 <5 → right_increase[5] =1.

i=6: p[7]=7>3 → right_increase[6] =1 + right_increase[7] =2.

i=7: 1.

So:

max_increase for each y:

i=1: left_increase=1, right_increase=1 + (right_increase[2]).

right_increase[2] =1 + right_increase[3] =1 + (1+ right_increase[4}).

right_increase[4}=1. So right_increase[3}=1+1=2. right_increase[2}=1+2=3. right_increase[1}=1+3=4. So max_increase[1}=4.

i=2: left_increase=1, right_increase=3. max=3.

i=3: left_increase=1, right_increase=2. max=2.

i=4: left_increase=1, right_increase=1. max=1.

i=5: left_increase=2, right_increase=1. max=2.

i=6: left_increase=3, right_increase=2. max=3.

i=7: left_increase=1, right_increase=1. max=1.

global_max_increase is max(4,3,2,1,2,3,1) =4.

The peak i=4: minimal path is3.

3 <4 → not valid. So answer is0.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the algorithm seems correct.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Precompute left_decrease and right_decrease for each position.

2. Precompute left_increase and right_increase for each position.

3. Compute max_increase for each position and find the global_max_increase.

4. For each peak (positions where both left and right are smaller), compute the minimal of left_decrease and right_decrease. If this minimal is >= global_max_increase, count it.

Thus, the code will be:

Implement steps 1-4.

Now, code implementation.

First, compute left_decrease:

left_decrease[0] =1.

For i from1 to n-1:

if p[i-1] < p[i], left_decrease[i] = left_decrease[i-1] +1.

else left_decrease[i] =1.

Similarly for right_decrease:

right_decrease[n-1] =1.

for i from n-2 down to 0:

if p[i+1] < p[i], right_decrease[i] = right_decrease[i+1] +1.

else right_decrease[i] =1.

Then, compute left_increase and right_increase.

left_increase[0] =1.

for i from1 to n-1:

if p[i-1] > p[i], left_increase[i] = left_increase[i-1]+1.

else left_increase[i] =1.

right_increase[n-1] =1.

for i from n-2 down to 0:

if p[i+1] > p[i], right_increase[i] = right_increase[i+1] +1.

else right_increase[i] =1.

Then, compute max_increase for each position.

global_max_increase is the maximum of all max_increase.

Then, for each position i, check if it's a peak (i.e., (i ==0 or p[i-1] < p[i]) and (i ==n-1 or p[i+1] < p[i])).

If yes, compute k = min(left_decrease[i], right_decrease[i]).

if k >= global_max_increase: count +=1.

Finally, output count.

Now, implement this in Python.

Test case 1:

n=5, p = [1,2,5,4,3].

left_decrease:

i=0:1.

i=1:2 (p[0]<p[1]).

i=2:3 (p[1]<p[2]).

i=3:1 (p[2]>p[3]).

i=4:1.

right_decrease:

i=4:1.

i=3: 2 (p[4]<p[3}).

i=2:3 (p[3]<p[2}).

i=1:1.

i=0:1.

peaks: i=2 (p=5).

k = min(3,3) =3.

global_max_increase is4 (from i=0 in test case 1? Wait, no.

Wait, in test case 1:

left_increase:

i=0:1.

i=1:1 (p[0] <p[1} → left_increase[1}=1).

i=2:1 (p[1}<p[2} → left_increase[2} is 1).

i=3:2 (p[2}>p[3} → left_increase[3} = left_increase[2}+1=2.

i=4:1 (p[3} >p[4} → left_increase[4} = left_increase[3}+1=3.

right_increase:

i=4:1.

i=3:1 (p[4} <p[3} → right_increase[3} =1.

i=2:1 (p[3} <p[2} → right_increase[2} =1.

i=1:3.

Because:

right_increase[1} is computed as follows:

p[1} is2, p[2}=5>2 → right_increase[1} =1 + right_increase[2} =1+1=2.

Wait, no:

right_increase is computed from right to left.

For i from n-2 down to 0.

In test case1, n=5.

i=3: p[4}=3 <4 → right_increase[3}=1.

i=2: p[3}=4 <5 → right_increase[2}=1.

i=1: p[2}=5>2 → right_increase[1}=1 + right_increase[2} =1+1=2.

i=0: p[1}=2>1 → right_increase[0} =1 + right_increase[1} =3.

Thus, max_increase:

i=0: max(left_increase[0}=1, right_increase[0}=3) →3.

i=1: max(left_increase[1}=1, right_increase[1}=2) →2.

i=2: max(1,1) →1.

i=3: max(2,1) →2.

i=4: max(3,1) →3.

Thus, global_max_increase is3.

For peak i=2 (0-based), k=3.

3 >=3 → valid. So count is1.

Thus, correct.

Now, code.

Read n, read p.

Compute left_decrease:

left_decrease = [1] * n.

for i in range(1, n):

 if p[i] > p[i-1]:

     left_decrease[i] = left_decrease[i-1] +1

 else:

     left_decrease[i] =1.

Similarly for right_decrease.

left_increase:

left_increase = [1]*n.

for i in range(1, n):

 if p[i-1] > p[i]:

     left_increase[i] = left_increase[i-1] +1

 else:

     left_increase[i] =1.

right_increase:

right_increase = [1]*n.

for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):

 if p[i+1] > p[i]:

     right_increase[i] = right_increase[i+1] +1

 else:

     right_increase[i] =1.

max_increase = [max(left_increase[i], right_increase[i]) for i in range(n)].

global_max = max(max_increase).

count =0.

for i in range(n):

 left_ok = (i ==0) or (p[i-1] < p[i])

 right_ok = (i ==n-1) or (p[i+1] < p[i])

 if left_ok and right_ok:

     k = min(left_decrease[i], right_decrease[i])

     if k >= global_max:

         count +=1

print(count)

Yes, this should work.

Testing this code with the first sample:

Sample 1:

n=5.

p=[1,2,5,4,3].

left_decrease: [1,2,3,1,1].

right_decrease: [1,1,3,2,1].

left_ok and right_ok for i=2 (5):

left_ok: i=2, p[1]=2 <5.

right_ok: p[3]=4 <5.

Thus, peak.

left_decrease[2] is3.

right_decrease[2] is3.

k=3.

global_max is3.

3 >=3 → count=1.

Sample 2:

n=7.

p=[1,2,4,6,5,3,7].

left_decrease:

i=0:1.

i=1:2.

i=2:3.

i=3:4.

i=4:1.

i=5:1.

i=6:2.

right_decrease:

i=6:1.

i=5:1.

i=4:2.

i=3:3.

i=2:1.

i=1:1.

i=0:1.

Peak is i=3 (6).

left_decrease[3]=4.

right_decrease[3]=3.

k=3.

global_max is4.

3<4 → not counted. So count=0.

Thus, the code should work.
