Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest time Polycarp can sleep without any alarms going off. The alarms are daily, so they repeat every day. The key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive alarms when considering the circular nature of a day (since after 23:59 comes 00:00 again). 

First, I'll need to parse the input times and convert them into minutes since the start of the day. For example, 00:00 is 0 minutes, 01:00 is 60, etc. Then, I'll sort these times so that I can check the gaps between consecutive alarms. But since the times are on a circular timeline, the largest gap could be between the last alarm of the day and the first one of the next day (wrapping around midnight).

So the steps are:

1. Read all the alarm times and convert them to total minutes.
2. Sort them in ascending order.
3. Calculate the differences between consecutive alarms. Also, the gap from the last alarm to the first one plus 24*60 (since that's the next day's alarm).
4. The maximum gap among these differences minus one (because each alarm rings for one minute, so the sleep can start right after one alarm ends and ends when the next starts. For example, between alarm at 60 and 120, the gap is 60 minutes, but the possible sleep time is 59 minutes (from 60+1 to 120-1). Wait, no. Wait, the alarm starts at the beginning of the minute and rings for exactly one minute. So if an alarm is at 05:43, it's active during minute 05:43. So the next minute is 05:44. So the time between two alarms is the difference in their start times. The sleep can be from the end of one alarm (which is the next minute) to the start of the next alarm. So the sleep duration between two alarms at A and B (where B is the next alarm after A) is B - A -1 minutes. Because the alarm at A lasts until A+1. So the sleep can start at A+1, and end at B. So the duration is (B - (A+1)) + 0? Wait, if B is the next alarm, then the time between A and B is B - A minutes. But during A's minute, the alarm is ringing, so the available time to sleep is between A+1 and B-1 (inclusive?), but how?

Wait, let's think again. Let's take two alarms: one at 0 minutes (00:00) and another at 2 minutes (00:02). So the first alarm rings from 0 to 1 (the first minute), and the second rings from 2 to 3. The time between them is 1 minute (from 1 to 2). So the sleep duration between them is 2 - 1 = 1 minute. So the maximum possible sleep between these two alarms is (B - A -1) minutes. Because between the end of the first alarm (A+1) and the start of the next (B) is B - (A+1) minutes. So yes, the gap between two consecutive alarms (sorted) would be B - A -1. 

But wait, if the alarms are sorted, then the next alarm after A is B. So the time between them is B - A minutes. But during that interval, the first minute is A's alarm, then there's B - A -1 minutes of possible sleep. Because after A's alarm ends (at A+1), the next possible time to start sleeping is A+1. The next alarm starts at B. So the duration is B - (A+1) minutes. So yes, B - A -1.

So when calculating the gaps between each pair of consecutive alarms (after sorting), we need to subtract 1 from each difference. Then, the maximum of these values is the answer. But also, we have to consider the wrap-around case. For example, if the last alarm is at time X, and the first is at Y the next day. The difference here is (Y + 24*60 - X) - 1. Because X's next alarm is the next day's Y. So the time between them is Y + 24*60 - X, and then subtract 1 for the same reason.

So steps:

- Convert all times to minutes, sort them.
- Compute the gaps between consecutive alarms (after sorting) as (alarms[i+1] - alarms[i] - 1).
- Compute the wrap-around gap as (alarms[0] + 24*60 - alarms[-1] -1).
- The maximum of all these gaps is the answer.

Wait, but the wrap-around case is when the last alarm is followed by the first alarm of the next day. So for example, sorted list is [a1, a2, ..., an]. The gaps are a2 -a1 -1, a3 -a2 -1, ..., and then (a1 + 24*60 - an) -1. So all possible gaps.

So the maximum of these is the answer.

Once I have this maximum gap, I need to convert it back into hours and minutes. For example, 1439 minutes (23:59) is 23*60 +59=1439. So if the maximum gap is 1439, then output 23:59.

So the steps for code:

Read n.

Read n lines, parse each into hh:mm, convert to total minutes.

Sort the list.

Compute the differences between consecutive elements, subtract 1.

Compute the wrap-around difference (first element + 1440 - last element) -1.

Take the maximum of all these.

Then, convert this maximum into hh:mm format.

Wait, but if all gaps are zero? Well, the problem states that all alarm times are distinct, but n can be 1. For example, the first sample input where n=1. Then the gap is (a0 + 1440 - a0 -1) = 1440 -1 = 1439. Which is correct.

So for n=1, the maximum gap is 1439, which is 23:59.

So code steps:

Read n.

Then read n times, convert to minutes. For example, "05:43" is 5*60 +43=343.

Sort the list.

Compute all consecutive gaps.

Then compute the wrap-around gap.

Find the maximum among all.

Convert maximum to hh and mm.

Edge cases: when n=0? No, the constraints say nâ‰¥1.

Another example: the second sample input:

4 alarms. The times are:

22:00 â†’ 22*60=1320 +0=1320.

03:21 â†’ 3*60+21= 201.

16:03 â†’ 16*60+3= 963.

09:59 â†’ 9*60+59= 599.

Sorting these gives 201, 599, 963, 1320.

Consecutive gaps:

599-201 -1 = 397.

963-599 -1= 363.

1320-963-1= 356.

Then the wrap-around gap is (201 +1440 -1320) -1 = (201 +1440=1641 -1320=321) -1 =320.

So the gaps are 397, 363, 356, 320. The maximum is 397. Which is 6 hours 37 minutes (6*60=360 +37=397). So the output is 06:37. Which matches the sample.

So the code seems correct.

Now, how to implement this in Python.

First, parsing the input.

For each time string in the input, split into hh and mm.

Then, total minutes is hh*60 + mm.

Once all are parsed, sort them.

Then compute the gaps.

For n=1, the consecutive gaps are none, and the wrap-around is (alarm[0] +1440 - alarm[0] -1) =1439.

So code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    times = []
    for _ in range(n):
        s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()
        hh, mm = map(int, s.split(':'))
        times.append(hh * 60 + mm)
    times.sort()
    max_gap = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        current = times[i] - times[i-1] - 1
        if current > max_gap:
            max_gap = current
    wrap = (times[0] + 1440 - times[-1] - 1)
    if wrap > max_gap:
        max_gap = wrap
    h, m = divmod(max_gap, 60)
    print(f"{h:02d}:{m:02d}", file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\

22:00
03:21
16:03
09:59
""",
            "output": \
"""\
06:37
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Sample input 2:

4

22:00 â†’ 1320.

03:21 â†’ 201.

16:03 â†’ 963.

09:59 â†’ 599.

Sorted list: 201, 599, 963, 1320.

Consecutive gaps: 599-201-1=397; 963-599-1=363; 1320-963-1=356. Wrap_diff is (201 +1440 -1320) -1 = (1641 -1320) =321, -1 â†’320. Max is 397 â†’ 6*60 +37=397 â†’ 06:37. Correct.

So code works.

Another test case: n=2, times 23:59 (1439) and 00:00 (0). Sorted list is [0, 1439]. Consecutive gaps: 1439-0-1=1438. Wrap_diff is (0 +1440 -1439) -1 = 1-1=0. Max is 1438 â†’ 23h58m.

Thus, code output is 23:58.

But according to the problem's first example, when there's only one alarm, the output is 23:59, which is correct. So code handles that.

Thus, the code is correct.
