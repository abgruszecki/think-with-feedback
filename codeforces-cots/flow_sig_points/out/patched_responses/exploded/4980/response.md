Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest time Polycarp can sleep without any alarms going off. The alarms are daily, so they repeat every day. The key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive alarms when considering the circular nature of a day (since after 23:59 comes 00:00 again). 

First, I'll need to parse the input times and convert them into minutes since the start of the day. For example, 00:00 is 0 minutes, 01:00 is 60, etc. Then, I'll sort these times so that I can check the gaps between consecutive alarms. But since the times are on a circular timeline, the largest gap could be between the last alarm of the day and the first one of the next day (wrapping around midnight).

So the steps are:

1. Read all the alarm times and convert them to total minutes.
2. Sort them in ascending order.
3. Calculate the differences between consecutive alarms. Also, the gap from the last alarm to the first one plus 24*60 (since that's the next day's alarm).
4. The maximum gap among these differences minus one (because each alarm rings for one minute, so the sleep can start right after one alarm ends and ends when the next starts. For example, between alarm at 60 and 120, the gap is 60 minutes, but the possible sleep time is 59 minutes (from 60+1 to 120-1). Wait, no. Wait, the alarm starts at the beginning of the minute and rings for exactly one minute. So if an alarm is at 05:43, it's active during minute 05:43. So the next minute is 05:44. So the time between two alarms is the difference in their start times. The sleep can be from the end of one alarm (which is the next minute) to the start of the next alarm. So the sleep duration between two alarms at A and B (where B is the next alarm after A) is B - A -1 minutes. Because the alarm at A lasts until A+1. So the sleep can start at A+1, and end at B. So the duration is (B - (A+1)) + 0? Wait, if B is the next alarm, then the time between A and B is B - A minutes. But during A's minute, the alarm is ringing, so the available time to sleep is between A+1 and B-1 (inclusive?), but how?

Wait, let's think again. Let's take two alarms: one at 0 minutes (00:00) and another at 2 minutes (00:02). So the first alarm rings from 0 to 1 (the first minute), and the second rings from 2 to 3. The time between them is 1 minute (from 1 to 2). So the sleep duration between them is 2 - 1 = 1 minute. So the maximum possible sleep between these two alarms is (B - A -1) minutes. Because between the end of the first alarm (A+1) and the start of the next (B) is B - (A+1) minutes. So yes, the gap between two consecutive alarms (sorted) would be B - A -1. 

But wait, if the alarms are sorted, then the next alarm after A is B. So the time between them is B - A minutes. But during that interval, the first minute is A's alarm, then there's B - A -1 minutes of possible sleep. Because after A's alarm ends (at A+1), the next possible time to start sleeping is A+1. The next alarm starts at B. So the duration is B - (A+1) minutes. So yes, B - A -1.

So when calculating the gaps between each pair of consecutive alarms (after sorting), we need to subtract 1 from each difference. Then, the maximum of these values is the answer. But also, we have to consider the wrap-around case. For example, if the last alarm is at time X, and the first is at Y the next day. The difference here is (Y + 24*60 - X) - 1. Because X's next alarm is the next day's Y. So the time between them is Y + 24*60 - X, and then subtract 1 for the same reason.

So steps:

- Convert all times to minutes, sort them.
- Compute the gaps between consecutive alarms (after sorting) as (alarms[i+1] - alarms[i] - 1).
- Compute the wrap-around gap as (alarms[0] + 24*60 - alarms[-1] -1).
- The maximum of all these gaps is the answer.

Wait, but the wrap-around case is when the last alarm is followed by the first alarm of the next day. So for example, sorted list is [a1, a2, ..., an]. The gaps are a2 -a1 -1, a3 -a2 -1, ..., and then (a1 + 24*60 - an) -1. So all possible gaps.

So the maximum of these is the answer.

Once I have this maximum gap, I need to convert it back into hours and minutes. For example, 1439 minutes (23:59) is 23*60 +59=1439. So if the maximum gap is 1439, then output 23:59.

So the steps for code:

Read n.

Read n lines, parse each into hh:mm, convert to total minutes.

Sort the list.

Compute the differences between consecutive elements, subtract 1.

Compute the wrap-around difference (first element + 1440 - last element) -1.

Take the maximum of all these.

Then, convert this maximum into hh:mm format.

Wait, but if all gaps are zero? Well, the problem states that all alarm times are distinct, but n can be 1. For example, the first sample input where n=1. Then the gap is (a0 + 1440 - a0 -1) = 1440 -1 = 1439. Which is correct.

So for n=1, the maximum gap is 1439, which is 23:59.

So code steps:

Read n.

Then read n times, convert to minutes. For example, "05:43" is 5*60 +43=343.

Sort the list.

Compute all consecutive gaps.

Then compute the wrap-around gap.

Find the maximum among all.

Convert maximum to hh and mm.

Edge cases: when n=0? No, the constraints say n≥1.

Another example: the second sample input:

4 alarms. The times are:

22:00 → 22*60=1320 +0=1320.

03:21 → 3*60+21= 201.

16:03 → 16*60+3= 963.

09:59 → 9*60+59= 599.

Sorting these gives 201, 599, 963, 1320.

Consecutive gaps:

599-201 -1 = 397.

963-599 -1= 363.

1320-963-1= 356.

Then the wrap-around gap is (201 +1440 -1320) -1 = (201 +1440=1641 -1320=321) -1 =320.

So the gaps are 397, 363, 356, 320. The maximum is 397. Which is 6 hours 37 minutes (6*60=360 +37=397). So the output is 06:37. Which matches the sample.

So the code seems correct.

Now, how to implement this in Python.

First, parsing the input.

For each time string in the input, split into hh and mm.

Then, total minutes is hh*60 + mm.

Once all are parsed, sort them.

Then compute the gaps.

For n=1, the consecutive gaps are none, and the wrap-around is (alarm[0] +1440 - alarm[0] -1) =1439.

So code:

n = int(input())

times = []

for _ in range(n):

    s = input().strip()

    hh, mm = map(int, s.split(':'))

    total = hh * 60 + mm

    times.append(total)

times.sort()

max_gap = 0

for i in range(1, n):

    diff = times[i] - times[i-1] -1

    if diff > max_gap:

        max_gap = diff

# handle wrap-around

wrap_diff = (times[0] + 1440 - times[-1]) -1

if wrap_diff > max_gap:

    max_gap = wrap_diff

# Now, convert max_gap into hh:mm.

hours = max_gap // 60

minutes = max_gap % 60

print(f"{hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}")

Wait, but in the first sample, the code:

times = [343] (since n=1). 

Loop from 1 to n=1, so no iterations. Then wrap_diff is (343 +1440 -343) -1= 1440 -1=1439. Which is correct.

Yes.

Another test case: the second sample. Let's see.

times after sorting: 201, 599, 963, 1320.

Consecutive gaps:

599-201-1=397, 963-599-1=363, 1320-963-1=356. So max is 397.

Wrap_diff: 201 +1440 =1641 -1320=321, 321-1=320. So the max is 397.

Which is 397 minutes → 6 hours 37 minutes → 06:37.

Yes.

So code seems to work.

Now, what about leading zeros in the output? The problem says to print hh as two digits, and mm as two digits. So for example, 5 hours and 3 minutes would be 05:03.

In Python, using f-strings with format specifiers like "{h:02d}" and "{m:02d}" will handle that.

So the code is correct.

Now, check possible edge cases.

Another example: n=2, times at 23:59 and 00:00.

After sorting, times are 23:59 (1439), 00:00 (0).

Consecutive gap: 0 -1439 -1 → which is negative. So the code would not process that because for i=1, the code would compute times[1] - times[0] which is 0 -1439 = -1439. Then subtract 1 gives -1440, which is negative, so the max_gap remains 0.

Then the wrap_diff is (0 +1440 -0) -1=1439. So the maximum is 1439. Which is correct. Because between 00:00 and 23:59 of the next day, the gap is 23:59 - 00:00 + 23h59m? Wait, no. Let's see.

Original times are 23:59 and 00:00.

When sorted, they are 0 and 1439.

Consecutive gaps:

times[1] - times[0] -1 = 1439 -0 -1 =1438.

Then wrap_diff is (0 +1440 -1439) -1= (1) -1=0.

So the maximum is 1438. Which is 23h 58m.

Wait, that's not right.

Wait, let me re-calculate.

If the two times are 23:59 (1439) and 00:00 (0).

Wait, after sorting, the times would be [0, 1439]?

No. Because 0 is 00:00 and 1439 is 23:59. So sorted, 0 comes first, then 1439.

So consecutive gaps:

times[1] - times[0] -1 → 1439 -0 -1 =1438. So that's 23h58m.

Then the wrap-around gap is (0 +1440 -1439) -1 → (1440 -1439) =1 → 1-1=0.

So the maximum is 1438. But according to the problem statement, the alarms repeat daily. So between 23:59 and 00:00, there's one minute of alarm (23:59's alarm), and the next alarm is 00:00's alarm, which starts at 0. So the time between the end of the 23:59 alarm (at 1440 minutes, which wraps to 0?) Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the day has 1440 minutes (24*60). So 23:59 is minute 1439. The next minute is 0. So if there's an alarm at 23:59 (1439), it rings for one minute (1439 to 1440 → but 1440 is 0 of the next day). Then the next alarm is at 0 (00:00), which rings from 0 to 1.

So the time between the end of the 23:59 alarm (which is at 1440, which is 0 next day) and the start of the 00:00 alarm (which is 0 next day) is zero. But that's not possible. Wait, perhaps in this case, when two alarms are consecutive (like 23:59 and 00:00), the gap between them is (0 -1439) + 1440 → but no, sorted times are 0 and 1439. So consecutive in sorted list is 0 and 1439. The difference is 1439-0 =1439. Then subtract 1 to get 1438. So the code's calculation gives 1438, which would be 23h58m. But the actual possible sleep time between these two alarms is from 0 (the end of 23:59's alarm) to 0 (the start of 00:00's alarm) minus 1 minute? No. Wait, the alarm at 1439 runs from 1439 to 1440 (which is 0 next day). The alarm at 0 runs from 0 to 1 next day. So the time between them is from 1440 (end of 1439's alarm) to 0 (start of 0's alarm) → but that's not possible. Wait, no. Because 1439 is the last minute of the day, then the next minute is 0 of the next day. So the alarm at 1439 ends at 0 (1440 mod 1440 is 0). The alarm at 0 starts at 0 and ends at 1. So the time between the two alarms is from 0 (the end of first) to 0 (the start of next) → 0-0=0 minutes. So the possible sleep time is 0 minutes. But according to the code's calculation, it's 1438. That's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the logic here. Let me think again.

Wait, when the sorted times are 0 and 1439. So the consecutive difference is 1439-0=1439. Subtract 1 gives 1438. But the actual gap between the two alarms (0 and 1439) is from the end of 0's alarm (1) to the start of 1439's alarm (1439). So the duration is 1439 -1 = 1438 minutes. Which matches the code's calculation.

But the wrap-around is (0 +1440 -1439) -1 → 1440-1439=1, subtract 1 → 0. So the maximum is 1438. But the actual longest sleep time would be 1438, which is between 0's alarm and 1439's alarm. But what about after 1439's alarm, before the next day's 0's alarm? Because 1439's alarm starts at 1439 and ends at 1440 (0 next day). Then the next alarm is 0 next day (same as 0 next day's alarm starts at 0). So between 1440 (0) and 0 (start of next alarm) is zero time. So the code is correct in this case.

But in this scenario, the maximum gap is between 0 and 1439 (1438 minutes), but the wrap-around is 0. So code gives 1438. However, perhaps the actual maximum is between 1439's end (1440) and next day's 0's start (0), which is 0 minutes. So the code's calculation for the wrap-around is correct.

So in this case, the code's logic is correct.

Wait, but let's take another example: two alarms at 00:00 and 00:01. So sorted times are 0 and 1.

Consecutive gap is 1-0-1=0. Wrap-around gap is (0 +1440 -1) -1= 1438.

So maximum is 1438. Which is correct. Because between the two alarms, there's no time (since 0's alarm ends at 1, and next alarm starts at 1). But between the 00:01 alarm and the next day's 00:00 alarm, the time is 1439 minutes (from 00:01 +1 minute to 00:00 next day). So 1440 - (1+1) = 1438? Wait, no.

Wait, the next day's 00:00 alarm starts at 1440 (which is 0 mod 1440). So the alarm at 00:01 (1) ends at 2. The next alarm is 0 next day (1440). So the gap between 2 and 1440 is 1438 minutes. So the code's calculation is correct.

Thus, the code seems correct.

Another example: n=2, times are 00:00 and 00:01.

The code calculates consecutive gap (1-0-1=0). Then wrap_diff is (0 +1440 -1) -1= 1440-1-1=1438. So the maximum is 1438, which is 23h58m. Which is correct.

So code seems to handle all cases correctly.

Now, implement this in Python.

The code should read n, then n lines, parse each time, convert to minutes. Sort the list. Compute the consecutive gaps, then the wrap-around gap. Take the maximum, convert to hh:mm.

The code as written earlier is correct.

Testing sample input 1:

Input:

1

05:43 → 343 minutes.

After sorting, list is [343].

Consecutive gaps: none. Then wrap_diff is (343 +1440 -343) -1 =1439. So output is 23:59. Correct.

Sample input 2:

4

22:00 → 1320.

03:21 → 201.

16:03 → 963.

09:59 → 599.

Sorted list: 201, 599, 963, 1320.

Consecutive gaps: 599-201-1=397; 963-599-1=363; 1320-963-1=356. Wrap_diff is (201 +1440 -1320) -1 = (1641 -1320) =321, -1 →320. Max is 397 → 6*60 +37=397 → 06:37. Correct.

So code works.

Another test case: n=2, times 23:59 (1439) and 00:00 (0). Sorted list is [0, 1439]. Consecutive gaps: 1439-0-1=1438. Wrap_diff is (0 +1440 -1439) -1 = 1-1=0. Max is 1438 → 23h58m.

Thus, code output is 23:58.

But according to the problem's first example, when there's only one alarm, the output is 23:59, which is correct. So code handles that.

Thus, the code is correct.
