Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to find the maximum cost of a subarray where the cost is the sum of the elements minus k multiplied by the ceiling of (length of the subarray divided by m). Oh right, and the empty subarray has a cost of zero. So we need to consider all possible subarrays, including the empty one, and find the maximum cost.

First, let's understand the problem. For any subarray from l to r (inclusive), the cost is sum(a[l..r]) - k * ceil((r-l+1)/m). Since the empty subarray is allowed, the maximum could be zero if all possible subarrays have negative costs.

But how do we efficiently compute this for large n (up to 3e5)? Brute-force checking all possible subarrays is O(n^2), which is way too slow. We need a smarter approach.

Let's think about the formula. The sum of a subarray can be handled using prefix sums. Let's denote the prefix sum array as s, where s[i] is the sum of the first i elements. Then the sum of a subarray from l to r is s[r] - s[l-1]. So the cost becomes (s[r] - s[l-1]) - k * ceil((r - l +1)/m). We need to maximize this value over all possible l <= r, including the empty case.

But the challenge is handling the ceil term. Let's express (r - l + 1) as the length of the subarray, which is the same as (r - (l-1)), so the length is len = r - (l-1). Wait, no. The length is r - l +1. Yes.

The ceil(len/m) can be rewritten as (len + m -1) // m. So for a given subarray length, we can compute how many times k is multiplied. So for each possible subarray, the cost is (sum) - k * ceil(len/m).

So the problem reduces to finding the maximum (sum of subarray) - (k * ceil(len/m)).

But how do we model this? Let's see. The sum of the subarray can be as high as possible, but we have to subtract a penalty term that depends on the length of the subarray.

Wait, the penalty is k multiplied by the ceiling of (len/m). So for len=1, it's 1/m ceiling which is 1. For len= m, 1. For len=m+1, 2, etc. So the penalty increases by k every m elements. So the penalty is roughly k * ceil(len/m) = k * floor((len + m -1)/m).

Hmm. So for a subarray of length len, the penalty is k multiplied by the number of "blocks" of size m. For example, m=3, len=4: ceil(4/3) = 2, so penalty is 2k.

So the problem is similar to the maximum subarray problem (like Kadane's algorithm) but with a varying penalty based on the length.

But how can we model this? Let's think for each possible possible position r, we need to find the best l such that (sum[r] - sum[l]) - k * ceil((r - l)/m) is maximized. Wait, the sum from l to r is sum[r] - sum[l], assuming l is the index before the subarray starts (like 0-based prefix sum). Then the length is (r - l) elements. So the penalty is ceil((r - l)/m) * k.

But how to handle this efficiently?

Let me try to rephrase the problem. For each r, we want to find the l (<= r) such that (sum[r] - sum[l]) - k * ceil( (r - l)/m ) is maximized, considering that the empty subarray is allowed (so l can be r, which gives a sum of zero, and length zero, penalty zero).

Wait, but the empty subarray's cost is zero, so we need to compare all possible subarrays' costs with zero and take the maximum.

So for each r, we need to compute the best l for all possible l's up to r. But this is O(n^2), which is not feasible. So we need a way to compute the best l for each r efficiently.

Let's model the problem as follows. For each position i, we can consider the maximum value of (sum[r] - sum[l]) - k * ceil( (r - l)/m ), for l ranging from 0 to r. Let's denote this as (sum[r] - sum[l]) - k * ceil( (r-l)/m ). We can rewrite this as sum[r] - [sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ) ].

So for each r, the maximum is sum[r] minus the minimum value of [ sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ) ] over all l from 0 to r. Then, the maximum for r is sum[r] minus the minimum of those terms. But then we also need to compare with zero (the empty subarray case).

Wait, but the empty subarray is when we take l = r, which gives (sum[r] - sum[r]) - k * ceil(0/m) = 0 - 0 = 0. So when we compute the maximum over all possible l (including l=r), then the case l=r is already considered. However, in the formula sum[r] - sum[l] for l=r would be zero, and the penalty would be ceil(0/m) = 0. So that's the empty subarray. So our approach for each r is to find the best l (possibly r) such that the cost is sum[r] - sum[l] - k * ceil( (r - l)/m ). Then, the maximum among all such r's and all l's (including l=r) would be the answer. Also, we can compare with zero in case all options are negative.

So for each r, the maximum possible contribution is sum[r] minus (sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m )) for l from 0 to r. So the maximum is sum[r] minus the minimum of (sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m )) for l <= r.

But how to compute this efficiently?

The key is to find for each r, the minimum possible (sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m )) over l <= r.

But the problem is that the term depends on (r - l) in a way that's not straightforward. Let's make a substitution. Let t = r - l. Since l ranges from 0 to r, t ranges from 0 to r (since l can be 0, t = r -0 = r, down to 0 when l=r). So for each r, the term sum[l] + k * ceil( t / m ), where t = r - l.

But sum[l] = sum[r - t] (since l = r - t).

So the term becomes sum[r - t] + k * ceil(t/m) for t in 0 to r.

So for each r, we need to find the minimum value of sum[r - t] + k * ceil(t/m) for t in 0...r.

But even with this substitution, for each r, checking all possible t up to r is O(n^2), which is not feasible.

So we need a way to track the minimal sum[r - t] + k * ceil(t/m) for each possible t mod m. Because the ceil(t/m) depends on how t is grouped into m-length blocks. For example, when t is in [0, m), ceil(t/m) is 1. When t is in [m, 2m), ceil is 2, etc.

Alternatively, ceil(t/m) can be written as (t + m -1) // m.

But how can we model this term in a way that allows us to track the minimal sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m )?

Let me consider that for a given t = r - l, ceil(t/m) = (t + m -1) // m. So for each possible remainder of t modulo m, we can group the values and track the minimal sum[l] + k * ( (t + m -1) // m ).

But perhaps we can model this for each possible remainder of (r - l) modulo m. Let's see. Suppose that for each possible remainder mod m, we track the minimal sum[l] + k * ( (r - l) + m -1 ) // m. But how?

Alternatively, for a given r, when we consider l = r - t, the term (r - l) is t. So the term is sum[r - t] + k * ceil(t/m). Let's think about how t can be expressed in terms of its division by m. Let t = q * m + rem, where 0 <= rem < m. Then ceil(t/m) = q + 1 if rem >0, else q (if rem is zero). Wait, no. For t = q*m + rem, where 0 <= rem < m. Then ceil(t/m) = q + (1 if rem >0 else 0). Wait, no. For example, m=3:

t=0 → 0/m → 0 → ceil is 0. But according to (t + m-1)/m → (0+2)/3=0.666, floor is 0. So ceil is 0. Hmm, but the original problem says that the empty subarray (t=0) has a penalty of 0, which makes sense. Wait, when t is the length of the subarray (r - l), but when l = r, t is zero. So the penalty is ceil(0/m) = 0.

Wait, in the problem statement, the cost is sum of the subarray (which is sum[r] - sum[l], but for l = r, the subarray is empty (since l starts at 0, and r is up to r). So when l = r, t = r - l = 0. Then the cost is 0 - k * 0 = 0.

But for other l's where t = r - l is the length of the subarray. So when you select a subarray of length len = t, the penalty is k * ceil(t/m).

So, the problem is to find for each r, the minimum value of sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ) for l in 0..r. Then subtract this from sum[r] and take the maximum over all r.

But how can we compute this efficiently?

Let me think about the term (r - l) as t. So t ranges from 0 to r.

But when we process each r, we can think of t as varying. For each possible remainder when (r - l) is divided by m, perhaps we can track some information.

Alternatively, for each possible remainder mod m, we can track the minimal sum[l] + k * ceil(t/m), where t is (r - l). But t = (r - l) → l = r - t.

So for a given r, when t is varying, but m is fixed, perhaps we can model this with m different states based on (r - l) mod m.

Wait, for example, suppose m=3. Let's look at possible remainders of (r - l) mod m. For each remainder, the ceil((r - l)/m) can be expressed in terms of the quotient and remainder.

Let me think: For any integer x >=0, x = a * m + b, where 0 <= b < m. Then ceil(x/m) is a+1 if x >0 (since x/m = a + b/m, which is at least a. So ceil is a+1 if x>0. Wait, no. For x=3 (m=3), 3/m=1 → ceil is 1. For x=4, 4/3 is 1.333 → ceil is 2. So in general, ceil(x/m) = (x + m -1) // m.

So for x = a*m + b, where b is in 0..m-1. Then x + m-1 = a*m + b + m -1 = (a+1)*m + (b-1). So (x + m -1) // m = a + (b + m -1) // m. Since 0 <= b <= m-1, (b + m-1) is in [m-1, 2m-2], so dividing by m gives 0 when b=0 (m-1/m → 0.999 → 0), and 1 when b >=1 (since m-1 +1 = m, so m-1 +1 is m, which is 1. So when x is a multiple of m (b=0), ceil(x/m) is a. Otherwise (b>0), it's a+1.

Wait, no. Let me take x=3, m=3 → a=1, b=0. x/m is 1, ceil is 1. For x=4 (m=3), a=1, b=1 → ceil is 2.

Wait, but for x=3, (x + m-1)/m = (3+2)/3 =5/3 → 1.666, floor is 1. So ceil is 2? Wait no, that's conflicting. Wait, the formula (x + m-1) // m gives the ceil of x/m. Let me check:

For x=3, m=3: (3+2)//3 =5//3=1 → which is ceil(3/3)=1. Correct.

x=4, (4+2)//3=6//3=2 → ceil(4/3)=2. Correct.

x=2, (2+2)/3=4//3=1 → ceil(2/3)=1. Correct.

x=0: (0 +2)/3=2//3=0 → ceil(0/3)=0. Correct.

So the formula works. So ceil(x/m) = (x + m-1) // m.

So, for a given x, this is how we can compute it.

Now, the term we are trying to compute for each l is sum[l] + k * ceil( (r-l)/m ). Let's denote d = r - l. So d can be any non-negative integer from 0 to r (since l can be as small as 0, leading to d=r).

The term becomes sum[r - d] + k * ((d + m-1) // m).

So for each r, we need to find the minimum of sum[r - d] + k * ((d + m-1) // m) for d in 0..r.

But how can we track this efficiently?

Let's think of d as varying, and for each possible remainder of d mod m, track the minimal sum[r -d] + k * ((d + m-1) // m).

Alternatively, since d = r - l, and l can be written as r -d.

But perhaps for each possible remainder mod m, we can track the minimal value of sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ), where (r - l) mod m is a certain value.

But since (r - l) mod m is equivalent to ( - (l - r) ) mod m. Let's see: Let's write (r - l) mod m = ( (r mod m) - (l mod m) ) mod m. So for each l, (r - l) mod m depends on l mod m.

But perhaps for each possible mod value of (r - l) mod m, which is ( (r mod m) - (l mod m) ) mod m, we can track the minimal sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ).

But I'm not sure. Let's try to think differently. Let's split the possible values of d (r - l) into groups where d mod m is a certain value. For each possible remainder r_d (0 ≤ r_d < m), the minimal sum[l] + k * ceil(d/m) for d = q*m + r_d. Since d = q*m + r_d, then ceil(d/m) is q + 1 (since r_d is non-negative, and if r_d is zero, then d is exactly q*m, so ceil is q. Wait, no. If d is q*m, then ceil(d/m) is exactly q. So if r_d is zero, then ceil(d/m) = q. For r_d >0, it's q+1.

So for each possible remainder r_d (from 0 to m-1), and for each possible q (the quotient when d is divided by m), we can model the term as sum[l] + k*(q + (1 if r_d > 0 else 0)).

But how does that help? Let's think for a given remainder r_d, which can be 0, 1, ..., m-1. For each r_d, the term sum[l] + k*(q + (1 if r_d >0 else 0)) can be rewritten as sum[l] + k*q + (k if r_d >0 else 0).

But d = q*m + r_d. Since d = r - l → l = r - (q*m + r_d). So for each possible r_d (remainder of d mod m), and q (quotient), l = r - q*m - r_d.

But since q can be any non-negative integer such that q*m + r_d ≤ r (since l ≥0), q can be up to (r - r_d) / m.

But this seems complicated. Let's think of another approach. For each possible remainder r_d (0 ≤ r_d < m), the minimal sum[l] + k*ceil(d/m) can be found by considering the minimal sum[l] + k*( (d + m -1) // m ), where d = r - l, which is equivalent to l = r -d.

But how can we model this for each possible r_d?

Wait, let's see. For a fixed r_d (the remainder when d is divided by m), d can be written as d = x*m + r_d. Then ceil(d/m) = x + (1 if r_d >0 else 0). So the term becomes sum[r -d] + k*(x + (1 if r_d>0 else 0)).

But d = x*m + r_d, so l = r - (x*m + r_d) = r - r_d - x*m. So for x varying such that l ≥0.

But this seems tricky. Perhaps the key insight is that for each possible remainder r_d, we can track the minimal sum[r -d] + k*ceil(d/m) for d ≡ r_d mod m. Since m is small (up to 10), perhaps we can precompute for each remainder, the minimal value.

So for each r, we can check all possible remainders of (r - l) mod m (from 0 to m-1), and for each such remainder, find the minimal sum[l] + k*ceil((r-l)/m).

But how to track this efficiently.

Alternatively, since m is small (up to 10), perhaps we can precompute for each possible mod value (the remainder when (r - l) is divided by m) the minimal sum[l] + k * ceil((r-l)/m).

Let's consider that for each possible remainder mod m, say, rem, we can track the minimal value of sum[l] + k * ceil( (r-l)/m ), where (r - l) ≡ rem mod m.

But (r - l) ≡ rem mod m → l ≡ (r - rem) mod m.

So for each possible rem (0 to m-1), we can track the minimal sum[l] where l ≡ (r - rem) mod m. And then add k * ceil( (r - l)/m ).

Wait, perhaps not. Let's see: For rem in 0..m-1, for each l such that (r - l) ≡ rem mod m, which is equivalent to l ≡ (r - rem) mod m. So for each such l, the value (r - l) can be written as q*m + rem. So ceil( (r - l)/m ) = q + (1 if rem >0 else 0). So the term sum[l] + k*(q + (rem>0)).

But q is (r - l - rem)/m. So sum[l] + k*( (r-l - rem)/m + (1 if rem>0 else 0) )

Which can be rewritten as sum[l] + k*( (r - l - rem + m*(rem>0 ? 1 :0 )) /m + ... )

Hmm, perhaps not the right direction. Let's think of it as for each possible rem (0..m-1), we need to find the minimal sum[l] + k * ( (r - l - rem)/m + (1 if rem>0 else 0) ), where (r - l) ≡ rem mod m.

But (r - l) = q * m + rem → q = (r - l - rem) / m. So (r - l - rem) must be divisible by m. So q is (r - l - rem)/m, which is an integer.

Thus, the term becomes sum[l] + k*( q + (1 if rem>0 else 0 )).

But q can be written as (r - l - rem)/m. So sum[l] + k*( (r - l - rem)/m + (1 if rem>0 else 0) )

But l = r - (q*m + rem). So substituting l into the term:

sum[ r - q*m - rem ] + k*( q + (1 if rem>0 else 0) )

But for a given rem, and varying q, how can we find the minimal value of this expression?

The problem is that q can vary, but for each rem, how to track the minimal sum[l] plus k multiplied by the corresponding term.

But since m is up to 10, perhaps we can precompute for each rem (0..m-1), the minimal value of sum[l] - (k/m)* (q*m + rem) + k*( (q + (1 if rem>0 else 0 )) )

Wait, perhaps not. Let's see:

sum[l] + k * ( q + (1 if rem>0 else 0) ) 

But q = (r - l - rem)/m → l = r - rem - q*m.

So substituting l into the sum gives sum[r - rem - q*m] + k * ( q + (1 if rem>0 else 0) )

But the variables here are q and rem. For each rem, we can track the minimal sum[r - rem - q*m] + k * ( q + (1 if rem>0 else 0) ), over all possible q such that l is >=0.

But how can this be done?

Alternatively, let's consider that for each possible rem (0..m-1), and for each possible q (number of blocks), we can track the minimal value of sum[r - rem - q*m] + k * ( q + (1 if rem>0 else 0) ). But q can vary from 0 upwards, as long as l = r - rem - q*m >=0.

But this seems like a lot to track for each rem. However, m is small (up to 10), so perhaps for each rem, we can track the minimal sum[l] - k * ( (r - l) - rem ) / m + ... ?

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows. For each possible remainder rem (0..m-1), we can track the minimal value of sum[l] + k * ( (r - l) + m - 1 ) // m. But the way to compute this efficiently is to find for each rem, the minimal sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ), where (r - l) mod m = rem.

So for each rem in 0..m-1, we can track the minimal sum[l] where l ≡ (r - rem) mod m, and for each such l, the term is sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ). Then, for the current r, we compute the minimal among all rem's of sum[l] + k*ceil(...) and subtract that from sum[r], then take the maximum.

But how to track these minimal values efficiently.

Let's try to find for each rem, the minimal sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ), where (r - l) ≡ rem mod m. Let's denote this as min_val[rem]. Then, for each r, the minimal value is the minimum of min_val[0], min_val[1], ..., min_val[m-1]. Then, the maximum cost for this r is sum[r] - min_val[rem] for some rem, and the overall maximum is the maximum over all r.

But how to compute min_val[rem] for each r.

Let's consider for each rem, what happens when we move to r+1.

Wait, perhaps when processing each r, we can compute the possible l's that correspond to each rem and update the min_val accordingly.

Alternatively, for each rem, the possible l's for r are those where l ≡ (r - rem) mod m. For example, when rem is 0, l must be congruent to r mod m, since (r - l) ≡ 0 mod m → l ≡ r mod m. So for rem=0, l can be r, r -m, r-2m, etc.

But for each rem, the possible l's are of the form r - rem - q*m. So l must be congruent to (r - rem) mod m. Because:

(r - l) ≡ rem mod m → l ≡ (r - rem) mod m.

So for each rem, the l's that are ≡ (r - rem) mod m.

But how can we track the minimal sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ) for each rem?

Let's think about for a given rem, when processing r, what is the minimal sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ) for l ≡ (r - rem) mod m.

But since (r - l) = q * m + rem. So q is (r - l - rem)/m. Since l >=0, q can be 0,1,... as long as l = r - rem - q*m >=0.

So for each rem, the term sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ) can be written as sum[l] + k * ( q + (1 if rem>0 else 0) ), where q = (r - l - rem)/m.

But l = r - rem - q * m → sum[l] is sum[r - rem - q*m].

So for each rem, and varying q, the term is sum[r - rem - q*m] + k*(q + (1 if rem>0 else 0)).

Now, for a given rem, when we process r, we can consider all possible q such that l >=0 (i.e., r - rem - q*m >=0 → q <= (r - rem)/m ). But how to track the minimal value of this expression as q varies.

But since q can be up to (r - rem)/m, which can be up to 3e5 / 1 = 3e5 for m=1, this is again O(n) per rem, leading to O(nm) time, which for m=10 is 3e6, manageable.

Wait, but this would be O(nm) time. Let's see. For each r, we loop through all m rem values. For each rem, we check all possible q (starting from q=0 up to q_max where l is non-negative). But q_max is (r - rem)/m. For m=10, r can be up to 3e5, so q_max can be up to 3e5 / 10 = 3e4. But if we loop through q for each rem and each r, this would be O(nm * q_max) = 3e5 * 10 * 3e4 = 9e10 operations, which is way too slow.

No, that's not feasible. So this approach isn't going to work.

Hmm. So we need a smarter way. Let's think differently. For each rem, can we model the minimal sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ) in a way that allows us to compute it incrementally?

Let's consider that for each rem, the possible l's are congruent to (r - rem) mod m. So for each rem, when processing r, the l's we can choose are those that are ≡ (r - rem) mod m.

But when processing r+1, the rem values for the next step will be different. So how to track this over time?

Alternatively, perhaps for each possible mod value of l (since m is small), we can track some information. For example, for each mod value of l (0..m-1), track the minimal sum[l] + k * ceil( (r' - l)/m ), for all r' up to current r.

But not sure.

Wait, maybe let's precompute for each possible remainder when l is divided by m. Since l can be up to 3e5, but m is up to 10, there are only 10 possible remainders.

Suppose we track for each remainder l_rem (0..m-1), the minimal value of sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ), where l ≡ l_rem mod m.

But how does this help?

For example, when processing r, to compute the minimal sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ), we can look at each possible l_rem (0..m-1), and find the minimal sum[l] for l ≡ l_rem mod m, plus k * ceil( (r - l)/m ).

But how to model the ceil term.

Alternatively, for a given l_rem, and current r, let's compute (r - l) = t. Since l ≡ l_rem mod m, then t = r - l → t ≡ (r - l_rem) mod m. So t mod m is (r mod m - l_rem mod m) mod m. So t can be written as t = q*m + rem_t, where rem_t = (r - l_rem) mod m. So the ceil(t/m) is q + (1 if rem_t >0 else 0). And q = floor(t/m).

But t = r - l. So for l ≡ l_rem mod m, t = r - l. So rem_t is (r - l) mod m = (r mod m - l_rem mod m) mod m. Which can be written as ( (r mod m) - l_rem ) mod m.

But for each l_rem (0..m-1), and current r, we can compute rem_t and then compute ceil(t/m).

But how to find the minimal sum[l] + k * ceil( (r - l)/m ) for l ≡ l_rem mod m.

But for l ≡ l_rem mod m, when r increases, the rem_t changes. So this seems difficult to model.

Alternative approach inspired by Kadane's algorithm:

Let's think of the problem as for each possible length of the current subarray modulo m, track the best possible sum and the penalty. For example, when building a subarray, the length can be grouped into categories based on mod m. When the length is congruent to 1 mod m, then adding another element would increase the penalty by 1 if the new length is now a multiple of m.

But I'm not sure. Let's think of it this way: suppose we track for each possible remainder mod m (current length mod m), the maximum value of (sum so far) - k * (number of penalties applied). Then, when adding a new element, we can update these values based on the previous remainders.

But how?

For example, let's say we are at position i, and considering adding a_i to the current subarray. If the previous remainder was r, then adding 1 to the length would make the new remainder (r + 1) mod m. The number of penalties applied depends on whether the new remainder is 0. Because when the remainder is 0, adding this new element completes a block of size m, and the penalty increases by 1. Otherwise, the penalty remains the same as before.

Wait, but the penalty is ceil(len/m), where len is the current length. So for a current length of len, the penalty is (len + m-1) // m. For each new element added (len increases by 1), the new penalty is (len + m) // m. Which can be (if (len +1) % m == 0) then new penalty is (len+1)/m. Otherwise, it's (len+1 + m-1) // m = (len + m) // m = ceil(len/m) + (1 if (len mod m) +1 > m else 0). Not sure.

Alternatively, the penalty increases by 1 when the length of the subarray reaches a multiple of m.

For example, len=1 → ceil(1/m). When m=3, len=1 → ceil(1/3)=1. len=2 → ceil(2/3)=1. len=3 → ceil(3/3)=1. len=4 → 2. So the penalty increases by 1 when len increases from 3 to 4. So every time the len increases by 1, the penalty increases by 1 if (len) is a multiple of m.

Wait, let's see: len+1 is a multiple of m → then ceil((len+1)/m) = (len+1)/m → the previous len was (len+1)-1 → (len) is (len+1 -1) = len → (len) = (m* (ceil(len/m)) -1). Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the penalty increases by 1 each time len increases by 1 and the new len is congruent to 1 mod m. Because, for example, when m=3:

len | penalty
0 → 0
1 → 1
2 → 1
3 →1
4 →2
5 →2
6 →2
7 →3
So penalty increases by 1 when len is 1,4,7,... → which is len ≡ 1 mod m.

Wait, yes. Because when len increases by 1, the new penalty is (len + m-1) // m. So the penalty increases by 1 when (len + m-1) >= (current penalty) * m.

Alternatively, when len increases from t to t+1, the penalty increases if (t+1 + m-1) // m > (t + m-1) // m. Which happens when t+1 is congruent to 1 mod m. Because (t + m) // m = t//m + 1 → so when t+1 is a multiple of m, then (t +1 + m-1) // m = (t + m) // m = (t//m) + 1. But the previous penalty was (t + m-1) // m = (t//m) if t mod m ==0, then (t +m-1)/m = t/m. So when t+1 is a multiple of m, the penalty increases by 1.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me take m=3 and t=2: t+1=3. (3 +3-1)/3 =5/3=1.666, floor is 1. But (3-1 +3-1)/3 is (2+2)/3=4/3=1.333, floor 1. So when t=3-1=2, adding 1 makes t+1=3, and (3 +3-1)/3 = (5)/3 → 1.666 → ceil is 2. So the penalty increases from 1 to 2. So the penalty increases when len is a multiple of m.

Wait, when len is a multiple of m, then (len + m-1)/m = (m*k + m-1)/m =k + (m-1)/m → ceil is k + 1. Wait no. Wait, if len is m*k, then (len + m-1)/m = (m*k + m-1)/m =k + (m-1)/m → ceil is k + 1-1/m? No. Wait, len = m*k → (m*k + m-1)/m = k + (m-1)/m → but since m-1 < m, the floor is k. But ceil(len/m) is exactly k. So this suggests that len is m*k → ceil is k. So when len increases from m*k-1 to m*k, the penalty increases by 1. Because:

For len = m*k -1: ceil( (m*k -1)/m ) = ceil(k - 1/m) = k.

For len = m*k: ceil( (m*k)/m ) = k.

Wait, no. So that's not right. Hmm.

Wait, for len= m*k-1:

ceil( (m*k -1)/m ) = ceil(k - 1/m) = k.

For len = m*k: ceil(k) = k. So no increase. So the penalty increases when len is 1 mod m?

Wait, let's take m=3:

len | penalty
0 → 0
1 →1
2 →1
3 →1 → (3+2)/3=5/3=1.666 → ceil is 2. Wait, no. Wait, len=3: (3+3-1)/3=5/3=1.666 → ceil is 2. So penalty is 2. So for len=3, penalty is 2. Hmm, so len=3 is m=3, so penalty is 1?

No, according to the problem statement, in the example:

In the first example, when m=3, a subarray of length 3 has ceil(3/3)=1. Oh right! The original problem uses ceil(len/m), not (len + m-1)/m. Wait, wait: ceil(len/m) is exactly (len +m-1) // m. So when len=3, m=3 → 3/3=1, ceil is 1. So len=3, the penalty is 1 * k.

So in that example, when len=3, the penalty is 1 * k.

But in the example given in the problem, the third subarray (len=3) has a penalty of 10*1=10, which matches.

So for len=3, the penalty is 1.

So my earlier mistake was in the example. So the penalty for len=3 is 1.

So what's the pattern here? For len=1: ceil(1/3)=1.

For len=2: ceil(2/3)=1.

For len=3: ceil(3/3)=1.

For len=4: ceil(4/3)=2.

So the penalty increases by 1 every m elements. So the penalty increases by 1 when the length increases from m*k to m*k+1.

So for each m, the penalty increases by 1 when the length is m*k + 1, m*k + 2, ..., m*k + m → after m elements.

So the penalty for a subarray of length len is floor( (len-1)/m ) + 1.

Because:

For len=1: (1-1)/3 = 0 → 0 +1=1.

For len=3: (3-1)/3=0.666 → floor is 0 → 0 +1=1.

For len=4: (4-1)/3=1 → floor 1 → 1+1=2.

Yes. So the penalty can be written as ((len-1) // m) + 1.

So this is equivalent to ceil(len/m).

So the penalty is k * ( (len-1) // m + 1 ).

So the cost is sum of subarray - k * ( (len-1) // m + 1 ).

Now, for the problem, we can model the cost as sum of the subarray minus k multiplied by this term.

Now, the key is to model this for all possible subarrays efficiently.

Let's think of this as tracking the best possible sum for each possible remainder of the current subarray's length mod m. For example, if the current subarray's length is congruent to r mod m, then when we add a new element, the length becomes (r+1) mod m. And we can track the maximum possible sum for each remainder.

Additionally, we need to track how many times the penalty has been applied, which depends on how many times the length has passed multiples of m.

But how to model this.

An alternative approach inspired by dynamic programming:

We can maintain for each possible remainder r (0..m-1) the best possible value when the current subarray's length is congruent to r mod m. For each r, we track two things: the maximum sum of the subarray minus k multiplied by the penalty, and the current penalty.

But the penalty depends on the total length of the subarray. For example, if the subarray's length is len = q*m + r (r ranges from 0 to m-1), then the penalty is q+1 (since (len-1) // m +1 = (q*m + r -1) // m +1. For r=0: (q*m -1) // m = q-1 → penalty q. For r >=1: (q*m + r-1) //m = q → penalty q+1.

So for a subarray of length len = q*m + r (0 <= r <m):

penalty = q + (1 if r >0 else 0) → no, wait:

For len = q*m + r (r ranges from 1 to m):

Wait, len can be written as (q-1)*m + (m) → but that's q*m. So perhaps the correct way is len = (q-1)*m + r, where r ranges from 1 to m.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's think again of the penalty as (len-1) // m +1.

For len = 1: (0) //3 +1 = 0+1=1.

For len=3: (3-1)//3 =2//3=0 → 0+1=1.

For len=4: (4-1)//3=1 → 1+1=2.

So the penalty is ((len-1) // m) +1.

So for a current subarray of length len, which is congruent to r mod m (r ranges from 0 to m-1), len can be written as q*m + (r+1) -1 → no. Wait, len-1 = q*m + (r), where r is between 0 and m-1. So (len-1) //m = q. So penalty is q +1.

So if the current length is len = q*m + r +1, where r is from 0 to m-1. So the remainder is (len-1) mod m = r. So for a current remainder of r, len-1 is congruent to r mod m. So len can be written as (len-1) = q*m + r → len = q*m + r +1. So the penalty is q+1.

Now, when we add a new element to the subarray, the length increases by 1. So the new len-1 is (len) → (len-1) +1 = len. So the new (len-1) is q*m + r +1. So the new remainder is (r +1) mod m. If the new remainder is 0, then (len-1) is congruent to 0 mod m, which means len-1 = (q+1)*m → len = (q+1)*m +1. So the penalty increases by 1.

Ah! So when the remainder changes from m-1 to 0, the penalty increases by 1. Because:

For example, m=3. Current remainder is 2 (r=2). Adding an element makes the new remainder (2+1) mod 3=0. So len-1 is (q*m + r) +1 = q*m +2 +1 = q*m +3 → (q+1)*m. So the penalty becomes (q+1) +1 = q+2, which is an increase of 1.

So the penalty increases by 1 when the remainder after adding an element is 0. 

So this suggests that we can model the dynamic programming states as follows:

For each remainder r (0..m-1), we track the best possible value (sum of the subarray minus k * penalty) and the current penalty. But how to track the penalty.

Alternatively, for each remainder r, we track the maximum value of (sum of the subarray) - k * (current penalty). The current penalty is q+1, where q is the number of times the remainder has cycled from m-1 to 0. 

But how can we model this?

Let's think that for each remainder r, when we add a new element, the remainder becomes (r+1) mod m. If the new remainder is 0, then the penalty increases by 1. Otherwise, the penalty remains the same.

So when we are at position i, processing a[i], for each possible remainder r (0..m-1), we can track the maximum possible value (sum_so_far) - k * penalty.

When adding a new element, the sum_so_far becomes previous sum plus a[i]. The remainder becomes (r+1) mod m. If the new remainder is 0, then the penalty increases by 1. So:

For each r in 0..m-1:

new_r = (r +1) % m

new_penalty = penalty + (1 if new_r ==0 else 0)

new_sum = current_sum + a[i]

new_value = new_sum - k * new_penalty

We can update the new_r state with the maximum between its current value and new_value.

But we also have the option to start a new subarray at position i. In that case, the remainder is 0 (since the subarray length is 1, len-1=0 → remainder 0), penalty is 0+1=1. The sum is a[i]. So the value is a[i] -k *1.

Additionally, the empty subarray is allowed, but we can handle that by considering the maximum between all computed values and zero.

So this approach seems promising. Let's formalize it.

We can maintain an array dp of size m, where dp[r] represents the maximum value (sum_so_far - k * penalty) for subarrays ending at the current position with a remainder of r.

When processing a new element a[i], we can compute a new_dp array based on the previous dp:

new_dp[new_r] = max( previous_dp[r] + a[i] - k * (1 if new_r ==0 else 0), a[i] -k *1 )

Wait, not exactly. Let's see:

For each r in 0..m-1:

- If we extend the previous subarray with remainder r, then the new remainder is (r+1) mod m. The penalty increases by 1 if new_r is 0.

So the penalty for the extended subarray is previous_penalty + (1 if new_r ==0 else 0). The sum is previous_sum + a[i].

The value for new_r would be (previous_sum + a[i]) - k*(previous_penalty + (new_r ==0 ? 1 :0 )).

But how is this related to the previous dp[r]?

The previous dp[r] is (previous_sum - k * previous_penalty).

So when extending, the new sum is previous_sum +a[i], new penalty is previous_penalty + (new_r ==0 ? 1 :0). So the new value is (previous_sum +a[i]) -k*(previous_penalty + delta) = (previous_sum -k*previous_penalty) + a[i] -k*delta = dp[r] + a[i] -k*delta.

Where delta is 1 if new_r is 0, else 0.

Additionally, we can start a new subarray at position i. This has length 1, remainder 0 (since len-1=0 → remainder 0), penalty is 1. The sum is a[i]. So the value is a[i] -k*1. So for new_r=0, the value could be max( previous_dp[0] extended, or a[i] -k*1).

So the transitions are:

For each new_r in 0..m-1:

new_dp[new_r] = max over all r where (r+1) mod m = new_r of (dp[r] + a[i] - k * delta) )

Additionally, for new_r=0, we can start a new subarray: a[i] -k*1. So we need to compare that with the value from extending.

So the recurrence is:

new_dp[new_r] = max( candidate_values )

where candidate_values include:

for each r such that (r+1) mod m == new_r:

dp[r] + a[i] - k * (1 if new_r ==0 else 0 )

and for new_r=0, also compare with a[i] - k*1.

Additionally, we can consider starting a new subarray for any new_r, but that's already handled by the initial transition.

Wait, no. Starting a new subarray for new_r=0 would correspond to a length of 1 (remainder 0), penalty 1. So the value is a[i] -k*1.

For other new_r, starting a new subarray would have len=1, but remainder (1-1) mod m =0 mod m, but len=1 → new_r=0. So this case is only possible for new_r=0.

So the transition for new_r=0 should take the maximum between extending existing subarrays and starting a new one.

But how to model this.

Let's formalize the steps for processing each element a[i]:

Initialize a new_dp array.

For each new_r in 0..m-1:

   new_dp[new_r] = max_candidate_value

   where max_candidate_value is the maximum between:

   (a) All previous dp[r] where (r+1) mod m == new_r. For each such r, compute the value as dp[r] + a[i] - (k if new_r ==0 else 0).

   (b) If new_r ==0, also consider the case where we start a new subarray here, which would be a[i] -k*1.

So for each new_r:

   candidates = []

   for all r in 0..m-1:

      if (r+1) mod m == new_r:

          candidates.append( dp[r] + a[i] - (k if new_r ==0 else 0) )

   if new_r ==0:

       candidates.append( a[i] -k )

   new_dp[new_r] = max(candidates) if candidates else -infinity

But wait, for new_r=0, the candidates include both the extensions and the new subarray.

But the new subarray has a value of a[i] -k*1.

Then, after processing all elements, the maximum possible value is the maximum of all dp[r] for all r, and zero (since empty subarray is allowed).

This approach is O(n*m) time, since for each element, we process m states, each requiring O(m) operations. But m is up to 10, so this would be O(n*10*10) = O(1e7) operations, which is manageable.

But wait, no. For each new_r, we need to loop through all m possible r's to check if (r+1) mod m == new_r. So for each new_r, this is O(m) operations, leading to O(m^2) per element. For m=10, this is 100 per element. For n=3e5, 3e5 * 100 = 3e7 operations, which is acceptable.

So this approach seems feasible.

Additionally, for the empty subarray, we need to compare the maximum with zero.

So the steps are:

Initialize dp as an array of -infinity, except for dp[0] (which represents the empty subarray? Wait, no. The initial state needs to be handled carefully.

Wait, initially, before processing any elements, the empty subarray has a cost of 0. But in our dp array, which represents subarrays ending at the current position (which is none), we need to initialize properly.

Wait, perhaps the initial state before processing any elements is that there are no subarrays. Then, for the first element, we can start a new subarray with a[0] -k*1 (if new_r=0) or start an empty subarray.

Alternatively, during the first iteration (processing the first element i=0), the possible new_r is 0 (since starting a new subarray of length 1 has new_r=0). So the initial dp array is all -infinity, except possibly new_r=0.

But let's proceed step by step.

Let's initialize dp as an array of -infinity for all m elements. For each element in the array:

Compute new_dp based on the previous dp and a[i].

For example, for the first element (i=0):

new_r can be 0 (since any previous state with r+1 mod m =0. But previous dp is all -infinity, so the only candidate is starting a new subarray, which is a[0] -k*1.

So new_dp[0] is max between (possible existing candidates from previous dp, which are none) and a[i] -k.

So new_dp[0] = a[0] -k.

For other new_r values, since there's no previous state that can transition to them, new_dp[new_r] remains -infinity.

Then, after processing the first element, the maximum value is max(new_dp[0], 0) → whichever is larger.

So the algorithm would proceed as follows:

Initialize dp as [-inf] * m.

max_result = 0

For each num in the array:

    new_dp = [-inf] * m

    for new_r in 0..m-1:

        candidates = []

        # Check all possible previous r's that transition to new_r

        for r_prev in 0..m-1:

            if (r_prev + 1) % m == new_r:

                # penalty increases if new_r is 0

                val = dp[r_prev] + num - (k if new_r ==0 else 0)

                candidates.append(val)

        # Also, if new_r is 0, consider starting a new subarray here

        if new_r ==0:

            candidates.append(num -k)

        # take the maximum of all candidates

        if candidates:

            new_dp[new_r] = max(candidates)

    # Update dp to new_dp

    dp = new_dp

    # compute current max value

    current_max = max(dp + [0])

    if current_max > max_result:

        max_result = current_max

At the end, return max_result.

This seems to model the transitions correctly.

Now, let's test this approach against the first example.

Sample Input 1:

7 3 10

2 -4 15 -3 4 8 3

Let's process each element step by step.

Initialize dp = [-inf, -inf, -inf]

max_result =0

Processing first element, 2:

new_dp is computed for each new_r.

For new_r=0:

candidates:

- r_prev must be 2 (since (2+1) mod3=0). But dp[2] is -inf, so no candidate from transitions.

- starting new subarray: 2 -10 = -8.

So new_dp[0] = -8.

Other new_r's (1 and 2) have no candidates.

So dp becomes [-8, -inf, -inf]

current_max is max(-8, -inf, -inf, 0) → 0. max_result remains 0.

Processing second element, -4:

new_dp is computed.

For new_r=0:

Check r_prev=2: (2+1) mod3=0. dp[2] is -inf. So no candidates from transitions.

Start new subarray: -4 -10 = -14.

So new_dp[0] = max(-14) →-14.

For new_r=1:

Check r_prev=0: (0+1) mod3=1. So candidate is dp[0] + (-4) -0 →-8 -4 =-12.

So new_dp[1] = -12.

For new_r=2:

Check r_prev=1: (1+1) mod3=2. But dp[1] is -inf. So no candidate.

So new_dp remains [-14, -12, -inf].

current_max is max(-14, -12, -inf, 0) →0.

max_result is still 0.

Processing third element, 15:

For new_r=0:

Check r_prev=2: (2+1) mod3=0. dp[2] is -inf.

Start new subarray:15-10=5.

So new_dp[0] =5.

For new_r=1:

Check r_prev=0: (0+1) mod3=1. Candidate is dp[0] (which is -14 from previous step) +15 -0 →1.

So new_dp[1] =1.

For new_r=2:

Check r_prev=1: (1+1) mod3=2. Candidate is dp[1] (-12) +15 -0 →3.

So new_dp[2] =3.

So new_dp is [5, 1, 3].

current_max is max(5,1,3,0) →5. max_result becomes 5.

Processing fourth element, -3:

For new_r=0:

Check r_prev=2: (2+1) mod3=0. dp[2]=3 → 3 + (-3) -10 (since new_r=0) →3-3-10 =-10.

Start new subarray: -3 -10 =-13.

So new_dp[0] is max(-10, -13) →-10.

For new_r=1:

Check r_prev=0: (0+1) mod3=1. Candidate is 5 + (-3) →5-3=2.

So new_dp[1] =2.

For new_r=2:

Check r_prev=1: (1+1) mod3=2. Candidate is 1 + (-3) →-2.

So new_dp[2] =-2.

So new_dp is [-10, 2, -2].

current_max is 2, but max_result is 5.

Processing fifth element,4:

For new_r=0:

Check r_prev=2: (2+1) mod3=0. dp[2] is-2 →-2 +4 -10 =-8.

Start new subarray:4-10= -6.

So new_dp[0] = max(-8, -6) →-6.

For new_r=1:

Check r_prev=0: (0+1) mod3=1. Candidate is -10 +4 →-6.

So new_dp[1] =-6.

For new_r=2:

Check r_prev=1: (1+1) mod3=2. Candidate is 2 +4 →6.

So new_dp[2] =6.

current_max is 6, max_result is 6.

Processing sixth element,8:

For new_r=0:

Check r_prev=2: (2+1) mod3=0. dp[2] is6 →6+8-10=4.

Start new subarray:8-10= -2.

So new_dp[0] = max(4, -2) →4.

For new_r=1:

Check r_prev=0: (0+1) mod3=1. Candidate is -6 +8=2.

So new_dp[1] =2.

For new_r=2:

Check r_prev=1: (1+1) mod3=2. Candidate is new_dp[1] (current is -6? Wait, no. dp is [ -6, -6,6] from the previous step.

Wait, after fifth element processing, dp is new_dp = [-6, -6, 6].

So for sixth element 8:

For new_r=0:

r_prev must be 2. dp[2] =6. So 6 +8 -10 =4. Also start new subarray:8-10=-2. So new_dp[0] =4.

For new_r=1:

r_prev=0: dp[0] =-6 +8 →2.

So new_dp[1] =2.

For new_r=2:

r_prev=1: dp[1] =-6 +8 →2.

So new_dp[2] =2.

current_max is 4 (from new_dp[0]). Max_result is now 6.

Processing seventh element,3:

For new_r=0:

r_prev=2: dp[2]=2. 2+3 -10= -5. New subarray:3-10= -7. So new_dp[0] is max(-5, -7) →-5.

For new_r=1:

r_prev=0: dp[0]=4. 4+3 →7. So new_dp[1] =7.

For new_r=2:

r_prev=1: dp[1]=2 →2+3=5.

So new_dp is [-5,7,5].

current_max is7. Which is the sample output of 7.

Yes! So this approach works for the first example.

The second sample input:

5 2 1000

-13 -4 -9 -20 -11

Processing each element:

All elements are negative, so the best subarray is the empty one (0).

So the algorithm's max_result would stay 0.

Yes.

So the approach works.

Now, the code:

We need to read n, m, k.

Then the array.

Initialize dp as [-inf] * m.

max_result =0.

For each num in a:

    new_dp = [-inf] * m.

    for new_r in range(m):

        candidates = []

        # find all r_prev such that (r_prev +1) mod m == new_r.

        for r_prev in range(m):

            if (r_prev +1) % m == new_r:

                val = dp[r_prev] + num

                if new_r ==0:

                    val -=k

                candidates.append(val)

        if new_r ==0:

            candidates.append(num -k)

        if candidates:

            new_dp[new_r] = max(candidates)

    dp = new_dp

    current_max = max(max(dp),0)

    if current_max > max_result:

        max_result = current_max

return max_result.

But we need to handle the case where m=1. Let's see:

For m=1, the penalty is ceil(len/1) = len. So the cost is sum of subarray -k * len. The maximum subarray is the maximum (sum -k*len), which is equivalent to the maximum subarray sum when each element is (a_i -k). Because sum -k*len = sum (a_i) -k* len = sum (a_i -k) for the elements in the subarray. So the maximum is the maximum subarray sum of the modified array a_i -k, or zero.

But with the dynamic programming approach, for m=1:

The remainder after adding each element increases by 1 mod 1 → which is 0. So new_r is always 0.

So for each new element:

new_r=0.

So for new_r=0, the transitions are from r_prev=(0+1 mod 1) →0 → r_prev=0.

So candidates from extending are dp[0] + num -k (since new_r=0, subtract k).

And also starting new subarray: num -k.

So new_dp[0] = max(dp[0] + num -k, num -k).

Which is the same as Kadane's algorithm for the maximum subarray sum of (a_i -k). And the maximum is between the best of that and zero.

So the code handles this case correctly.

Therefore, this approach should work for all cases.

Now, the Python code:

We need to read the input, process each element, and update the dp array.

Implementing this in Python with m up to 10.

The code will be:

Read n, m, k.

Read the array a.

Initialize dp as [-infinity] * m.

max_result = 0.

For each num in a:

    new_dp = [-inf] * m

    for new_r in range(m):

        candidates = []

        for r_prev in range(m):

            if (r_prev + 1) % m == new_r:

                val = dp[r_prev] + num

                if new_r ==0:

                    val -=k

                candidates.append(val)

        if new_r ==0:

            candidates.append(num - k)

        if candidates:

            new_dp[new_r] = max(candidates)

    dp = new_dp

    current_max = max(max(dp), 0)

    if current_max > max_result:

        max_result = current_max

print(max_result)

But wait, when m=1, new_r is always 0. So for each step, new_dp[0] is max(dp[0] + num -k, num -k).

Which is exactly the standard Kadane's algorithm for the modified array a[i]-k.

Yes.

Testing the code with the first sample:

Sample input 1:

7 3 10

2 -4 15 -3 4 8 3

The code would process each element as before, and the final max_result is 7.

Sample input 2:

5 2 1000

-13 -4 -9 -20 -11

Each element, when processed, will have a new_dp where all candidates are negative. So current_max remains zero, which is the output.

So the code works.

Regarding the data types, since a_i can be up to 1e9 and n is 3e5, the sum can be up to 3e14, which fits in Python's integers.

The code uses O(m) space, which is acceptable.

The time complexity is O(n * m^2), which for m=10 is 1e6 * 100 = 3e7 operations, manageable within the time limit.

So the code should be correct.
