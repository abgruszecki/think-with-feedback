<think>
Okay, let's try to solve this problem. Hmm. So the problem is about two participants who each have a pair of numbers. Their pairs share exactly one common number, which is the one they want to figure out. They communicate sets of possible pairs to each other, and we need to determine if we can know the common number for sure, or if both know but we don't, or if it's ambiguous.

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. Let me rephrase. The participants have a pair each. Their pairs have exactly one common number. The first participant tells the second a set of possible pairs (including their actual pair), and vice versa. Based on these communicated sets, we have to determine certain cases.

The output options are: the number if we can know it, 0 if both know but we can't, and -1 otherwise.

So the key steps are:

1. Find all possible candidate pairs (a, b) from the first participant's set and (c, d) from the second's, such that the intersection between a and b and c and d is exactly one number.

These candidate pairs (the possible real pairs) are the ones that could be the actual pairs given to the participants. For each such candidate, the common number is part of the possible answers.

But how do we process this?

Let's think. The first thing is to find all possible pairs (p1, p2) where p1 is in the first set and p2 is in the second set, and p1 and p2 share exactly one number.

Each such pair (p1, p2) contributes a possible common number. Then, we need to see what the set of possible common numbers is.

If all possibilities result in the same common number, then we can output that. If there are multiple possible numbers but in all cases, both participants can know the number, then we output 0. Otherwise, output -1.

Wait, but how do we determine if both participants know the number with certainty?

So, for each possible (p1, p2) pair that is a valid candidate (they share exactly one number), we need to check two things:

- For the first participant, given that their actual pair is p1, and the second's communicated set is m pairs (the second line input), would they be able to determine the common number?

Wait no. Wait, the participants are communicating their sets to each other. So each participant knows their own possible pairs and the other's possible pairs. Then, given their own actual pair, they can deduce possible pairs from the other's set that share exactly one number with their own.

So for example, the first participant has a pair p1. They know that the second's pair must be one of the pairs in the second's communicated set (the third line of input) that shares exactly one number with p1. Then, based on that, the first participant can compute possible common numbers and see if there's only one possibility.

Similarly for the second participant.

So, for each candidate (p1, p2) in the valid possibilities, we need to check two conditions:

1. For the first participant, when their own pair is p1, they look at all possible pairs in the second's set (the m pairs) that share exactly one number with p1. Then, the possible common numbers are those overlapping numbers. If all those possible pairs from the second's set lead to the same common number, then the first participant can know it.

2. Similarly for the second participant, when their pair is p2, they look at all possible pairs in the first's set (n pairs) that share exactly one number with p2. If all those lead to the same common number, then the second can know it.

Only in cases where both participants can determine the common number for their respective possible pairs (p1, p2), then this candidate contributes to the 0 case. Because if in all possible candidates (p1, p2) that are possible, both participants know the common number, then regardless of which candidate is the real one, they both know the number. But if the possible candidates lead to different numbers, then we (the observer) can't know which it is, hence output 0.

So the steps are:

1. Find all possible valid pairs (p1, p2) where p1 is in the first set, p2 is in the second set, and p1 and p2 share exactly one number.

2. For each such (p1, p2), compute the common number (the intersection of p1 and p2).

3. For each (p1, p2), determine whether both participants can determine the common number with certainty.

   a. For participant 1 (with p1), collect all possible pairs in the second set (m's set) that share exactly one number with p1. For each such pair p2_candidate, the common number is the intersection between p1 and p2_candidate. If all those common numbers are the same, then participant 1 can know the number.

   b. Similarly for participant 2 (with p2), collect all pairs in the first set (n's set) that share exactly one number with p2. If all their common numbers are the same, then participant 2 can know.

   c. So for a candidate (p1, p2) to contribute to the 0 case, both participants must be able to determine the number (i.e., for p1, all possible p2_candidate in second set that share exactly one number with p1 have the same common number; and similarly for p2 and the first set).

4. Now, the possible common numbers are the ones from the valid (p1, p2) pairs.

If all of them have the same common number, then output that number.

Otherwise, check if all valid (p1, p2) pairs have the property that both participants can determine the number (even if their numbers are different). If all pairs in the possible valid set satisfy that both can determine, then output 0.

Otherwise, output -1.

Wait, no. The 0 case is when all possible valid (p1, p2) pairs result in both participants being able to determine the number, but the possible numbers (from those pairs) are different, so we can't know. So in this case, the output is 0.

Otherwise, if there's a possible (p1, p2) where at least one participant cannot determine the number, then the output is -1.

So the steps are:

- Collect all valid (p1, p2) pairs (sharing exactly one number).

- For each of these, compute:

   a. The common number x (the intersection between p1 and p2).

   b. Check if in participant 1's case, with p1, all possible p2_candidate in the second set that share exactly one number with p1 have the same common number. So for participant 1, the possible pairs are all p2_candidate in the second set where |p1 ∩ p2_candidate| = 1. Then, collect all those common numbers. If they all are the same, then participant 1 can know x.

   c. Similarly for participant 2 with p2.

- Then, for each valid (p1, p2), we have x (the common number), and two flags: k1 (participant 1 can know x) and k2 (participant 2 can know x).

Now, we need to collect all possible x's from the valid (p1, p2) pairs. Let's call this possible_x.

Case 1: All possible_x are the same. Then, output that x.

Case 2: possible_x has multiple values, but for all (p1, p2) in the valid pairs, both k1 and k2 are true. Then, output 0.

Case 3: Else, output -1.

So the algorithm would be:

1. Generate all possible (p1, p2) pairs where p1 is in the first set, p2 is in the second set, and |p1 ∩ p2| == 1.

   For each such pair:

   a. Compute x (the common element).

   b. For participant 1 (using p1), check if all possible p2_candidate in the second set that share exactly one element with p1 have the same x as the common element. If so, then k1 is True.

   c. Similarly, for participant 2 (using p2), check if all p1_candidate in the first set that share exactly one element with p2 have the same x. If so, k2 is True.

   d. Record (x, k1, k2) for this (p1, p2).

2. Collect all x from all valid (p1, p2) pairs.

   - If all x are the same, output x.

   - Else, check if for all (p1, p2) in the valid pairs, both k1 and k2 are True. If yes, output 0.

   - Else, output -1.

Now, the key is how to efficiently compute k1 and k2 for each (p1, p2).

Let's think about how to compute k1 for a given p1.

Participant 1 has p1. They look at the second's communicated set (m's set). For all p2_candidate in m's set where the intersection between p1 and p2_candidate is exactly 1 element. For each such p2_candidate, collect the common element. Then, check if all those elements are the same. If yes, then k1 is True.

Similarly for k2.

So for each p1 in the first set, when checking for k1, we can precompute a set of possible p2_candidate in the second set that share exactly one element with p1. Then collect all their common elements. If the size of the set of common elements is 1, then k1 is True.

But wait, for each (p1, p2) pair in the valid set, when checking k1, it's not just the p2 in the pair, but all possible p2_candidate in the second set that form a valid pair with p1. Because when participant 1 has p1, they don't know which p2_candidate is the actual one. They only know that the actual p2_candidate must share exactly one element with their own p1.

So for a given p1, the possible p2_candidate is all in the second set where their pair with p1 has exactly one common element. The participant 1 must, based on that, determine the x. So if all possible p2_candidate in that group have the same x, then they can know x.

So for the pair (p1, p2) in the valid set, to compute k1, we need to look at all p2_candidate in the second set that form a valid pair with p1 (i.e., share exactly one element with p1). Then, collect all x's from those pairs. If all are the same, then k1 is True.

So the steps for k1 for a given (p1, p2):

Compute all p2_candidate in second_set where |p1 ∩ p2_candidate| == 1. For each such p2_candidate, the x is the common element. Collect all x's. If the set of x's has size 1, then k1 is True.

Similarly for k2.

So for each (p1, p2) in the valid pairs:

k1 depends on p1 and the second's set.

k2 depends on p2 and the first's set.

Now, how to implement this efficiently.

First, read the inputs. The first set is n pairs. The second set is m pairs. Each pair is stored as a set or a sorted tuple (so that order doesn't matter, since (a, b) is the same as (b, a)).

But since the problem states that within each set, all pairs are distinct and no pair is reversed. So, for example, if (1,2) is present, (2,1) is not. So we can represent each pair as a sorted tuple.

So for processing, each pair can be stored as a sorted tuple (a, b), so that checking intersections is easier.

So first, read the input pairs:

For the first participant's pairs:

Read the second line as a list of integers, then group into pairs, sorted. So for example, input line "1 2 3 4" becomes [(1,2), (3,4)].

Similarly for the third line, pairs of the second participant.

Now, for each possible (p1, p2) pair from first and second's sets:

Check if the intersection of their elements is exactly one. For p1 and p2, which are tuples (a, b) and (c, d), the intersection is the set {a, b} ∩ {c, d}. If the size is 1, then proceed.

So the first step is to generate all valid (p1, p2) pairs.

Once we have all these valid pairs, we process each of them.

For each such pair, compute x, which is the common element.

Then compute k1 and k2 for this pair.

How to compute k1:

For p1, look through all p2_candidate in the second's set. For each p2_candidate, check if |p1 ∩ p2_candidate| == 1. For those that do, collect the common element. Then, check if all these elements are the same.

Similarly for k2.

So for each (p1, p2) pair, the k1 and k2 are determined as follows.

Wait, but (p1, p2) is part of the valid pairs. But for k1, the participant 1's possible p2_candidate includes all possible pairs in the second set that share exactly one element with p1, including the p2 in the current pair.

So even if the current (p1, p2) is valid, the participant 1's possible p2_candidate could be others, which may have different x.

So for example, if the second's set has two p2_candidate that are valid with p1, each with different x, then k1 is False for any (p1, p2) in that group.

So for each (p1, p2) pair in the valid pairs, the k1 depends on all p2_candidate in the second's set that are valid with p1.

So, for each (p1, p2), to compute k1, it's not enough to look at p2. We have to consider all possible p2_candidate in the second set that form a valid pair with p1.

Therefore, for each (p1, p2), to compute k1, we need to:

1. For the first participant's p1, collect all p2_candidate in the second set where {a, b} ∩ {c, d} has size 1.

2. For each of these, compute the intersection element.

3. Check if all those elements are the same.

Similarly for k2.

This can be time-consuming, but given that n and m are up to 12, the total possible pairs are 12*12=144, which is manageable.

So, steps for code:

Read n and m.

Read the second line: first set. Split into pairs, sorted. So for example, read 2n numbers, group into n pairs, each sorted.

Same for the third line: second set.

Now, generate all possible valid (p1, p2) pairs between the two sets.

For each p1 in first_set:

   for each p2 in second_set:

      s_p1 = set(p1)

      s_p2 = set(p2)

      intersection = s_p1 & s_p2

      if len(intersection) == 1:

          add (p1, p2) to the valid_pairs list, along with x (the element in intersection).

Now, for each valid_pair in valid_pairs, we need to compute k1 and k2.

Let's process k1 for a given p1.

For p1:

collect all p2_candidate in second_set where the intersection with p1 is exactly 1.

For each such p2_candidate, compute x_candidate (the intersection element).

Collect all x_candidate into a set. If the size of this set is 1, then k1 is True.

Similarly for k2 for p2.

So for each (p1, p2, x) in valid_pairs:

compute k1 for p1:

   s_p1 = set(p1)

   x_list = []

   for p2_candidate in second_set:

       s_c = set(p2_candidate)

       if len(s_p1 & s_c) == 1:

           x_c = (s_p1 & s_c).pop()

           x_list.append(x_c)

   if all elements in x_list are same:

       k1 = True

   else:

       k1 = False

Similarly for k2:

   s_p2 = set(p2)

   x_list = []

   for p1_candidate in first_set:

       s_c = set(p1_candidate)

       if len(s_p2 & s_c) == 1:

           x_c = (s_p2 & s_c).pop()

           x_list.append(x_c)

   if all elements same:

       k2 = True

   else:

       k2 = False

Once we have for each (p1, p2, x) the values of k1 and k2, then:

Collect all possible x's from the valid_pairs.

Case 1: all x's are the same.

   output x.

Else:

   check if all (k1 and k2) for all valid pairs.

   if yes: output 0.

   else: output -1.

But wait, how about if some valid pairs have (k1 and k2) true, and others not? Then, the output is -1.

So, the code steps are:

Collect all possible x's from the valid_pairs.

If all x's are same:

   Output x.

Else:

   Check if for every valid_pair in valid_pairs, both k1 and k2 are True.

   If yes:

       Output 0.

   Else:

       Output -1.

So the code structure is:

Read inputs.

Generate valid_pairs as list of tuples (p1, p2, x).

Collect x_candidates = {x for (p1, p2, x) in valid_pairs}.

If len(x_candidates) == 1:

   print(x_candidates.pop())

Else:

   check if for all valid_pair in valid_pairs, k1 and k2 are True.

   How to compute this:

   For each (p1, p2, x) in valid_pairs:

       compute k1 and k2.

   Then, for all of them, check if (k1 and k2) is True.

   If all are True:

       print(0)

   else:

       print(-1)

So now, the code can be structured as follows.

But first, how to represent the pairs.

Read the first line as n and m.

Read the second line as list of integers, split into pairs.

Read the third line as list of integers, split into pairs.

For example:

In the first sample input:

2 2

1 2 3 4

1 5 3 4

The first set is [(1,2), (3,4)].

The second set is [(1,5), (3,4)].

Now, generate valid_pairs:

For p1 in first set:

p1 is (1,2):

Check with each p2 in second set.

p2 (1,5):

intersection {1} → valid. x is 1.

p2 (3,4):

intersection {3,4} with p1 (1,2) → len is 0. invalid.

So (1,2) pairs with (1,5), x=1.

p1 (3,4):

Check with p2 (1,5): intersection is empty. invalid.

p2 (3,4): intersection is {3,4} → len 2. invalid.

So no valid pairs here.

So valid_pairs has only one entry: ( (1,2), (1,5), 1 )

Now, for this (p1, p2):

Compute k1 for p1 (1,2):

look at all p2_candidate in second set ( [(1,5), (3,4)] )

for each, check if intersection with (1,2) is 1.

(1,5) → yes, x=1.

(3,4) → intersection is empty. invalid.

So x_list is [1]. All same → k1 is True.

k2 for p2 (1,5):

look at all p1_candidate in first set ( [(1,2), (3,4)] )

Check if intersection with (1,5) is 1.

p1_candidate (1,2): intersection {1} → x=1.

p1_candidate (3,4): intersection empty → invalid.

So x_list is [1]. All same → k2 is True.

So in this case, k1 and k2 are both True. The x is 1, and since all x are 1, output 1.

Which matches the first sample.

Another sample where output is 0:

Sample input 2:

2 2

1 2 3 4

1 5 6 4

The first set is [(1,2), (3,4)].

Second set is [(1,5), (6,4)].

Valid pairs:

For p1 (1,2):

Check with p2 (1,5): intersection {1} → valid. x=1.

Check with p2 (6,4): intersection empty → invalid.

So valid pair is ( (1,2), (1,5), 1 )

For p1 (3,4):

Check with p2 (1,5): intersection empty → invalid.

Check with p2 (6,4): intersection {4} → valid. x=4.

So another valid pair is ( (3,4), (6,4), 4 )

So valid_pairs has two entries with x=1 and x=4.

So x_candidates is {1,4}, so len>1.

Now, check for each of the two valid pairs whether both k1 and k2 are True.

First valid pair ( (1,2), (1,5) ):

k1 for p1 (1,2):

Check all p2_candidate in second set that intersect (1,2) with exactly 1.

In second set, (1,5) is valid (x=1), (6,4) is invalid.

x_list is [1] → k1 is True.

k2 for p2 (1,5):

Check all p1_candidate in first set that intersect (1,5) with exactly 1.

In first set, (1,2) is valid (x=1), (3,4) is invalid (no intersection).

x_list is [1] → k2 is True.

So for this pair, both k1 and k2 are True.

Second valid pair ( (3,4), (6,4) ):

k1 for p1 (3,4):

Check all p2_candidate in second set that intersect (3,4) with exactly 1.

Second set:

(1,5): intersection with (3,4) is empty → invalid.

(6,4): intersection {4} → valid. x=4.

So x_list is [4]. → k1 is True.

k2 for p2 (6,4):

Check all p1_candidate in first set that intersect (6,4) with exactly 1.

First set:

(1,2) → intersection with {6,4} is empty → invalid.

(3,4) → intersection {4} → x=4.

So x_list is [4] → k2 is True.

So for both valid pairs, k1 and k2 are True. So all valid pairs have k1 and k2 True. So output is 0.

Third sample input:

2 3

1 2 4 5

1 2 1 3 2 3

First set: [(1,2), (4,5)].

Second set: [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)].

Valid pairs:

Check each pair:

For p1 (1,2):

Check with each p2 in second set:

p2 (1,2): intersection {1,2} → len 2. invalid.

p2 (1,3): intersection {1} → len 1. x=1.

p2 (2,3): intersection {2} → len 1. x=2.

So two valid pairs here: ( (1,2), (1,3), 1 ) and ( (1,2), (2,3), 2 ).

For p1 (4,5):

Check each p2 in second set. All p2 have elements 1,2,3. So no intersection with {4,5}. So no valid pairs.

So valid_pairs are the two pairs from p1 (1,2).

Now, collect x_candidates: {1, 2}.

Check for each valid pair whether both k1 and k2 are True.

First pair: (1,2), (1,3), x=1.

Compute k1 for p1 (1,2):

Check all p2_candidate in second set that have intersection size 1 with (1,2).

These are (1,3) and (2,3). Their x's are 1 and 2. So x_list is [1,2]. So not all same. So k1 is False.

So for this pair, k1 is False.

k2 for p2 (1,3):

Check all p1_candidate in first set that intersect (1,3) with exactly one element.

First set is [(1,2), (4,5)].

(1,2) intersects {1,3} → {1} → valid. x=1.

(4,5) → no intersection. invalid.

So x_list is [1] → k2 is True.

So for this pair, k1 is False, k2 is True. So (k1 and k2) is False.

Second pair: (1,2), (2,3), x=2.

k1 for p1 (1,2) is same as previous. x_list is [1,2] → k1 False.

k2 for p2 (2,3):

Check all p1_candidate in first set that intersect (2,3) with exactly one element.

First set's p1_candidate (1,2) → intersection {2} → valid. x=2.

(4,5) → no intersection. invalid.

So x_list is [2] → k2 is True.

So k1 is False, k2 is True. (k1 and k2) is False.

So for all valid_pairs, (k1 and k2) is False. So the condition where all pairs have k1 and k2 True is not met. So output is -1.

Which matches the third sample.

So the code works.

Now, implement this in Python.

But how to represent the pairs and process them.

Implement steps:

Read n and m.

Read the second line as list of integers. Split into n pairs, each as a sorted tuple.

Same for third line.

Generate valid_pairs: list of tuples (p1, p2, x), where p1 is in first_set, p2 in second_set, and their intersection has size 1. x is the common element.

Then, for each (p1, p2, x) in valid_pairs:

Compute k1 and k2.

Now, the code.

First, handling the input.

In Python:

n, m = map(int, input().split())

first_line = list(map(int, input().split()))
first_pairs = []
for i in range(n):
    a = first_line[2*i]
    b = first_line[2*i +1]
    first_pairs.append( (min(a,b), max(a,b)) )

second_line = list(map(int, input().split()))
second_pairs = []
for i in range(m):
    a = second_line[2*i]
    b = second_line[2*i +1]
    second_pairs.append( (min(a,b), max(a,b)) )

Then generate valid_pairs.

valid_pairs = []

for p1 in first_pairs:
    s_p1 = set(p1)
    for p2 in second_pairs:
        s_p2 = set(p2)
        intersect = s_p1 & s_p2
        if len(intersect) == 1:
            x = intersect.pop()
            valid_pairs.append( (p1, p2, x) )

Now, collect x_candidates.

x_candidates = {x for (_, _, x) in valid_pairs}

if len(x_candidates) == 1:
    print(x_candidates.pop())
else:
    # Check if all valid pairs have k1 and k2 True.

    all_true = True

    for (p1, p2, x) in valid_pairs:
        # Compute k1 for p1.

        # k1: all p2_candidate in second_pairs that share exactly one with p1 must have same x.

        s_p1 = set(p1)
        x_list = []
        for p2_candidate in second_pairs:
            s_c = set(p2_candidate)
            if len(s_p1 & s_c) == 1:
                x_c = (s_p1 & s_c).pop()
                x_list.append(x_c)
        # Check if all x_c are same.
        k1 = (len(set(x_list)) <= 1)

        # Compute k2 for p2.
        s_p2 = set(p2)
        x_list2 = []
        for p1_candidate in first_pairs:
            s_c = set(p1_candidate)
            if len(s_p2 & s_c) == 1:
                x_c = (s_p2 & s_c).pop()
                x_list2.append(x_c)
        k2 = (len(set(x_list2)) <= 1)

        if not (k1 and k2):
            all_true = False
            break  # No need to check further.

    if all_true:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(-1)

But this code may have some inefficiencies. For example, for each valid pair (p1, p2), when checking k1, it recomputes for p1 all possible p2_candidate in the second set, even if this p1 was checked before. So for multiple valid pairs with the same p1, the same computation for k1 is done multiple times. But since n and m are small (up to 12), this is acceptable.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, m = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    first_line = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))

Sample3:

valid_pairs has two entries. For each:

First entry:

k1 for p1 (1,2) checks all p2_candidate in second set that share exactly one. They are (1,3) and (2,3). x_list becomes [1, 2]. So set size 2 → k1 is False. So k1 and k2 (True) → False. all_true becomes False. Loop breaks.

Output -1.

Thus, the code works for the samples.

Now, code should handle all cases.

Potential optimizations: precompute for each p1 in first_pairs the possible x_list for k1, and cache it, since for multiple pairs with the same p1, the x_list is the same. Similarly for p2.

But given the constraints (n and m up to 12, and valid_pairs up to 12*12=144), it's acceptable.

Thus, the code is correct.
