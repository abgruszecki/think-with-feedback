Okay, let's see. The problem is to convert a given number of centimeters (n) into feet and inches, with the feet being as maximum as possible. Then, the remaining inches part needs to be rounded to the closest integer, but according to the specific rounding rules mentioned. Hmm.

Wait, the note says when rounding up, 1 cm rounds up to 0 inches and 2 cm rounds up to 1. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the rounding. Let me think again. Oh right, because in Baden, an inch is 3 cm. So each inch is 3 cm. So the conversion from cm to inches isn't the usual division. Let's see.

Wait, the problem says that the result should be an integer (the inches part) rounded to the closest value containing an integral number of inches. But how exactly?

Wait, the actual way to compute inches from centimeters is: since 1 inch is 3 cm, the number of inches is the cm divided by 3, but with a specific rounding rule. The note clarifies the rounding. For example, 1 cm would round to 0 inches (since it's closer to 0 than to 1 inch (3 cm)), and 2 cm would round to 1 inch (since 2 is closer to 3 than to 0? Or maybe the problem's note is a bit different. Let me re-read the note.

Note says: when you round up, 1 cm rounds up to 0 inches and 2 cm rounds up to 1 inch. Wait, maybe that's not the standard rounding. Wait, perhaps the problem is using a specific rounding method where the cutoff is between 1.5 cm. So, for example, anything less than 1.5 cm rounds down (to 0 inches), and 1.5 or more rounds up (to 1 inch). But how does that apply here?

Wait, the problem statement says the result should be rounded to the closest value. So for example, if you have n cm, you first convert to inches by dividing by 3, but then round to the nearest integer. But perhaps the note gives examples of how this rounding works for 1 and 2 cm. Let me see:

For 1 cm: 1 /3 = 0.333... inches. The closest integer is 0, so rounded to 0. That's correct.

For 2 cm: 2/3 = 0.666... inches. Closest integer is 1. So the output is 1 inch. So the note examples are correct.

So the standard rounding to the nearest integer is applied here. So for the inches part, it's (n_cm) divided by 3, and rounded to the nearest integer. Then, once you have the total inches (after rounding), you convert that to feet and inches (with feet being as maximum as possible). Wait, but the problem says that the feet should be maximum possible. So the total inches (after rounding) is split into feet (each 12 inches) and the remaining inches. So, for example, if the total inches is 14, then 1 foot (12 inches) and 2 inches left.

So the steps are:

1. Convert n cm to inches, rounded to the nearest integer. Let's call this total_inches.

2. Then, compute how many feet and inches that is: feet = total_inches // 12, inches = total_inches % 12.

But wait, the problem says "so that the number of feet was maximum". So yes, when you have total inches, you can't have more feet than total_inches allows. So the split is straightforward.

So the main challenge is correctly calculating the total_inches by rounding the cm to the nearest inch (each inch is 3 cm).

So how do we compute the rounded inches? Let's take n cm. Since each inch is 3 cm, the number of inches is n / 3. We need to round this to the nearest integer.

In Python, the standard way to round is using the round() function, which rounds to the nearest integer, with 0.5 cases rounded to the nearest even integer. But let's check if that's correct according to the problem's examples.

Looking at the first example:

Input is 42 cm. 42 /3 is 14 inches. So no rounding needed. So total_inches is 14. Then, feet is 14//12=1, inches is 2. So output is 1 2. Which matches the example.

Second example: input is 5 cm. 5/3 is approximately 1.666..., which rounds to 2 inches. So total_inches is 2. Then, 0 feet and 2 inches. So output is 0 2. Which matches the example.

Another test case: let's say n=3. 3/3=1.0, rounded to 1. So 0 1. If n=4, 4/3=1.333, which rounds to 1. So 0 1. If n=5, 5/3 is 1.666, rounds to 2. So 0 2. If n=2, 2/3=0.666, rounds to 1. So 0 1.

Wait, but according to the note, 2 cm rounds up to 1 inch. Which aligns with this. So using the standard round function in Python would handle this correctly.

Wait, for n=1 cm: 1/3 is 0.333, which rounds to 0. For n=2 cm: 0.666 rounds to 1. For n=3: 1.0 rounds to 1. For n=4: 1.333 rounds to 1. For n=5: 1.666 rounds to 2. For n=6: 2.0 rounds to 2.

So using the standard round function here should be correct. Let's see:

In Python, round(0.333) is 0, round(0.666) is 1, round(1.333) is 1, round(1.666) is 2. So yes, that's correct.

So the approach is:

Calculate total_inches = round(n / 3)

But wait, wait: in Python, when you divide integers, you get a float. So for example, n=5, 5/3 is 1.666..., which when rounded is 2. So total_inches is 2.

Then, compute feet and inches:

feet = total_inches // 12

inches = total_inches % 12

So the code would be:

n = int(input())

total_inches = round(n / 3)

a = total_inches // 12

b = total_inches % 12

print(a, b)

Wait, but wait: what if n is not divisible by 3, but when divided by 3, the decimal part is exactly 0.5? For example, n= 1.5 cm? But the input n is given as an integer. So n is an integer between 1 and 10000. So n is in cm. For example, n=3: exactly 1 inch. n=4 cm: 4/3 is 1.333..., which rounds to 1. So 1 inch. But when n is 4, that's 1.333... which rounds to 1. So 4 cm converts to 1 inch, which is 3 cm. So that's 1 cm less than the original. But according to the problem's rounding rules, that's correct.

So the code seems straightforward. Let's test some edge cases.

Edge case 1: n=0. But according to constraints, n is at least 1. So not possible.

Edge case: n=1. 0.333 rounds to 0. So total_inches 0. Then 0 0. But wait, 1 cm. The note says 1 cm rounds to 0. So output is 0 0. Wait, but the problem statement says to print two non-negative integers. So yes.

Another example: n=2. Rounds to 1. So 0 1.

Another example: n=3. Rounds to 1. So 0 1.

n=4: 4/3=1.333 rounds to 1. 0 1.

n=5: 5/3=1.666 rounds to 2. 0 2.

n=6: 2.0, rounds to 2. 0 2.

n=12 cm: 4 inches. 0 4.

n=36 cm: 12 inches. 1 0.

n=37 cm: 37/3 = 12.333..., rounds to 12. So 1 foot (12//12=1, 0). So output 1 0.

Wait, no: 37 cm is 12.333... inches. Rounding that would be 12, so total_inches is 12. 12 inches is 1 foot, 0 inches. So output 1 0.

Another example: n=38 cm. 38/3=12.666..., which rounds to 13. 13 inches is 1 foot and 1 inch. So output 1 1.

So the code works for these cases.

So the code seems to handle all cases correctly.

Now, what about when the total_inches is something like 14.5? Wait, but in our case, total_inches is an integer, because after rounding. So the code would be correct.

Now, the code for the problem is straightforward. Read n, compute total_inches as round(n/3), then split into feet and inches.

But wait, in Python, when you divide an integer by 3 using /, you get a float. So for example, 5/3 is 1.666..., which when rounded is 2.

But in Python, the round function works as expected for .5 cases, rounding to the nearest even integer. For example, round(2.5) is 2, round(3.5) is 4. But in the problem statement's note, what about when the cm is exactly 1.5 cm (but since n is an integer, that's impossible). So for example, when n=3 cm, exactly 1 inch. For even cases where the fractional part is exactly 0.5, like n= (3k + 1.5) cm. But since n is integer, this can't happen. Because 3k + 1.5 would require n to be a non-integer, which is not possible. So all possible n are integers, so n/3 can be of the form x.0, x.333..., or x.666... So the round function will correctly round these to the nearest integer.

So the code should work.

So the code would be:

n = int(input())
total_inches = round(n / 3)
print(total_inches // 12, total_inches % 12)

That's all. Let's check the examples.

First example: 42 cm.

42 /3 is 14.0. Rounded to 14. 14 //12 is 1, 14%12 is 2. Output 1 2. Correct.

Second example: 5 cm.

5/3 is 1.666... rounds to 2. 0 and 2. Correct.

Another test case: n=2. Output is 0 1. Correct.

n=1: 0.333 rounds to 0. Output 0 0.

n=4: 1.333 rounds to 1. 0 1.

n=6: 2.0 rounds to 2. 0 2.

n=35: 35/3 is 11.666... rounds to 12. 1 0.

Yes.

So this code should handle all cases correctly. And it's O(1), so even for the maximum input of 10000, it's fine.
