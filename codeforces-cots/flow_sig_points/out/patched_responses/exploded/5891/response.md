Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum number of operations to delete the entire string. Each operation allows us to delete a contiguous substring where all characters are the same. So, for example, if there's a block of same characters, we can delete it in one step. But if they are interleaved with others, we need to find a way to delete them optimally.

Hmm, so the key is to model this as a dynamic programming problem. Because the optimal way to delete a substring might depend on how we delete parts of it first. Let's think about breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems.

Let's consider a DP approach where dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations needed to delete the substring from index i to j (inclusive). We want to compute dp[0][n-1], which is the answer for the entire string.

The base case is when i > j, which would take 0 operations. For a single character, i == j, it's 1 operation.

For the recursive case, when we have a substring from i to j:

1. If the character at i is the same as the character at j, then maybe we can merge the operations. For example, if the substring starts and ends with the same character, perhaps deleting some middle part first, then deleting the combined blocks. But how exactly?

Wait, here's an idea. Suppose s[i] == s[j]. Then, maybe we can look at the subproblem from i to j-1 or i+1 to j and see if we can combine. Or maybe even if there's a k in between where s[i] == s[k], then splitting into i..k and k+1..j and then combining if possible.

Alternatively, perhaps we can look at the case where we first delete the middle part, then the remaining parts can be merged. Like, if we delete i+1 to j-1 first, then the remaining i and j (if same) can be deleted in one operation. But this depends on how the deletions are structured.

Another approach is inspired by the problem of merging palindromic substrings. For example, in some DP solutions for palindromes, you check the ends and proceed accordingly.

So, here's a possible recurrence:

For dp[i][j], the minimum of:

- dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] - 1 if s[k] == s[k+1], but maybe that's not directly applicable.

Wait, let's think. If the substring from i to j starts and ends with the same character, perhaps we can delete the entire block in one step after deleting the middle parts. For example, if the entire string is surrounded by 'a's, then deleting the middle part first would leave the 'a's on both ends, which can be merged into a single contiguous block and then deleted in one operation.

Alternatively, when s[i] == s[j], then maybe the optimal way is to first delete the inner part (i+1 to j-1), which would leave the two ends as the same character, allowing us to delete them in one operation. So the total would be dp[i+1][j-1], but only if the inner part is handled optimally.

But that's not necessarily always the case. For example, maybe there are other positions where the same character appears, leading to better options.

Alternatively, the recurrence could be:

dp[i][j] = min(
    dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] for all k in i..j-1
)

But this is O(n^3) time, which for n=500 would be 500^3 = 125 million operations, which might be manageable within 3 seconds. But perhaps we can optimize this.

But the key is to find cases where combining the ends can lead to a better (smaller) number of operations.

Wait, here's another thought. If the characters at positions i and j are the same, then maybe the optimal way is to delete the middle part first, then the outer characters can be deleted in one step. For example, consider "abaca". Let's say i=0 and j=4 (the entire string). The first character is 'a' and the last is 'a'. So, perhaps we can delete the substring from 1 to 3 (which is "bac") in some steps, and then delete the two 'a's in one step. So the total would be dp[1][3] + 1. But wait, how? Because after deleting the middle part, the two 'a's are adjacent, so they can be deleted in one operation. But the initial steps are to delete the middle part. So the total would be the steps to delete the middle part plus 1.

But how do we model that?

Alternatively, the recurrence could be:

If s[i] == s[j], then dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] if the middle part is completely deleted, and then the outer two are merged. But maybe that's not always the case. For example, in "abba", deleting the middle 'bb' first (1 step) leaves the two 'a's, which can be deleted in another step, total 2. But perhaps there's a better way. Wait, no. The original "abba" can be deleted in two steps: first delete the 'bb' (1 step), then delete the 'aa' (another step), total 2. But according to the DP approach, the initial step would be to compute dp[0][3] = dp[1][2] (since s[0] == s[3] is 'a' == 'a'). dp[1][2] is the substring 'bb', which takes 1 step. Then adding 0? Because after deleting the middle part (bb), the two a's are adjacent and can be deleted in 1 step. So the total would be 1 (for the middle) + 1 (for the ends) = 2, which is correct. So the recurrence would be dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] when s[i] == s[j]?

Wait, no. Because in that case, for dp[i][j], if s[i] == s[j], then the optimal way might be to first delete the middle part (i+1 to j-1) and then the two ends can be merged. So the steps would be steps for the middle part plus 1. But in the example above, the middle part is 'bb', which takes 1 step, then the ends 'aa' take another step. So the total is 2 steps, which is 1 (for the middle) + 1 (for the ends) = 2. But according to the idea that if s[i] == s[j], then dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1], which would be 1. But that's wrong. So the recurrence isn't that.

Hmm. So maybe the recurrence when s[i] == s[j] is that we can have a case where dp[i][j] = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i+1][j-1] + (s[i] != s[j] ? 1 : 0)) ... but that's not clear.

Alternatively, let's think of the standard way for similar DP problems, like the problem of painting the blocks, or merging stones. Another similar problem is the optimal strategy to remove all balls with certain conditions.

Wait, another approach: let's precompute the positions where the same characters are grouped. For example, if the string is a sequence of runs of the same character, then the minimum number of steps is just the number of runs. But when there are overlapping runs that can be merged, perhaps the answer can be optimized. But the problem allows deleting any contiguous substring of same characters, which can merge adjacent same characters once they are contiguous.

So for example, the string 'abcddcba' from the sample input: the minimal steps are 4. Let's see:

The string is a b c d d c b a. So, perhaps:

1. Delete the two 'd's (step 1).

2. Now the string is a b c c b a. Then delete the two 'c's (step 2).

3. Now the string is a b b a. Delete the two 'b's (step 3).

4. Then delete the 'a's (step 4).

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to delete parts in a different order to get the same result.

But how does that relate to the DP approach?

Another idea: when considering a substring from i to j, if s[i] is the same as s[j], then perhaps we can combine the deletion steps. For instance, in the example where i and j are the same character, maybe we can split the problem into i to k and k+1 to j-1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the recurrence can be:

If s[i] == s[j], then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i+1][j-1] + 1).

Wait, that's not correct. For example, in "aaaa", dp[0][3] would be 1, which is correct. For the case where i and j are same, but the characters in between are different. Like "abaca" in the first sample. The entire string starts and ends with 'a', but the middle is 'bac'. So the minimal steps are 3. Let's see:

The sample input is 'abaca'. The optimal steps are:

1. Delete 'b' (step 1).

2. Delete 'c' (step 2).

3. Delete the three 'a's (step 3). Total 3 steps.

But how does the DP approach compute this.

Alternatively, the steps could be:

1. Delete the first 'a' (step 1).

2. Delete 'bac' as three steps (but that's not allowed; each step must delete a contiguous block of same characters. So 'bac' is three separate steps. So that's 1+3=4 steps, which is worse than the optimal.

So the minimal steps are 3. How does the DP approach model this.

Let's model the DP for the first sample. Let's see:

The string is a b a c a.

For dp[i][j], when i=0 and j=4 (the entire string):

s[0] is a, s[4] is a. So the recurrence would consider merging. For example, maybe dp[0][4] = dp[1][3] + 0? Because after deleting the middle part (b a c), we have the a's at the ends. But the a's would be adjacent once the middle is deleted. Wait, no. The original string is a (0), then b (1), a (2), c (3), a (4). When the middle part from 1 to 3 is deleted (characters b, a, c), the remaining characters are a (0) and a (4). But those are not contiguous. So deleting them would require two separate steps. So the total steps would be steps to delete 1-3 (which is 'ba c' â€” but how? Let's see.

The substring from 1 to 3 is 'bac'. To delete this substring:

First, delete 'b' (1 step), then 'a' (another step), then 'c' (third step). So three steps. Then the remaining 'a's at 0 and 4 are two separate characters. So deleting them would take two steps. So total steps would be 3 + 2 = 5, which is worse than the sample's answer of 3. So the initial approach of assuming that if the ends are the same, then we can combine the steps isn't correct.

Wait, but the sample's answer is 3. How is that possible? Because the steps are:

Delete 'b' (step 1), delete 'c' (step 2), then delete all three 'a's (step 3). So after step 1 and 2, the string becomes 'a a a', which is contiguous, so can be deleted in one step. So total 3 steps.

Ah, right! Because after deleting 'b' and 'c', the a's become contiguous.

So the order of deletion matters. So the DP approach needs to model the possibility of merging different parts when the same characters are adjacent after some deletions.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think again about the DP recurrence.

The standard approach for such interval DP problems is to consider the following:

For each interval i to j, the minimal steps can be found by considering all possible splits into i to k and k+1 to j, then take the minimum of dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j]. However, if s[k] == s[k+1], maybe there's a way to merge the steps. Wait, but in this problem, the operations can delete any contiguous substring of same characters. So perhaps if s[i] is the same as s[k], then deleting i to k and k+1 to j could be done in one step if those are contiguous and same characters. But only if they are merged.

Alternatively, the key is that when two adjacent intervals have the same character at their ends, then the steps can be merged. For example, if the left part ends with 'a' and the right part starts with 'a', then after deleting the left part (steps) and the right part (steps), the 'a's might become contiguous and could have been deleted in one step. But how to model this.

Alternatively, this is similar to the problem of merging stones, where the cost can be reduced if adjacent groups have certain properties.

In our case, the optimal solution for the interval i..j can be found by:

1. If we delete a substring at the end first, then proceed.

Alternatively, for the interval i..j, if s[i] is the same as some character in the middle, perhaps we can delete a substring starting at i and ending at k, then proceed with k+1 to j. But how?

Alternatively, here's a possible recurrence:

dp[i][j] = min(
    dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] - (1 if s[k] == s[k+1] else 0) for all k in i..j-1
)

But why subtract 1 if the split points have the same character? Because if the split is between k and k+1 where s[k] == s[k+1], then after deleting the left part and the right part, the two separate operations for the left and right parts may have included those characters. But maybe the two parts can be merged into one operation. However, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, when we split into i..k and k+1..j, the total steps are dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j], but if the character at k and k+1 are the same, perhaps the two parts can be merged in some way. But I'm not certain how.

Alternatively, think about the case where the entire interval i..j can be split into two parts where the last character of the left part and the first character of the right part are the same. Then, after deleting the left and right parts, those two same characters might be adjacent, which allows us to delete them in one step. So the total steps would be dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] - 1.

But how to model this in the recurrence.

This is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps let's look for some standard DP solutions for similar problems.

After some research (in my mind), this problem is similar to the problem of optimally removing all characters with certain constraints, and the solution often involves interval DP with transitions that consider merging when the ends are the same.

For example, the problem where you can remove a pair of identical adjacent characters and the solution uses DP where dp[i][j] is the minimal steps to remove the interval. In such cases, the recurrence considers if the ends are the same and if merging is possible.

In our case, the allowed operation is to delete a contiguous substring of same characters. So, perhaps the steps can be optimized by first deleting certain parts to merge same characters, thereby reducing the number of steps needed.

So here's a possible recurrence for dp[i][j]:

If i > j: dp[i][j] = 0.

If i == j: dp[i][j] = 1.

Else:

If s[i] == s[j], then dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + (1 if the first and last characters are the same but the inner part's steps don't already account for merging them). Or perhaps not. Alternatively, when s[i] == s[j], we can consider the case where we first delete the substring from i+1 to j-1, then delete the remaining two characters (i and j) along with any adjacent same characters. But wait, after deleting the inner part, the characters at i and j become adjacent. So if they are the same, they can be deleted in one operation. So the total steps would be the steps to delete the inner part plus 1 (for deleting the merged i and j).

But that's not always the case. For example, if the inner part takes dp[i+1][j-1] steps, and after deleting it, the i and j positions are same, so they form a contiguous block. So then the total steps would be dp[i+1][j-1] (steps to delete inner part) + 1 (step to delete the merged i and j). So dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 1? No, because deleting the inner part leaves the i and j characters as adjacent, which can be deleted in one step. Wait, no. Let's think: if the inner part is deleted first, then the i-th character and j-th character become adjacent. So if they are the same, they form a contiguous block and can be deleted in one step. So the total steps would be (steps to delete inner) + 1.

But that's only if the inner part is completely deleted. So for example, in the case of "abaca", the inner part from 1 to 3 is "bac". Deleting that requires 3 steps (each character is separate). Then the two 'a's at 0 and 4 become adjacent. So deleting them takes 1 step. So total 3+1=4 steps, but the sample answer is 3. Wait, so that approach doesn't work. Hmm. So the sample's optimal solution is better than this approach. So there's a better way.

Ah, right! Because in the sample, after deleting the 'b' and 'c' (steps 1 and 2), the 'a's in positions 0, 2, and 4 become contiguous. So the steps are:

Delete 'b' (step 1), delete 'c' (step 2), then delete the three 'a's (step 3). So total 3 steps.

So how does this fit into the DP approach?

Perhaps the DP needs to consider the case where merging can happen even if the inner parts are not all deleted. For example, in the 'abaca' case, the optimal way is to delete the 'b' and 'c' first, which allows the 'a's to merge. So the DP for the entire string (0-4) would be the sum of the steps to delete 'b' (1) and 'c' (1) plus 1 for the 'aaa' block. So 3 steps.

But how to model this.

Alternatively, the DP approach for dp[i][j] can consider the following:

If s[i] == s[k], where k is some position in i..j, then we can split the problem into i..k and k+1..j. But if s[i] == s[k], then perhaps deleting i..k and then k+1..j can allow the remaining parts (after deletion) to have contiguous characters that can be merged. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, here's the correct recurrence:

dp[i][j] = min(
    dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] - (1 if s[i] == s[k+1] else 0)
    for all k in i..j-1
)

But why subtract 1? Because if the two parts (i..k and k+1..j) have the same starting character, then deleting the first part may leave behind characters that can be merged with the next part's deletions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the standard recurrence is:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] for all k in i..j-1)

But also, if s[i] == s[j], then we can consider dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1] + 1).

Wait, perhaps:

The initial approach is to split into any possible k and take the sum of the two parts. Then, check if the ends are the same, and see if merging can lead to a better solution.

So, for example:

dp[i][j] = min(
    dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] for all k in i..j-1
)

Additionally, if s[i] == s[j], then:

dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1] + 1)

But why +1? Because after deleting the inner part (i+1 to j-1), the two ends are same, so we can delete them in one step. So the total is steps for the inner part (dp[i+1][j-1]) plus 1 step for the merged ends.

But in the sample case, this would give:

For the entire string 0-4 (a b a c a), the s[i] and s[j] are both 'a'. So we can consider dp[0][4] = dp[1][3] + 1. The inner part is 'b a c', which requires 3 steps (each character is separate). So dp[0][4] would be 3+1=4, but the sample answer is 3. So this approach isn't correct.

Hmm, so the problem with this approach is that the inner part's steps may not account for the possibility of merging when the same characters are in the middle. So perhaps the recurrence needs to be more nuanced.

Let's think of the problem in terms of combining adjacent runs. For example, if there are multiple same characters separated by others, but by deleting certain parts first, they can be merged into a single block, which can then be deleted in one step.

The key is to find the best way to merge these blocks through deletion order.

This suggests that the DP[i][j] should be the minimal steps required to delete the substring, and for each possible split, we can check if merging the left and right parts would reduce the total steps.

Alternatively, here's a correct approach from similar problems:

We can model the problem with DP[i][j] as the minimum steps to delete the substring i..j.

The recurrence is:

dp[i][j] = min(
    dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] for all k in i..j-1
)

But also, if s[i] == s[j], then dp[i][j] can be min(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j] (delete i first), dp[i][j-1] (delete j first), dp[i+1][j-1] + 1 (delete inner part and then the two ends in one step)).

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again.

Wait, in the sample input 'abaca', the minimal steps are 3. Let's see how the DP would compute this.

The string is a(0) b(1) a(2) c(3) a(4).

The minimal steps for 0-4 is 3.

Let's compute DP for all possible intervals.

The base cases are all intervals of length 1: dp[i][i] = 1.

Now for intervals of length 2:

For 0-1 (ab): the minimal steps are 2 (delete a, then b).

For 1-2 (ba): steps are 2.

For 2-3 (ac): steps are 2.

For 3-4 (ca): steps are 2.

For intervals of length 3:

Let's take 0-2 (aba):

s[0] = a, s[2] = a.

So, possible options:

Split into 0-0 (a) and 1-2 (ba): steps 1 + 2 = 3.

Split into 0-1 (ab) and 2-2 (a): steps 2 + 1 =3.

Also, since s[0] == s[2], check if 0-2 can be dp[1][1] (steps 1) + 1 = 2. Because after deleting the middle 'b' (step 1), the a's at 0 and 2 become adjacent, and can be deleted in one step. So total steps 1+1=2.

So dp[0][2] would be 2.

Similarly, for interval 1-3 (bac):

s[1] is 'b', s[3] is 'c', so no merging. The minimal steps would be split into any k, leading to 1+1+1 = 3 steps.

So DP[1][3] is 3.

Now, for interval 0-4 (abaca):

The possible splits are:

k=0: dp[0][0] + dp[1][4] (1 + ... )

dp[1][4] is the substring 'baca'. Let's compute that.

For 'baca' (indices 1-4):

s[1] = 'b', s[4] = 'a' â†’ different. So split into k=1: dp[1][1] (1) + dp[2][4] (a c a). Let's compute dp[2][4].

s[2] = a, s[4] = a.

Possible splits for 2-4:

k=2: dp[2][2] (1) + dp[3][4] (2 steps) â†’ total 3.

k=3: dp[2][3] (2 steps) + dp[4][4] (1) â†’ 3.

Also, since s[2] == s[4], check if dp[3][3] (steps 1) + 1 â†’ 2. So dp[2][4] = 2.

So dp[1][4] would be 1 (dp[1][1]) + 2 (dp[2][4}) â†’ 3.

So split at k=0: 1 +3=4.

Other splits:

k=1: dp[0][1] (2) + dp[2][4] (2) â†’ 4.

k=2: dp[0][2] (2) + dp[3][4] (2) â†’ 4.

k=3: dp[0][3] (assuming that's a certain value) + dp[4][4} (1). Let's compute dp[0][3} (abac).

For 0-3 (a b a c):

s[0] = a, s[3] = c â†’ different.

So the minimal steps would be splitting into any possible k.

For example, split into 0-2 (aba) steps 2, and 3-3 (c) steps 1. Total 3.

So dp[0][3} = 3.

So split at k=3: 3 +1=4.

Now, the case where s[0] == s[4} (a and a). So check the option where we compute dp[1][3} (3 steps) and add 1. So dp[0][4} = 3 +1 =4.

But the sample answer is 3, so this approach isn't working. What's wrong here?

Ah! Because there's another way to split the intervals. Let's see.

Maybe in the case of the entire interval 0-4, the optimal split is not in k=2, but in some other k where s[k] == s[0} or s[j}.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a k where s[k] == s[0}, which allows merging.

For example, in the interval 0-4, the third character is 'a' (index 2). So s[0} = 'a' == s[2}.

So, perhaps splitting the interval into 0-2 and 3-4.

The dp[0][2} is 2 (steps), and dp[3][4} is 2 (steps). But the total is 2+2=4. But how can this lead to the sample's answer of 3?

Ah, but perhaps the order of deletion allows merging. For example, deleting 3-4 (ca) first would take 2 steps (c and a). Then deleting 0-2 (aab) which becomes a contiguous block. Wait, no. Original string is a b a c a. If we delete 'c a' first (indices 3-4), that's two steps: delete 'c', then delete 'a'. Then the remaining string is a b a. Which is 'ab a'. Deleting 'b' (step 3), then deleting 'aa' (step 4). Total steps 4. But that's worse than the sample's answer.

So perhaps the correct way is to model the DP[i][j} as follows: for each possible split, and also consider merging when some characters in the middle are the same as the ends.

Wait, here's a different approach. Let's preprocess the string into runs. For example, the string 'abaca' has runs: a (1), b (1), a (1), c (1), a (1). So the number of runs is 5. The minimal steps can't be less than the number of runs divided by something. But in this case, the sample's answer is 3, which is less than 5. So that approach isn't helpful.

Another idea: the minimal steps required to delete a string is equal to the number of runs if we can't merge any runs. For example, each run requires a separate step. But if we can merge runs through deletion order, then the steps can be reduced.

But how to model this.

Let's consider the example where the string is a b a. The runs are a (1), b (1), a (1). The minimal steps is 2: delete 'b' first, then delete the merged 'a's. So steps: 2, which is less than the number of runs (3). So the number of runs is not a direct factor here.

So the DP approach must consider overlapping intervals where same characters can be merged by deleting the intervening characters first.

Let's think of the recurrence again. Perhaps the correct recurrence is:

dp[i][j] = min over k from i to j-1 of (dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] - (1 if s[k] == s[k+1] else 0)).

This is because if the split at k and k+1 has the same character, then the two separate deletions of the left and right parts would have required steps to delete their respective ends, but after deletion, the characters at the split would be merged, allowing one less step.

But how does this work for the sample input.

In the sample 'abaca', for the entire interval 0-4:

We can split at k=2 (the middle 'a'). So the left part is 0-2 (a b a) and the right part is 3-4 (c a).

The left part (0-2) has dp value 2. The right part (3-4) has dp value 2. Since s[2] is 'a' and s[3] is 'c', which are different. So the total steps would be 2+2=4. But if we split somewhere else, like k=1:

Left part is 0-1 (ab), steps 2. Right part is 2-4 (a c a), steps 2. So total 4.

But the sample's answer is 3. So this approach is not capturing that.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct recurrence needs to also account for cases where a middle character is the same as the ends, allowing for a merge when the middle is deleted.

Wait, for the entire interval 0-4, the first character is 'a' and the last is 'a'. The middle character at index 2 is also 'a'. So perhaps deleting the middle parts (like deleting 'b' and 'c') first, which allows all three 'a's to merge into a single block, which can be deleted in one step. So the steps are:

Delete 'b' (step 1), delete 'c' (step 2), delete 'aaa' (step 3). Total 3 steps.

So how to model this in the DP.

The key is that when there's a character in the middle that is the same as the ends, deleting certain parts can merge multiple runs into one, reducing the number of steps.

So, perhaps the recurrence is:

dp[i][j] = min(
    dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] - (1 if s[i] == s[k+1] else 0),
    for all k in i..j-1
)

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, here's another approach inspired by a solution to a similar problem:

The minimal steps for interval i..j is 1 if all characters in i..j are the same. Otherwise, it's min over all k in i..j-1 of dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j], and if s[i] == s[j], then also consider dp[i+1][j-1] + 1.

Wait, no. Because even if s[i] == s[j], the minimal steps might not be achieved by that.

Alternatively, when s[i] == s[j], the minimal steps can be min of the split-based steps and dp[i+1][j] (assuming delete s[i] first and then the rest), and also dp[i][j-1] (delete s[j] first and then the rest), and dp[i+1][j-1] + 1 (delete the middle part and then the ends).

But this doesn't seem to directly apply.

Another idea: the DP recurrence can be written as follows:

For each interval i..j:

If s[i] == s[j], then dp[i][j] = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i+1][j-1] + 1).

Otherwise, dp[i][j] is the min of splitting into two parts.

But this approach doesn't consider all possibilities. For example, the sample input's optimal solution requires considering that deleting two separate characters in the middle allows the 'a's to merge.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct recurrence is:

dp[i][j] = min(
    dp[i+1][j] + 1,  # delete s[i] first, then the rest
    dp[i][j-1] + 1,  # delete s[j] first, then the rest
    min( dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] for all k in i..j-1 )
)

But this seems to ignore cases where merging can happen.

Alternatively, here's a correct recurrence based on a solution I've seen for similar problems:

dp[i][j] = min(
    dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j] - (1 if s[k] == s[k+1] else 0)
    for all k in i..j-1
)

But this requires that when the split is at k and k+1, and the characters are the same, we can merge their steps.

But how does this apply to the sample input.

Let's compute the sample input step by step.

Sample input: abaca (indices 0-4).

We need to compute dp[0][4}.

Let's build the DP table for all intervals.

Initialize dp[i][i} = 1 for all i.

Now, compute intervals of length 2:

0-1 (ab): since s[0] != s[1}, dp[0][1} = dp[0][0} + dp[1][1} = 1+1=2.

1-2 (ba): s[1} != s[2}, so dp[1][2} = 2.

2-3 (ac): dp[2][3} = 2.

3-4 (ca): dp[3][4} = 2.

Now, intervals of length 3:

0-2 (aba):

s[0} == s[2} (a == a).

Possible options:

Split into 0-0 and 1-2: 1 + 2 = 3.

Split into 0-1 and 2-2: 2 + 1 =3.

Split into 0-2, but since s[0} == s[2}, check if there's a better way.

Alternatively, for s[0} == s[2}, dp[0][2} = min(3, dp[1][1} + 1) = 2.

Because deleting the middle 'b' (step 1), then the a's are merged, so one step. Total steps 1+1=2.

So dp[0][2} = 2.

Similarly, interval 1-3 (bac):

s[1} != s[3}, so split into possible k. The minimal steps would be 3 (1+2, 2+1, etc.), so dp[1][3} = 3.

Interval 2-4 (aca):

s[2} == s[4} (a == a). So dp[2][4} = min( split into parts, or dp[3][3} + 1 = 1+1=2. So dp[2][4} = 2.

Now, intervals of length 4:

0-3 (abac):

s[0} is a, s[3} is c. So no merging. So split into possible k. The minimal steps would be 3 (like 0-2 (2) + 3-3 (1) â†’ 3).

dp[0][3} = 3.

1-4 (baca):

s[1} is b, s[4} is a. So split into possible k. For example, split into 1-2 and 3-4: 2 + 2 =4.

Or other splits. So dp[1][4} = 4.

Finally, the entire interval 0-4 (abaca):

s[0} == s[4} (a == a). So possible options:

- Split into 0-2 and 3-4: 2 + 2 =4. But since s[2} is a and s[3} is c, no merge. So 4.

- Or consider dp[1][3} + 1: 3 +1 =4.

But the sample answer is 3. So this approach isn't working.

Ah! What's missing in the DP approach is that when there's a character in the middle that is the same as the ends, we can split the interval into three parts and combine them.

Wait, for example, in the entire interval 0-4, we can delete the 'b' and 'c' first, which allows the three 'a's to merge. So the steps are:

1. delete 'b' (step 1).

2. delete 'c' (step 2).

3. delete 'aaa' (step 3).

So, how does this split into intervals?

This sequence corresponds to deleting intervals 1-1 (step 1), 3-3 (step 2), then 0-4 (but after deleting those, the 'a's are contiguous).

But how to model this in the DP.

The problem is that the DP[i][j} represents the minimal steps to delete i..j, but in the process of deleting some parts, other parts may become contiguous and thus allow for fewer steps.

But how to model this in the DP.

Another approach is to consider that when we delete a substring in the middle, the remaining parts are still processed as a whole. So, for example, deleting 'b' and 'c' first would make the 'a's contiguous, but the DP approach needs to account for this.

But the DP approach doesn't model the merging of characters after certain deletions. It assumes that the deletions are done in such a way that the remaining string is processed as a whole.

Wait, perhaps the DP approach is correct, but we're missing a transition that allows for combining multiple splits where the same character is present in the middle.

For example, in the case of interval 0-4, there is a middle 'a' at position 2. So perhaps the optimal solution is to split the interval into 0-2 and 3-4. But dp[0][2} is 2, dp[3][4} is 2. So total 4 steps, but the sample's answer is 3.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the recurrence needs to consider all possible positions k where s[k} == s[i}, and then the dp[i][j} can be min( dp[i][k} + dp[k+1][j} - 1 ).

For example, if s[i} == s[k}, then deleting i..k} and k+1..j} can be done with one less step, since the i and k} parts can be merged.

But how?

Alternatively, for any k in i..j where s[k} == s[i}, we can consider:

dp[i][j} = min( dp[i][j}, dp[i+1][k} + dp[k+1][j} )

Because if we delete the i+1 to k} part first, then the i and k} characters are merged, and can be deleted together.

This is getting very complicated.

Alternatively, here's a different approach inspired by the optimal solution for this problem.

The problem is similar to the problem of optimally removing all characters by merging adjacent sections. The optimal solution uses DP where the transition is:

dp[i][j} = min( dp[i][j}, dp[i][k} + dp[k+1][j} )

And also, if s[i} == s[k}, then:

dp[i][j} = min( dp[i][j}, dp[i+1][k-1} + dp[k][j} )

This allows for cases where the same character is in the middle.

Alternatively, here's the correct recurrence:

For each interval i..j:

The minimal steps are:

1. If i > j: 0.

2. If i == j: 1.

3. Otherwise, the minimal steps are the minimum of:

   a. dp[i+1][j} + 1 (delete s[i} first, then the rest).

   b. dp[i][j-1} + 1 (delete s[j} first, then the rest).

   c. For every k in i+1 to j where s[i} == s[k}, then:

      dp[i+1][k-1} + dp[k][j} (delete the middle part between i and k, then merge i and k into one block, which is handled by dp[k][j} )

   d. For every k in i to j-1 where s[k} == s[j}, then:

      dp[i][k} + dp[k+1][j-1} (similar to above)

This is a bit involved, but let's see how it works.

In the sample input's case of 0-4 (a b a c a):

We want to compute dp[0][4}.

The options are:

a. dp[1][4} +1 â†’ 4 +1 =5.

b. dp[0][3} +1 â†’ 3+1=4.

c. Look for k in 0+1 to 4 where s[0} == s[k}.

The characters at positions 0 is 'a', so positions 2 and 4 in 1..4.

For k=2 (s[2} is 'a'):

dp[i+1][k-1} = dp[1][1} (steps 1).

Then dp[k][j} = dp[2][4} (steps 2).

So total steps 1+2=3.

So option c. would give us 3, which is better than a and b.

So this leads to the correct answer.

So the recurrence must include this possibility.

So the recurrence for dp[i][j} is:

dp[i][j} = min(
    dp[i+1][j} + 1,
    dp[i][j-1} + 1,
    min(
        dp[i+1][k-1} + dp[k][j} for all k in i+1 to j where s[i} == s[k}
    ),
    min(
        dp[i][k} + dp[k+1][j-1} for all k in i to j-1 where s[j} == s[k}
    )
)

This way, for each possible k where s[i} == s[k}, we can delete the middle part (i+1 to k-1), then merge i and k into a single block, which is handled by dp[k][j}.

Similarly, for s[j} == s[k}, we can delete the middle part (k+1 to j-1) and merge.

This seems like the correct approach.

So for the sample input:

dp[0][4} is computed as min(5,4, 3, ...) where the third option (k=2) gives 3.

Thus, the answer is 3.

So the key is to consider all possible k where s[i} == s[k} or s[j} == s[k} and split accordingly.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^3), which for n=500 would be 500^3 = 125 million operations. But with optimizations, this should be manageable within 3 seconds.

Now, the implementation of this DP.

The steps are:

Initialize a 2D array dp of size n x n.

Fill the dp[i][i} = 1.

For lengths l from 2 to n:

   For each i in 0 to n-l:

       j = i + l -1.

       Initialize dp[i][j} to the minimum of:

           dp[i+1][j} +1,

           dp[i][j-1} +1.

       Then, for k in i+1 to j:

           if s[i} == s[k}:

               if k == i+1:

                   current = 1 + dp[k][j}

               else:

                   current = dp[i+1][k-1} + dp[k][j}

               dp[i][j} = min(dp[i][j}, current)

       Similarly, for k in i to j-1:

           if s[j} == s[k}:

               if k == j-1:

                   current = 1 + dp[i][k}

               else:

                   current = dp[i][k} + dp[k+1][j-1}

               dp[i][j} = min(dp[i][j}, current)

But this would involve checking all k for each i and j, leading to O(n^3) time.

Now, let's think about the implementation.

In Python, using a memoization approach or a bottom-up DP.

But for Python, a nested loop approach with n=500 is feasible, but 500^3 is 125,000,000 operations, which is manageable.

But Python is slower than C++ for loops, so we need to optimize as much as possible.

But for the given constraints (3 seconds), Python should handle it.

Let's proceed with the code.

So the code would be:

Read n and s.

Initialize a 2D list dp with dimensions n x n, filled with 0.

For i in range(n):

   dp[i][i] = 1.

For length in range(2, n+1):

   for i in range(n - length + 1):

       j = i + length -1

       # Initial min is the minimum of deleting i or j first

       current_min = min(dp[i+1][j] + 1, dp[i][j-1] + 1)

       # Check for k between i and j where s[i] == s[k]

       for k in range(i+1, j+1):

           if s[i] == s[k]:

               if k == i+1:

                   temp = 1 + dp[k][j]

               else:

                   temp = dp[i+1][k-1] + dp[k][j]

               current_min = min(current_min, temp)

       # Check for k between i and j-1 where s[j] == s[k]

       for k in range(i, j):

           if s[j] == s[k]:

               if k == j-1:

                   temp = 1 + dp[i][k]

               else:

                   temp = dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j-1]

               current_min = min(current_min, temp)

       dp[i][j] = current_min

Finally, print(dp[0][n-1}.

But this code might not work for some cases, and perhaps there's a mistake in the transitions.

Let's test it on the sample input.

Sample input 1:

n=5, s=abaca â†’ indexes 0:a,1:b,2:a,3:c,4:a.

For i=0, j=4, length=5.

current_min is initially min(dp[1][4} +1, dp[0][3} +1).

We need to compute dp[1][4} and dp[0][3}.

But let's see:

For i=0, j=4:

Check k from i+1=1 to j=4.

k=1: s[0] is a, s[1} is b â†’ no.

k=2: s[0} == s[2} (a == a).

So:

k=2 is i+1=1? No, i=0, k=2.

Wait, in this case, i+1 is 1, and k ranges from i+1=1 to j=4.

So for k=2:

if s[0} == s[2} â†’ yes.

Compute temp:

since k is not i+1 (0+1=1), but k=2.

So dp[i+1][k-1} is dp[1][1} (1 step).

dp[k][j} is dp[2][4} (which is 2 steps).

So temp = 1 + 2 = 3.

So current_min is min(4, 3) â†’ 3.

Then, for other k values:

k=4: s[0} == s[4} â†’ a == a.

So compute temp: i+1=1, k-1=3. dp[1][3} is 3 steps. dp[4][4} is 1. So temp = 3 + 1 =4. So current_min remains 3.

So after checking all k in i+1 to j, current_min is 3.

Then check for k in i to j-1 (0 to 3) where s[j} (s[4}=a) == s[k}.

k=0: s[0} is a â†’ yes.

Compute temp: if k == j-1 (3) â†’ no. So temp = dp[i][k} (dp[0][0} =1) + dp[k+1][j-1} (dp[1][3} =3) â†’ 1+3=4. current_min remains 3.

k=2: s[2} is a â†’ yes.

So temp = dp[0][2} (2) + dp[3][3} (1) â†’ 3. So current_min is min(3,3) â†’3.

k=4 is not in j-1=3.

So after checking all k in i to j-1, the current_min remains 3.

So dp[0][4} =3, which matches the sample.

Great. So this approach works for the first sample.

The second sample input is:

8

abcddcba

The output is 4.

Let's see:

The string is a b c d d c b a.

The optimal steps are 4.

According to the DP approach:

The code should compute dp[0][7} =4.

But verifying this would take time.

But the code should handle it correctly.

Thus, the code seems correct.

Now, the code in Python:

We need to implement the DP as described.

But we need to note that the DP is filled for all lengths from 1 to n.

So, in Python:

Testing against sample input 1.

def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

            j = i + length -1

            # Initial case: delete left or right first
            current = min(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]) +1

            # Check for k > i where s[i] == s[k]
