Okay, let's see. I need to determine if it's possible to transform string a into string b using those two operations. The operations are appending the parity of a or removing the first character. Hmm. Let's think about how these operations work.

First, the parity operation appends 0 or 1 depending on the current number of 1s in the string. The parity is computed when the operation is performed. Then, the remove operation takes the first character off. But you can't remove from an empty string.

So the problem is to find a sequence of these operations that turns a into b. Let's think about possible approaches.

The key here is to model the possible transformations. But since the operations can be applied multiple times, and in any order (as long as possible), we need to find a way to model possible states and see if we can reach b from a.

But considering that the length of a can vary, and the maximum possible lengths are 1000, a brute-force BFS approach might not be feasible because the state space could be huge. So we need a smarter approach.

Wait, let's think about the operations. Let's see:

The append operation adds a character (0 or 1) to the end. The parity is determined by the current string. So after appending, the length increases by 1.

The remove operation removes the first character. So after each remove, the length decreases by 1. But you can't perform remove if the string is empty.

But how can these operations interact? For example, after appending several times and then removing some characters, maybe the string can take various forms.

Wait, the key observation here is that once you start removing characters from the front, the order of the remaining characters is fixed. Because removing is only from the front. So for example, if you have a string s of length n, removing the first character gives s[1:], and subsequent removes would take more from the front.

So, let's consider that the target string b must be a substring of some string obtained by appending parity bits and then possibly trimming the front.

Wait, here's an idea. Let's think of the possible suffixes of a after some appends and trims.

Let's think in reverse. Suppose we have b as the target. How can we reach it from a? Well, maybe it's easier to model the possible ways to build up b by considering possible prefixes. Or perhaps think of the process forward.

Alternative approach: For the target string b to be reachable from a, it must be possible that after some number of appends and removals, the current string equals b.

Let's model the possible steps. The operations can be applied in any order, but the problem is to find any sequence that leads from a to b.

Let me think about the possible steps:

Each time, you can either append the parity or remove the first character.

But appending and then removing might not be useful. For example, appending adds a character, then removing the first characterâ€”this could be part of a process of transforming the string.

Wait, but when you append, you can only add a parity bit. So perhaps the way to approach this is to consider that after some appends, the string a becomes longer, and then you can remove characters from the front until you get to the desired length.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is:

1. Append some number of parity bits (0 or 1 each time, based on the current string's parity). Let's say after k appends, the string is a followed by k parity bits. Each parity bit depends on the parity of the string before appending.

2. Then, remove some number of characters from the front. The total number of removals must be such that the remaining string is exactly b.

Alternatively, maybe the process is a combination of appending and removing, but perhaps the optimal way is to first append all possible parity bits and then remove from the front. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the order of operations matters. For example, you can append once, then remove once, then append again, etc. So the sequence can be arbitrary.

But considering all possible sequences is not feasible. So perhaps there's a pattern here that allows us to check if b can be formed by some number of appends followed by some number of removes, or appends and removes in some order.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to check for all possible possible positions where the target string b can be a suffix of a after some appends and trims.

Let me think. Let's say that during the process, the string is built by appending some bits (each being the parity of the current string at that step), then possibly removing some bits from the front to reach the desired length.

Wait, but removing can happen at any time. For example, suppose a is "01011" and the target is "0110". The example given works as follows:

Original a is "01011". Then remove first character (0), getting "1011". Then remove first character (1) to get "011", then append parity (which is 0) to get "0110". So in this case, there's a combination of removes and appends.

Hmm, so the order is important. So perhaps the approach is to generate all possible possible strings that can be formed by any number of appends and removes, and see if b is among them. But this is not feasible for large a and b.

So what's the alternative? Let's think of the possible ways the string can be modified.

Let me consider that the append operation is adding a parity bit. Each time you append, the parity bit depends on the current string's parity. So, each append is deterministic once you know the current parity.

But the remove operation can be applied multiple times, leading to different prefixes.

Wait, here's an idea: For the process, when you append, you can generate a new string by adding a parity bit. Then, any number of removes can be done (as long as possible) to get a substring. But perhaps the key is to find a way to build the target string b by appending some bits and then trimming the front, or a combination.

Alternatively, let's model the process as:

We start with a. We can perform any number of appends and removes, but each append adds a parity bit (determined by the current string's parity), and each remove takes the first character.

So the problem is to find a sequence of these operations leading to b.

But how to model this efficiently?

Alternative approach: The target string b must be a substring of a string formed by appending some parity bits to a, then possibly some more parity bits, and so on, with possible removals in between.

But perhaps the main idea is that after some appends, the string must end with a suffix that, when some characters are removed from the front, equals b.

Wait, but when you append parity bits, each bit depends on the parity of the entire current string. So the sequence of appended bits is determined by the initial a, and then each append step's parity.

But perhaps for each possible number of appends (k), we can compute the possible string after appending k bits. Then, check if the target string b is a substring of that extended string, starting from some position.

But the problem is that the appends are done in sequence, each time adding a parity bit. So the first append adds the parity of a. Then the second append adds the parity of a + first parity bit. So the parity bits form a sequence determined by the initial string and previous appends.

So for example, if the initial string is '0', then after appending, the parity of '0' is 1 (since there's 1 '1'), so the new string is '01'. Then appending again, the parity of '01' is 1 (since there's 1 '1'), so it becomes '011'. Then appending again, parity is 0 (two 1s), so '0110', etc.

So each append is deterministic based on the current string's parity. So the sequence of appends is fixed once the initial string is known and the number of appends is chosen.

Thus, for each possible number of appends (k), we can compute the extended string (a followed by k parity bits). Then, for each possible k, check if b is a substring of this extended string, possibly after removing some characters from the front. But how to check this.

Wait, but after appending k bits, the extended string is a followed by k bits. The total length is len(a) + k. Then, to form the target b, which has length m, we need to remove (len(a) + k - m) characters from the front. Because the target's length is m, so the extended string's length must be at least m. So len(a) + k - (number of removes) = m. But the number of removes can't exceed len(a) +k - m, but also, the number of removes must be such that the remaining string is exactly b.

So for a given k (number of appends), the required number of removes is (current_length - m) = (len(a) +k - m). But current_length must be >= m. So len(a) +k >= m. So k >= m - len(a). But k can't be negative. So possible k is from max(0, m - len(a)) to ... ?

Wait, but for each possible k (number of appends), we can generate the extended string (a followed by k parity bits), then check if the substring starting at position (len(a) +k - m) is equal to b. Because that's the number of characters you need to remove from the front to get a string of length m.

Wait, for example, if the extended string is S, which has length n, and the target is m. Then, if you remove (n - m) characters from the front, you get the last m characters. But perhaps this is not the case. Because the remove operations are done one by one. So each remove takes the first character. So after (n - m) removes, the string is S[(n - m):], which is the last m characters.

So for the extended string S (after k appends) to have a substring of length m at the end, which is exactly b, then S's last m characters must be b.

But also, the extended string S must have exactly m + (n - m) = n. So for S to be a possible candidate, after appending k times, len(a) +k >= m, and the substring starting at position (len(a) +k - m) of S is equal to b.

So the approach could be:

1. Precompute all possible extended strings for k appends. Since each append is deterministic, for each k, we can compute the parity bits step by step.

2. For each possible k (starting from 0 up to some maximum), compute the extended string, then check if the substring of length m (the length of b) starting at (len(a) +k - m) is equal to b.

But the problem is that k could be up to a very large number, but given the constraints (a and b up to 1000 characters), perhaps we can limit k to a reasonable number.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the maximum allowed a and b lengths are 1000. So let's think: For the target b to be formed from a via some appends and removals.

The minimal k needed is such that len(a) +k >= m. Because after appending k times, you can then remove (len(a) +k -m) characters from the front. So for each possible k where len(a) +k >= m and len(a) +k - m <= len(a) +k (which is obvious), we can check if the last m characters of the extended string (after k appends) equals b.

Wait, but the extended string after k appends is a followed by k bits. So the substring starting at position (len(a) +k - m) is the last m characters. So yes, the check is whether the last m characters of the extended string (after k appends) equals b.

But what about k being up to some maximum? For example, if after a certain number of appends, the parity starts to cycle. For example, appending 0, then 1, then 0, etc. So the sequence of parity bits can cycle, leading to repeating patterns.

But the problem is that even if we have a cycle, the extended string's last m characters could repeat in a certain way, so perhaps we need to check all possible k up to a certain point where the parities start repeating.

Alternatively, since the maximum length of b is 1000, perhaps for k up to len(b) + len(a) steps, we can compute the possible extended strings and check. But even that could be computationally feasible.

Wait, but for each possible k, the maximum possible number is when len(a) +k >= m. Since m can be up to 1000, len(a) can be up to 1000, so k can be up to 1000 + 1000 = 2000. But even that might be manageable.

So the plan is:

For each possible k in 0 to (m + len(a)), compute the extended string after k appends, and check if the last m characters match b, and that the number of appends plus the original length of a is >= m.

Wait, but len(a) +k must be >= m. So for each k where len(a) +k >= m, check if the last m characters of the extended string (a + appends) equals b.

If any of these k's satisfies this condition, then output yes.

But also, there's another possibility: after appending some bits and then removing some bits, perhaps you can append more bits. For example, append once, then remove once, then append again, then remove, etc. This would allow the extended string to have a certain pattern.

But in such cases, the resulting string after these operations would be built by appending some parity bits based on the current string, but after some removes.

This complicates things. Because the parity bits are determined by the current string at the time of appending.

But perhaps the key insight is that any appends must be done on the original string (or a suffix of it after some removes) plus previous appends. Wait, but when you remove the first character, the string changes, so any appends after that would be based on the new string's parity.

This is getting complicated. So the initial approach of checking for all possible k (number of appends) may not cover all possibilities, because appends can be done in between removes.

But maybe that initial approach is sufficient. Let's see.

Suppose that the optimal way to reach b is to first append all k parity bits and then remove the necessary characters from the front. Then the approach would work. But what if some appends are done after some removes?

For example, suppose after appending once, then remove once, then append again. Then the extended string is a followed by the first parity bit, then after removing the first character, the string is a[1:] + parity(a), then append parity of that new string.

In this case, the extended string after two appends would not be the same as appending two times on the original a. So the initial approach of appending all possible k times and then checking the suffix would miss this possibility.

Ah, so the initial approach is insufficient because it only considers appending all parity bits first and then trimming. But in reality, appends and removes can be interleaved, leading to different sequences of parity bits.

Thus, the problem becomes more complex. So what's the correct way to model all possible sequences of operations?

Alternative idea: Let's model the possible states as a tuple of (current_string, parity). But since the current_string can be up to 1000 + some appends, this may be too memory-intensive.

But the problem allows up to len(a) and len(b) of 1000. So if the current string's length is up to 2000, then the state space could be 2000 * 2 (parity) = 4000 possible states. Because the parity is determined by the current string.

Wait, but the parity is 0 or 1. So for a given parity, the current string can have varying lengths and contents. But the parity is just the sum of 1's mod 2.

Wait, but perhaps the key is that when you append a parity bit, it's the parity of the current string. So after appending, the new string's parity is (current_parity + parity_bit) mod 2. But since the parity_bit is equal to the current_parity, the new parity is (current_parity + current_parity) mod 2 = 0. Then, the next append would add the parity of the new string (which is 0), leading to parity 0, etc. So appending multiple times can lead to a cycle in the parity bits.

Wait, wait. Let's think: suppose the current string has parity p. Appending p changes the parity. Because the new string is original string + p. The number of 1's in the new string is the original count plus p. So the new parity is (original_parity + p) mod 2. Since original_parity is p, the new parity is (p + p) mod 2 = 0. So after each append, the parity becomes 0.

Wait, wait. Let's see:

Original string parity is p. Append p. Then the new string's parity is (number of 1s in original + p) mod 2. Which is (p + p) mod 2 = 0.

So after appending once, the new parity is 0. Then, appending again: the parity of the new string is 0, so append 0. The parity of the new string (after appending 0) is (0 + 0) mod 2 = 0. So appending again appends 0 again. So after the first append, any subsequent appends add 0s.

Ah! That's a key insight. Let me recheck.

Suppose the current parity is p. Then the appended bit is p. The new parity is (current parity + p) mod 2 = 0. Then, the next append adds 0 (the new parity is 0). So appending again adds 0, and the parity remains 0. So after the first append, all further appends add 0. So the appended bits after the first one are all 0s.

So the sequence of appends after the first one adds 0s. So, for example:

Original string parity is 1. Append 1. Now parity is 0. Append 0. Parity remains 0. Append 0. Etc.

Another example:

Original parity is 0. Append 0. Now parity is (0 +0) mod 2 =0. Append 0. Parity remains 0. So all appends after the first one add 0s.

Wait, but in the first append, the parity is p, and after appending p, the parity becomes 0. So regardless of the initial p, after the first append, the parity is 0. Then any further appends add 0, and the parity remains 0.

So the sequence of appends would be:

After k appends:

The first append adds p (the initial parity of a).

Then, each subsequent append adds 0.

So for example, if the initial parity of a is p, then after appending k times, the appended bits are p followed by (k-1) zeros.

So this is a crucial observation. So the appended bits are determined as follows: the first append adds the parity of a, and then all subsequent appends add 0. Because after the first append, the parity is 0, so all further appends add 0.

So the extended string after appending k times is a + p + (k-1)*0, where p is the initial parity of a.

Wait, but wait. Let's test this.

Original a is "01011". Let's compute the initial parity. The number of 1's is 3, which is odd. So p is 1. So appending once gives "010111". The new parity is (3+1) mod 2 = 0. So next append adds 0, making the string "0101110". Then append again, parity is (3+1+0) mod 2 = 0, so append 0. So the appended bits are 1, then 0, then 0, etc.

So yes, the first append adds the initial parity, then the rest add 0.

So this is a critical insight. Therefore, the number of appends can be modeled as follows:

The first append adds the parity of the current string (which is the initial a's parity).

Then, each subsequent append adds 0.

But wait, what if you perform some removes in between appends? For example, append once, remove once, then append again. How does that affect the parity?

Let me see.

Suppose initial a is "0" (parity 0). Append once: "00" (parity 0). Then remove once: "0". Then append again: parity of "0" is 0, so append 0. So the new string is "00".

But according to the previous model, the first append added 0, then subsequent appends add 0. So in this case, the model holds.

But what if after removing, the string's parity changes? For example:

Original a is "01011" (parity 1). Append once: "010111" (parity 0). Then remove once: "10111". The parity of this new string is the number of 1s in "10111" is 1+0+1+1+1=4, even. Parity is 0. Then appending again would add 0. So the new string is "101110". The parity of this is 4+0=4, even. So appends add 0.

But in this case, the appends after the remove are based on the current string's parity. But according to the previous model, after the first append, all appends add 0. But in this scenario, after a remove and another append, the appended bit is 0 again. So perhaps the model still holds.

Wait, but in this case, the append after the remove is based on the current string's parity, which is 0. So the appended bit is 0.

So even if after some removes and appends, the model is that any append after the first one adds 0. But this depends on when the appends are done.

Hmm. This complicates things. Because the model where the appended bits are p followed by zeros only holds when the appends are done consecutively. If appends are interleaved with removes, then the appended bits may vary.

But perhaps the key insight is that once you have appended at least once, any further appends (without any removes in between) will add zeros. But if you append and then remove, then append again, the parity of the new string depends on the current string (after the remove) and the appended bit is based on that.

But this seems to make the problem more complex. However, perhaps we can find that the optimal way to form the target string b is to first append some number of times (possibly zero), then remove some number of times, and possibly append more times, but according to the model where after the first append, all further appends add zeros.

Alternatively, perhaps the only possible way to form b is to append a certain number of times (k) and then remove some characters from the front. Because any other sequence of operations (like appends and removes interleaved) would not result in a longer string than the initial appends.

But how to prove this? Let's think of possible scenarios.

Case 1: You append k times, then remove r times, then append m times, then remove s times, etc. But each time you append after removes, you are adding the parity of the current string. Which could be different.

But this leads to a complex situation. So the initial approach of checking all possible k appends (with the first append being the parity of a, followed by zeros) and then checking if b is a suffix of the extended string may miss some cases where appends and removes are interleaved.

But perhaps there's a way to model all possible possible strings that can be obtained through any sequence of operations, but in an efficient way.

Alternative approach:

The key is that after any number of operations, the current string is some substring of the original a with some appends.

Because each remove operation takes the first character, the order of the remaining characters is preserved. Appends add to the end.

So perhaps the current string is a suffix of the original a plus some appended parity bits.

Wait, here's another way to model it. Let's imagine that at any time, the current string is a substring of the original a followed by some appends. Because each append adds to the end, and each remove removes from the front. So the current string is some suffix of the original a plus appended bits.

But this isn't entirely accurate. For example, after appending and then removing, the string is a[1:] + appended_bits, then appending again adds the parity of that string. So the appended bits after that may not be part of the initial appends.

But perhaps, given the model that after the first append, the parity is 0, and any further appends add 0, perhaps even when you have removes, the subsequent appends can be zeros.

But I'm not sure.

This seems to be getting stuck. Let's look for an alternative approach.

Another idea: The problem requires us to check if there exists a sequence of appends and removes such that the final string is b.

Let's consider the possible cases:

Case 1: We perform some appends first, then some removes. So the string is a followed by k appends (which are p, 0, 0, ..., 0). Then, we remove some number of characters from the front, so the resulting string is the suffix of a + appends.

In this case, the target b must be a suffix of a + appends. So the solution is to check for all possible k, and see if the last len(b) characters of a + appends equals b.

Case 2: We perform some removes first, then appends. For example, remove some characters from a, then append some parity bits. Then remove some more characters, etc.

In this case, the appends are based on the current string (after the removes), which is a suffix of a.

So perhaps for case 2, we can model the possible strings as follows: After removing some number of characters from the front of a, we have some suffix of a, say a[i:], then append some parity bits (p_i, then zeros), then remove some characters again, etc.

But this seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.

So the plan is to check all possible ways of removing characters from the front of a (or from a after some appends), and appending parity bits based on the current string.

But how to model this?

Alternative approach:

For any possible suffix of a (after some removes), we can compute the possible appends (p followed by zeros), and see if after appending some bits and removing some more, we can get to b.

But the problem is that the number of possible suffixes can be large. For example, a of length 1000 has 1000 possible suffixes (each starting at a different position).

But since len(b) can be up to 1000, perhaps we can model this as follows:

For each possible start index i in a (0 <= i <= len(a)), representing that we have removed i characters from the front, resulting in the current string s = a[i:].

Then, for each such s, compute the possible appends (k times, which adds p followed by zeros, where p is the parity of s). Then, after appending k times, check if the suffix of s + appends equals b, and if the total length is sufficient.

But even this approach could be manageable.

Because for each possible start index i (up to len(a)), and for each possible k (number of appends), we can compute the extended string for s = a[i:], appending k times. Then check if the last len(b) characters of s + appends equals b.

But len(a) is up to 1000, and for each i, the possible k can be up to len(b) + len(s) (since len(s) +k >= len(b)).

But len(b) is up to 1000. So for each i in 0..len(a), and for k up to 1000 + (len(a) -i), this would be 1000 * 1000 = 1e6 possibilities. Which is manageable.

So the steps would be:

For each i in 0 to len(a):

   current_s = a[i:]

   for k in 0 to (len(b) + len(current_s)):

      compute the extended string by appending k times.

      the appended bits are:

         if k ==0: nothing.

         else: first append p (parity of current_s), then append k-1 0's.

      extended_s = current_s + (p if k >=1 else '') + '0'*(k-1)

      check if len(extended_s) >= len(b)

      if yes, then check if extended_s ends with b.

      if yes, return YES.

Also, for each i and k, the required number of removes after appending k times is (i + (len(a) -i) +k) - len(b) = (len(a) -i) +k - len(b) + i = len(a) +k - len(b). Wait, no:

Wait, the extended_s has length len(current_s) + k = (len(a) -i) +k.

To get a string of length len(b), you need to remove (len(current_s) +k) - len(b) = (len(a) -i +k) - len(b) characters from the front. But the removes must have been possible, which requires that after each step, the string is not empty. So the total number of removes must be such that:

i (initial removes) + (possible removes after appending) = ?

Wait, perhaps this approach is not considering that after appending, we can also perform removes. But perhaps the approach is to model all possible sequences where:

We remove i characters from the original a, leading to current_s = a[i:].

Then append k parity bits (as per the rules: first the parity of current_s, then 0's).

Then remove m characters from the front of the extended string (current_s + appends) to get a string of length len(b).

The total removes from the front of the extended string would be m = (len(current_s) +k) - len(b).

So the resulting string would be (current_s + appends)[m:] = (a[i:] + appends)[m:].

But m must be >=0 and <= len(current_s) +k.

So for this to be possible, len(current_s) +k >= len(b) and m = len(current_s) +k - len(b) >=0.

The resulting string is (current_s + appends)[m:].

If this string equals b, then return YES.

So the algorithm would be:

For each i in 0..len(a):

   current_s = a[i:]

   possible_k = 0, 1, ... up to len(b) + len(current_s) (or even up to len(b) + 1000 to cover all possibilities)

   for each possible k in 0,1,...:

      compute appends.

      appends = ''

      if k >0:

          p = parity(current_s)

          appends = p + '0'*(k-1)

      extended = current_s + appends

      required_m = len(extended) - len(b)

      if required_m <0:

          continue

      if len(extended) < len(b):

          continue

      candidate = extended[required_m : ]

      if candidate == b:

          return YES

So for each i and k, we generate the extended string (current_s + appends), check if the last len(b) characters equal b.

If any of these possibilities is true, output YES. Otherwise, after checking all possibilities, output NO.

This approach should cover all possible ways of combining removes and appends. Because the i represents the number of initial removes from a, then appending k times (according to the parity of current_s and then 0's), then removing m = (len(extended) - len(b)) characters from the front of the extended string.

Yes, because the removes after appending are allowed as long as the string isn't empty. So the total removes from the extended string would be m = (len(current_s) +k) - len(b). For this to be possible, m must be >=0 and the resulting string is of length len(b).

But in code, we can check whether the candidate is equal to b.

This approach should handle all possible combinations of appends and removes, including interleaved ones. Because the initial removes (i) represent any number of removes done before any appends. Then appends are done as per the rules. Then further removes are done to reach the target length.

So, for example, in the first sample input:

a = 01011 (length 5)

b = 0110 (length 4)

The sample solution is to:

1. Remove 1 character (i=1), getting 1011.

Then append 0 (parity of 1011 is 3 mod 2 =1, but wait, 1011 has three 1's? So parity is 1. Then append 1. Then remove one character (10111 becomes 0111?), then append 0.

Wait, no. Let's think according to the algorithm.

In the sample, the steps are:

Original a: 01011 â†’ remove first character (i=1) â†’ 1011 (current_s). Then append parity of current_s (parity of 1011 is 3 mod 2 =1 â†’ appended bit is 1. Then the extended string is 10111. Then remove the first character â†’ 0111. Then append parity of 0111 â†’ parity is 3 mod 2=1 â†’ appended 1. Then remove first character â†’ 111. Then append parity of 111 â†’ 1 â†’ appended 1. Then remove first character â†’ 11. Then append parity â†’ 0. So becomes 110. But that's not matching the example.

Wait, perhaps the algorithm's approach would find the correct case.

In the sample input, the correct sequence is:

01011 â†’ remove first character (i=1) â†’ 1011 â†’ remove first character (i=2) â†’ 011 â†’ append parity (parity of 011 is 2 mod 2=0 â†’ append 0 â†’ 0110 â†’ which equals b.

In the algorithm, for i=1 (current_s is 1011), and k=0 appends. Then extended string is 1011. len(b) is 4. So required_m is 4-4=0. So candidate is 1011 â†’ not equal to 0110.

Then k=1. Appended bit is parity of 1011 (3 1's â†’ parity 1). Appended bit is '1'. extended string is 10111. required_m is 5-4=1. So candidate is 0111. Not equal to 0110.

k=0, i=2: current_s is '011'. len(b) is 4. So required_m = 3 +0 -4 = -1 â†’ invalid.

k=1 for i=2: extended string is '011' + parity. Parity of '011' is 2 mod 2=0. So appends '0'. extended is '0110', len 4. required_m is 0. candidate is '0110' â†’ matches. So yes.

So in this case, i=2 (removing two characters from a) and k=1 append. Then required_m is 0. So the candidate is '0110' equals b.

Thus, the algorithm would find this case.

So the algorithm correctly handles this case.

Now, let's see how to implement this.

First, precompute all possible i (from 0 to len(a)).

For each i, current_s is a[i:].

Then, for each possible k (number of appends). The maximum k needed would be such that len(current_s) +k >= len(b). Because required_m must be >=0. So k >= len(b) - len(current_s). But k can be zero or more.

But for k up to len(b) + 1000 (or some upper limit), but considering that after the first append, appends are zeros. So for a current_s of length l, appending k times would give a string of length l +k. To get len(b), required_m = (l +k) - len(b) must be >=0. So the candidate is the last len(b) characters.

But if k is large enough, the appends are all zeros. So the candidate becomes current_s followed by p (parity of current_s) followed by k-1 zeros. Then, the last len(b) characters would be the end of current_s + p + zeros.

But even for large k, the last len(b) characters would be a combination of the end of current_s, p, and zeros.

So perhaps for each i, k can be up to len(b) + len(current_s), but in practice, after a certain k, the appends are all zeros, so adding more zeros may not change the last len(b) characters. For example, if len(b) is 4, and after appending some zeros, the last 4 characters are all zeros. Adding more zeros would keep the last 4 as zeros. So we can limit the maximum k for each i to len(current_s) + len(b) + 1 or something like that. But since len(a) and len(b) are up to 1000, even checking up to k=2000 for each i would be manageable.

Alternatively, for each i, compute the maximum k needed as len(b) + 1. Because after that, appending more zeros won't change the last len(b) characters. Wait, let's see:

Suppose current_s is 'abc', len(current_s) is 3. len(b) is 5. So required_m is 3 +k -5 >=0 â†’ k >= 2. For k=2, the appends are p and 0. For k=3: p, 0, 0. The last 5 characters could be 'c p 0 0 0' (if 3 +k >=5). But perhaps for larger k, the last len(b) characters would consist of the end of current_s, p, and zeros. So, the maximum k we need to check is such that the appends contribute len(b) characters. For example, if current_s is empty (after i=len(a)), then appends must be len(b) characters. So for current_s of length l, the maximum k is len(b) - l (if l is small), but not sure.

But perhaps for each i, we can check k up to len(b) +1. Because after that, adding more zeros won't change the last len(b) characters. For example, if len(current_s) +k is larger than len(b), and the appends are zeros beyond the first one.

But perhaps this is getting too complicated. So in code, for each i in 0 to len(a):

   current_s = a[i:]

   l = len(current_s)

   required_len = len(b)

   max_k = required_len + 1000  # or some arbitrary large number to cover all possibilities.

   for k in 0 to max_k:

       if l +k < required_len:

           continue

       # compute appends

       if k ==0:

           appends = ''

       else:

           p = parity(current_s)  # compute once for current_s

           appends = str(p) + '0'*(k-1)

       extended = current_s + appends

       m = len(extended) - required_len

       if m <0:

           continue

       candidate = extended[m:]

       if candidate == b:

           return 'YES'

So in code, for each i and k up to a certain max_k, compute the extended string and check.

But what about cases where appends are interleaved with removes? For example, append once, remove once, append once, etc. How does this fit into the model?

In the code's approach, this is modeled by considering that after initial removes (i) and appends (k), the remaining removes (m) are done in one step. So the code's approach is essentially considering all possible combinations of initial removes, appends, and then final removes. However, in reality, appends and removes can be interleaved. But the code's approach may not capture all possible interleavings.

But wait, is there a scenario where the code's approach would miss a valid sequence?

For example, consider a scenario where you:

1. Append once (k=1) to a â†’ a+p.

2. Remove once (i=1) â†’ s = a[1:] +p.

3. Append once (k=1) based on s's parity â†’ s + p'.

4. Remove some characters (m) to reach b.

But in the code's approach, this would be modeled as:

i=1 (remove 1 character from a), then append k=2 times. Wait, no. Because in the code, k is the number of appends after the initial removes. So in step 3, the append is part of k=1 for the current_s = a[1:]. So the code would generate appends = p' followed by k-1=0 zeros. So the extended string would be a[1:] + p' + '0'*(0) = a[1:] + p'. Then, the code would check if the last len(b) characters of this extended string equals b.

But in the actual scenario, after the first append and remove, the string is a[1:] + p, then append p' (the parity of a[1:] + p), then remove m characters to reach b.

So in the code's approach, this would require i=1 (current_s is a[1:]), k=2 appends. The appends would be p (parity of current_s) followed by 1 zero (k-1=1). So the extended string is a[1:] + p + '0'. But in the actual scenario, the appends are p and p'.

But this may not be captured.

Ah, this is a problem. Because in the code's approach, the appends are always p followed by zeros. But when you interleave appends and removes, the appends after the initial removes would have different parities. For example, current_s is a[1:] + p. Then, append once: the parity is the parity of current_s (a[1:] + p). Which could be 0 or 1. So the appends after that would start with p_new followed by zeros.

Thus, the code's approach of considering i and k for each initial i is not capturing appends that are done after a sequence of removes and appends.

So the code's approach may miss some cases.

This is a critical flaw in the initial approach.

So, the code's approach only considers appends after initial removes (i), but not appends after subsequent removes (which would require different i values and k appends).

Thus, the code may not cover all possible cases.

This suggests that the code's approach is insufficient and may fail certain test cases.

But how can we model all possible cases where appends and removes are interleaved?

Alternative idea: The code's approach can be modified to consider multiple stages of appends and removes, but this may lead to a combinatorial explosion.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to model the process as a finite state machine, where each state is represented by the current string and the parity, but this seems impossible due to the infinite possibilities of the current string.

Another idea: The parity after each append is determined. So perhaps the key is that each append is either adding a 0 or 1, and the parity of the current string after each operation.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering that after any number of appends and removes, the current string must be a suffix of a followed by some appends.

Because each append adds to the end, and each remove takes from the front. So the current string is a suffix of the original a plus appends.

But appends can be done at any time, so the appends can be interleaved with removes. For example:

Append once â†’ remove once â†’ append once â†’ remove once â†’ append once.

This would result in a string that is a suffix of the original a plus appends, but the appends are done in stages.

But how to model this?

Alternatively, perhaps the current string after any sequence of operations is a suffix of a followed by some appends. But the appends can be a combination of multiple appends done after various removes.

But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved by considering all possible possible ways to generate the target string by:

- Removing some characters from the front of a.

- Appending some parity bits based on the current string.

- Removing some characters from the front of the appended string.

- And so on.

But this seems to require a BFS approach.

So perhaps the BFS approach is manageable.

Each state can be represented by the current string and the current parity (which is the parity of the current string). But since the parity is determined by the current string, we can compute it on the fly.

But the problem is that the current string can be up to 1000 + appends, which could be up to 2000 characters. Storing these strings in a BFS queue may be memory-intensive, but perhaps feasible given the constraints.

But the time limit is 1 second, and the maximum possible states are:

For each possible current string length up to, say, 2000, and the parity is either 0 or 1. But since the current string can be any possible string of varying length, the state space is potentially huge.

Alternatively, perhaps the BFS can be optimized by noting that once a string is shorter than the target string, appending is required to reach the target's length. But even this may not help.

Alternatively, considering that the maximum length of the target is 1000, perhaps the BFS can be limited to strings up to length 1000 + some appends.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, here's a BFS approach:

Each state is represented by the current string. For each state, we can perform two possible operations:

1. Append the parity of the current string.

2. Remove the first character (if the string is not empty).

We need to find if there's a path from a to b.

But given that a and b can be up to 1000 characters, this BFS is not feasible for large strings.

For example, if a is 1000 characters and b is 1000 characters, the BFS would have to process strings of various lengths, up to 1000 + appends. But appends can make the string longer.

But the problem is that the BFS can generate very long strings, which would be impossible to handle within the memory and time constraints.

Thus, the BFS approach is not feasible.

Therefore, the initial approach is the best we can do, but it may miss some cases where appends and removes are interleaved.

But according to the sample input, the initial approach can handle some cases. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the other cases are covered by the model.

But why would that be the case?

Perhaps the parity appends after any sequence of removes can be modeled by considering all possible initial removes (i) and appends (k). Because the appends after initial removes are based on the parity of the current string, which is a suffix of the original a.

Thus, the initial approach covers all possible appends after any number of removes. Because for each possible i (number of initial removes), we compute the appends based on the current string (a[i:]), which is the string after removing i characters.

Thus, the code's approach should cover all possible scenarios. Because any sequence of appends and removes can be represented as:

1. Remove some i characters from a.

2. Append k times (according to the parity of a[i:] and then zeros).

3. Remove m characters from the resulting string to reach b.

This is because any appends done after removes are covered by different i values.

For example, if you append once, then remove once, then append once, this is equivalent to:

- Original a is S.

- Remove once (i=1), appending k=0 times.

- Then append once (k=1) on S[1:], resulting in S[1:] + p.

- Then remove m characters from the extended string.

But this scenario is covered by i=1 and k=1.

Thus, the initial approach covers all possible appends and removes, because any interleaved removes and appends can be represented by a certain i (the total number of removes before any appends) and appends k times, followed by m removes.

But wait, this is not the case. For example:

Original a is S.

Append once (k=1), resulting in S + p.

Remove once (i=1), resulting in S[1:] + p.

Append once (k=1), based on the parity of S[1:] + p.

Remove m characters to reach b.

In the code's approach, this would require:

i=1 (the initial removes), and k=1 appends. So the extended string is (S[1:] + p) + p_new + '0'*(k-1).

But the code would compute p_new as the parity of S[1:], not the parity of S[1:] + p.

Thus, the code's approach would not capture this scenario.

Because after the initial append and remove, the current string is S[1:] + p. Then appending is done based on the parity of this new string.

But in the code's approach, i is 1 (removes done before any appends), and the appends are based on the parity of S[1:], not S[1:] + p.

Thus, the code's approach would not capture the append after the initial append and remove.

Thus, the code's approach is incorrect.

But how to model this?

This is a problem. So the code's approach is missing scenarios where appends are done after some removes and appends.

So the initial approach is incorrect.

Alternative idea: For each possible current string, not just those that are suffixes of a, but any string formed by appends and removes. But this is not feasible for large strings.

Another approach is to realize that the parity of the current string after appends and removes can be tracked, but without tracking the entire string.

Wait, but the string's parity depends on the number of 1's in it. So the parity can be tracked as a state variable, along with the current string's length. But this is insufficient, since the actual characters matter when performing removes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be reduced to tracking the parity and the current string's suffix.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think of the parity after each append. Suppose we model the current string as a suffix of a followed by some appended parity bits.

But appends after removes can change the parity. For example, after appending and then removing, the new string is a suffix of the original a plus appends, but appends after that are based on the new parity.

But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the problem can be solved by realizing that the target string b can be obtained by appending and then removing, or removing and then appending.

But I'm not making progress here.

Let's look for another approach.

The key idea is that each time you append a parity bit, it's determined by the current string's parity. So the parity of the string after the append is 0 (as explained earlier).

Thus, after appending once, any further appends add 0.

So the appended bits after the first append are all 0's.

But this is only true if the appends are done consecutively. If you append once, then remove some characters, then append again, the parity of the new string may be different.

For example:

Original a is '0' (parity 0).

Append once: '0' + '0' (parity 0).

Remove once: '0' (parity 0).

Append once: '0' + '0' (parity 0). So the appended bit is 0.

So the model holds.

Another example:

Original a is '01' (parity 1).

Append once: '011' (parity 1+1 = 2 mod 2 =0).

Remove once: '11' (parity 2 mod 2=0).

Append once: parity is 0 â†’ append 0. So new string is '110' (parity 0+0=0 mod 2=0).

Append again: append 0.

So the appended bits after each append are 0.

Thus, even after removes, appends are adding 0's.

Wait, this seems to be the case. Because after any append, the parity of the new string is 0, and appending again adds 0, which keeps the parity as 0.

So, regardless of when appends are done, each append after the first one adds 0.

Because the first append adds a parity bit (p) based on the current string. The new parity is (current_parity + p) mod 2. But since p is the current_parity, this is (p + p) mod 2 =0.

Then, any subsequent append adds 0, and the parity remains 0.

So the appends after the first one are always 0.

Thus, even if you have interleaved appends and removes, the appended bits after the first one are 0's.

This is a crucial observation.

So, for example:

- Append once (p), then remove some characters, then append again (0), then remove some more, append again (0), etc.

Thus, the sequence of appends would be p followed by any number of 0's, but the 0's can be added in any order as long as the appends are not consecutive.

So, the model where appends are p followed by zeros holds regardless of when the appends are done.

Thus, the initial approach of checking all possible i (initial removes) and appending k times (with the first append being p and the rest being zeros) covers all possible cases.

Thus, the code's approach is correct.

Because even if appends are done after removes, the appended bits after the first append are zeros. So, for any current_s (after initial removes i), appending k times will add p (parity of current_s) followed by k-1 zeros.

Thus, the code's approach is correct.

Thus, the code should work.

Thus, the algorithm is as follows:

For each possible i (initial removes, leading to current_s = a[i:]).

For each possible k (number of appends).

Compute the extended string as current_s + p (if k>=1) + '0'*(k-1).

Check if the last len(b) characters of this extended string equals b.

If any i and k combination satisfies this, return YES.

Else, return NO.

Thus, the code should cover all possible cases.

Now, let's proceed to implement this.

The steps in code:

Read a and b.

If b is longer than a's maximum possible length after appends and removes, then it's impossible. But the code will check all possibilities.

For each i in 0 to len(a):

   current_s = a[i:]

   l = len(current_s)

   if l ==0:

       continue  # can't append when current_s is empty, but in code, when i = len(a), current_s is empty. But appending is allowed.

   # compute parity of current_s once.

   parity_p = current_s.count('1') % 2

   # for k in 0 to len(b) + 1:

   # but len(current_s) +k >= len(b)

   # the maximum k needed is len(b) + len(current_s) + 1, but to avoid infinite loops, set a reasonable upper limit.

   max_k = len(b) + 1  # 1000 is the max len(b), so len(b)+1 is 1001.

   for k in range(0, max_k +1):

       # compute appends.

       appends = ''

       if k >0:

           appends += str(parity_p)

           appends += '0' * (k-1)

       # compute extended string.

       extended = current_s + appends

       required_length = len(b)

       if len(extended) < required_length:

           continue

       m = len(extended) - required_length

       candidate = extended[m:]

       if candidate == b:

           print("YES")

           exit()

print("NO")

Wait, but when current_s is empty (i = len(a)), then current_s is ''. Then, appends can be done (k times), but the parity of current_s (which is empty) is 0 (since no 1's). So appends for k=1 would add '0', then '0's for k>1.

But in code, current_s is empty. Then, appending k=3 times would add '0' + '0' + '0' â†’ '000'.

If b is '000', then this would be covered by i=len(a) and k=3.

Yes.

Thus, the code handles all cases.

Testing the sample input:

Sample 1:

a = '01011' (length 5)

b = '0110' (length 4)

For i=2, current_s is a[2:] â†’ '011'.

current_s.count('1') is 2 â†’ parity_p is 0.

k=1:

appends is '0' + 0 zeros â†’ '0'.

extended is '011' + '0' â†’ '0110' (length 4). candidate is '0110' â†’ matches b. So returns YES.

Sample 2:

a = '0011'

b = '1110'

For all i and k combinations:

current_s for i=0 is '0011' (parity 2 mod 2 = 0 â†’ appends '0' followed by zeros). Possible k's:

k=0: extended is '0011'. len is 4. required_length 4. candidate is '0011' â†’ not equal.

k=1: appends '0'. extended is '00110'. len 5. m=1. candidate is '0110' â†’ not equal.

k=2: appends '00' â†’ '001100'. m=2 â†’ '1100' â†’ not equal.

...

For other i's:

i=1: current_s is '011'. parity is 2 mod 2=0. appends '0' + 0's.

k=1: '011' + '0' = '0110'. len 4. candidate is '0110' â†’ not equal.

i=2: current_s is '11'. parity is 2 mod 2=0. appends '0' + zeros.

k=2: '11' + '00' â†’ '1100'. len 4. candidate '1100' != '1110'.

Thus, no combination found, output is NO.

Thus, the code works.

Now, let's implement the code.

But note that for current_s being empty (i = len(a)), we need to compute the parity_p as 0.

For example, if a is empty (but the problem says 1 â‰¤ len(a)), but the code should handle current_s being empty.

But according to the problem statement, the initial a has len(a) â‰¥1. But after removes, current_s can be empty. For example, a is '0', i=1 â†’ current_s is empty. Then appends can be done. But the code will compute the parity of current_s (empty) as 0.

But appends can be done on empty strings. Because the operation is allowed.

Thus, the code will correctly handle this case.

Thus, the code is correct.
