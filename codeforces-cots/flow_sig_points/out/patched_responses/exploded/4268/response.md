Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of pairs (i,j) such that when we concatenate s_i and s_j, the resulting string is a lucky ticket. A lucky ticket requires even length, and the sum of the first half equals the sum of the second half.

Hmm. So the concatenated string's length must be even. Then, the sum of the first half digits and the sum of the second half must be equal. So for each possible pair of strings s_i and s_j, we need to check two things: the combined length is even, and the sum of the first half equals the sum of the second half.

But considering the constraints. The number n can be up to 2e5. So a naive approach of checking all pairs (O(n^2)) is impossible. That's way too slow.

So we need a smarter way. Let's think about the possible pairs that can form a lucky ticket. For each possible s_i and s_j, their combined length must be even, which implies that the sum of the lengths of s_i and s_j must be even. So the sum is even only if the two lengths have the same parity. Like, even + even, or odd + odd. Because even + even is even, odd + odd is even. So when s_i's length is even and s_j's length is even, or both are odd.

Wait, right. Because even + even = even, odd + odd = even. So the combined length is even in those cases. So that's the first condition: the sum of lengths must be even. So for a pair (i,j) to be considered, len(s_i) + len(s_j) must be even.

Then, the concatenated string has even length. Let's denote the total length as L. Then, the first half is L/2 digits, and the second half is L/2 digits.

So the concatenated string is s_i followed by s_j. So the first half of the concatenated string is made up of the first (L/2) digits. Similarly for the second half.

The sum of the first half must equal the sum of the second half.

But how can we compute this efficiently?

Let's think about the concatenated string. Suppose s_i has length a, s_j has length b. Then a + b must be even. Let L = a + b. The first half is L/2 digits. So the split is after (L/2) digits. For example, if a is 3 and b is 1, then L=4. Split after 2 digits. So the first two digits are from s_i (since s_i is 3 digits, so the first two digits are the first two of s_i, and the third and fourth are the third of s_i plus all of s_j. Wait, no. Wait, s_i is first, then s_j. So in the concatenated string, the first a digits are s_i, the next b are s_j.

So the first half is the first (L/2) digits, which could span both s_i and s_j. So for example, if s_i is of length 3 and s_j is length 1, the concatenated string is 4 digits. The first two digits are the first two of s_i, the next two are the third of s_i plus s_j. So the sum of the first half (digits 1 and 2) and the sum of the second half (digits 3 and 4).

But how to compute this sum efficiently for all possible pairs?

Wait, but for each possible pair (i,j), the way the split occurs depends on their combined length. For example, if the combined length is 2k, then the first k digits are the first k digits of s_i + s_j. So for example, if s_i has length m and s_j has length n, then the first part of the concatenated string (first k digits) could be part of s_i, all of s_i and part of s_j, or even all of s_i and some of s_j, depending on how k compares to m.

But this seems complicated. For each possible pair, we need to compute how much of s_i and s_j contribute to the first half and the second half. Then compute the sum for each part.

But with n up to 2e5, we need O(n) or O(n * something small) approach. So how can we model this?

Alternative approach: For each possible string s, precompute some information that allows us to pair it with another string t such that their concatenation meets the conditions.

Let's think about the combined string. Let's say the total length is L = a + b (a is len(s_i), b len(s_j)), which must be even. Then the split is after L/2 digits. Let's split into two parts: first part is the first L/2 digits, second part is the remaining L/2 digits.

The sum of the first part's digits must equal the sum of the second part's digits.

So for a given pair (s_i, s_j), the sum of the first half is the sum of the first (L/2) digits of s_i concatenated with s_j. The sum of the second half is the sum of the remaining digits.

Let me split into cases based on whether the split occurs entirely within s_i, or across s_i and s_j, or entirely within s_j.

Wait, for example:

Case 1: a >= L/2. So s_i's length is >= L/2. Then the first half is entirely in s_i. The sum of the first half is the sum of the first L/2 digits of s_i. The second half is the remaining (a - L/2) digits of s_i plus all digits of s_j. Then the sum of the second half is sum of (a - L/2) digits from s_i plus sum of all digits in s_j.

Case 2: a < L/2. Then the first half consists of all of s_i plus the first (L/2 - a) digits of s_j. The sum is sum of s_i's digits plus sum of the first (L/2 - a) digits of s_j. The second half is the remaining digits of s_j (b - (L/2 - a)) digits, which is (b - (L/2 - a)) = (a + b)/2 - a) + ...? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of L = a + b.

Wait, L is a + b. So L/2 is (a + b)/2. So split point is at (a + b)/2 digits.

If a >= split point (split point <= a), then the first split is entirely in s_i, and the second split is the remaining (a - split point) digits of s_i plus all of s_j.

If a < split point, then the first split is all of s_i plus (split point - a) digits of s_j. The second split is the remaining (split point - a) digits of s_j (since split point is (a + b)/2, then the remaining is (a + b)/2 - (split point - a) = (a + b)/2 - split point + a = a + (b - split point + a) ? Hmm, maybe this is getting complicated.

But how can we model this for each possible pair (i,j) efficiently?

Alternative idea: For each possible string s, precompute all possible possible split positions that would be relevant when paired with another string.

Wait, but even that might be tricky. Let's think about the possible split for the concatenated string.

Let me formalize the problem.

Suppose s_i has length a, s_j has length b. The total length is a + b. For this to be even, a + b must be even. Then, the split is at (a + b)/2 digits.

The sum of the first split part is sum_first, and the sum of the second part is sum_second. We need sum_first == sum_second.

But how to compute sum_first and sum_second for all possible pairs (i,j)?

An alternative approach is to categorize each string s into a certain key, such that when paired with another string t, the keys can be used to determine if their concatenation is a lucky ticket.

Let's think for each string s of length a, when it is combined with a string t of length b (such that a + b is even), then the split is at (a + b)/2 digits.

Let me consider each possible a and b, and find for each possible a, b, the conditions on s and t such that sum_first == sum_second.

Case 1: a >= (a + b)/2. Then (a + b)/2 <= a → a >= b. Then split is at k = (a + b)/2 digits. Since a >= k, the first half is the first k digits of s. The second half is the remaining (a - k) digits of s plus all of t.

So sum_first is sum of first k digits of s.

sum_second is sum of (a - k) digits of s (from k+1 to a) + sum of all digits of t.

For sum_first == sum_second, sum of first k digits of s must equal sum of (a -k) digits of s + sum of t's digits.

Rearranged: sum of first k digits of s - sum of (a - k) digits of s = sum of t's digits.

But a -k is (a - (a + b)/2) = (a - b)/2. Since a + b is even, a and b have the same parity.

Hmm. So when a >= (a + b)/2, which implies that a >= b (since (a + b) must be even, so a and b have same parity. So if a >= (a + b)/2 → a >= b. Because (a + b)/2 is (average), so if a >= average, then a >= b).

So for this case, the sum_condition is sum_first_part (first k digits of s) = sum_second_part (sum of s's digits from k+1 to a, plus sum of t's digits).

But how can we model this for each possible s and t?

Alternatively, let's think about for each string s, precompute for all possible possible values of k (split points) when combined with some t. Then, for each possible k, track the required sum that t must have.

But this seems complicated. Let's see.

Alternatively, for each possible split when combining two strings, the total split k = (a + b)/2. For each possible pair (a, b) where a + b is even, the split k is fixed, and the sum_first and sum_second can be broken down into parts from s and t.

But how can we model this?

Alternative approach: For each string s of length a, precompute for all possible possible values of possible split points k that could be required when s is combined with a string t of length b such that a + b is even.

But that's still a bit vague. Let's think about possible a and b pairs:

Suppose s has length a, t has length b. The split is at k = (a + b)/2.

The split can be in s (if a >= k) or across s and t (if a < k).

So for each s, and for each possible possible split scenario (based on the length of t's possible b), precompute the required sum for t's sum and t's length.

But how to group this.

Alternative idea: For each possible combination of a and b where a + b is even, we can model the required sum conditions.

For each possible a (length of s_i) and b (length of s_j), and a + b is even.

Then, for a pair (i,j) with len(s_i) = a, len(s_j) = b, and a + b even, the concatenated string's split is at (a + b)/2.

So for each possible (a, b) pair where a + b is even, we can precompute the way to split the two strings.

Then, for each string s_i of length a, and each possible b where a + b is even, compute the required sum for s_j of length b.

Let me see:

For each (a, b) pair where a + b is even:

Case 1: a >= (a + b)/2 → a >= b (since (a + b)/2 ≤ a → a ≥ b). Then split is at (a + b)/2 digits into s_i.

sum_first is sum of the first (a + b)/2 digits of s_i.

sum_second is sum of the remaining (a - (a + b)/2) digits of s_i + sum of all digits of s_j.

So for this case, sum_second = sum(s_i's digits) - sum_first + sum(s_j's digits).

sum_first must equal sum_second.

So sum_first = sum(s_i) - sum_first + sum(s_j).

Rearranged: 2 * sum_first = sum(s_i) + sum(s_j).

So sum(s_j) = 2 * sum_first - sum(s_i).

So for the pair (i,j) to satisfy this condition, given that a >= b and a + b is even, sum(s_j) must equal 2*sum_first_part_i - sum_i.

sum_first_part_i is the sum of the first (a + b)/2 digits of s_i.

But sum_first_part_i depends on (a + b)/2, which is equal to (a + b)/2. But since a and b are fixed for this case (a and b are the lengths of s_i and s_j), but when considering all possible pairs (i,j) of lengths a and b, the required sum for s_j is determined by sum_first_part_i (which is a function of a and b and s_i's digits).

But how can we precompute this for all possible a and b?

Alternatively, for each possible a, and for each possible possible split k (which depends on the possible b's such that a + b is even and a >= b → (a + b)/2 = k → b = 2k - a. But since b must be >=0, 2k - a >=0 → k >= a/2. Since a + b must be even, and a and b must be compatible.

This seems complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternative approach: Precompute for each string s all possible possible contributions to the count when paired with another string t. For this, for each possible split scenario when combining s with t, precompute the required sum and length, then use a frequency map to count compatible pairs.

Let's model this as follows:

For each string s, and for each possible possible split when combined with t (of length b) such that a + b is even, determine what sum and length conditions t must satisfy, then group these into keys and count how many times each key occurs.

So for each string s (of length a), we can compute all possible possible pairs (b, required_sum) where when combined with a string t of length b and sum t_sum, the pair (b, t_sum) would satisfy the lucky ticket condition.

Then, for each such (b, required_sum), the number of t's in the input that have length b and sum t_sum equals required_sum would contribute to the total count.

So the plan is:

1. Preprocess all strings into a frequency map, where for each (length, sum), we count how many times that (length, sum) pair occurs. Let's call this freq[(length, sum)] = count.

2. For each string s in the input:

   a. For all possible possible ways that s can be part of a pair (as s_i or s_j) that forms a lucky ticket, compute the required (length, sum) pairs that the other string must have.

   b. For each such required (length, sum), add the frequency count from the freq map to the total.

But wait, since the pair is (i,j), and for each i, we need to find j's such that their combination meets the condition. So for each s_i, we compute all possible (b, required_sum) that j's must have, then look up in the freq map how many j's exist with that (b, required_sum) and add to the total.

But since each pair (i,j) is considered once for i and once for j (unless we loop through all possible i and j), but this approach would count all possible pairs correctly, including when i = j.

Wait, no. For example, when considering s_i, and for each possible required (b, sum) that j's must have, the code would look up how many j's (including s_i itself) have that (b, sum). So if s_i's own (b, sum) matches, then i and i will be counted. So this approach correctly accounts for (i,i) pairs.

But how?

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose s_i has length a and sum s_sum. When processing s_i, we compute for all possible possible (b, required_sum) that, when combined with s_i, forms a lucky ticket. Then, for each such (b, required_sum), we add freq[b][required_sum] to the total. But if s_i's own (a, required_sum) is one of the possibilities, then when processing s_i, the count will include j = i if the (a, required_sum) is in the required pairs. But when processing j = i, the same would happen again. Wait, but this would count (i,i) once when processing i. Because the loop is over all i, and for each i, process all j that can pair with it (including i itself). So the total would count each (i,j) once, regardless of whether i and j are the same.

But in this approach, when considering s_i, we look for all j (including i) that can pair with s_i to form a lucky ticket. So each (i,j) is considered once, when i is processed. But j can be any index, including j = i. So the total count would be the sum over all i of the number of j's that can pair with i.

Yes. Because for each i, we find all j's that pair with i (as j can be any index, including i). So this approach will count all pairs (i,j) once. So the total sum is correct.

So the key is to compute for each string s_i, all possible (b, required_sum) pairs that a string s_j must have in order for (s_i + s_j) to be a lucky ticket. Then, the total is the sum for all s_i of the number of s_j's that have (b, required_sum).

So the problem reduces to, for each s_i, determine all possible (b, required_sum) that s_j must have, and accumulate the frequency counts.

Now, the main task is, for each s_i, compute all possible (b, required_sum) pairs.

So how do we compute these (b, required_sum) pairs for a given s_i of length a and sum s_sum?

We can split this into two cases:

Case 1: a and b have the same parity (so a + b is even). So possible b's are those with length such that a + b is even. Then, for each possible b (even or odd, depending on a), compute the required sum for s_j's sum (sum_t) based on the split.

Let me consider all possible possible pairs (a, b) where a + b is even. For each such pair, compute how the concatenated string's sum_first and sum_second are determined by s_i and s_j.

For each (a, b) pair where a + b is even:

Compute k = (a + b) / 2. This is the split point.

The first k digits are the first k digits of s_i concatenated with s_j. So:

If k <= a: the first k digits are all from s_i. The sum_first is sum of first k digits of s_i. sum_second is sum of (a - k) digits of s_i (from k+1 to a) plus sum of s_j's digits.

So sum_second = (s_sum_i - sum_first) + sum_t.

For sum_first == sum_second: sum_first = (s_sum_i - sum_first) + sum_t → sum_t = 2 * sum_first - s_sum_i.

So required_sum_t = 2 * sum_first_part_i - s_sum_i.

But sum_first_part_i is the sum of the first k digits of s_i. k is (a + b)/2. But b is the length of s_j. So for each possible b, the value of k is determined. But how do we find sum_first_part_i?

Alternatively, for a given a and possible b (such that a + b is even), k is (a + b)/2. But for k <= a (since b can be up to ... well, if a + b is even, and a >= b, then k is (a + b)/2. For example, a=5, b=3 → k=4. Then, k <= a (5 >=4). So sum_first_part_i is sum of first 4 digits of s_i.

But how can we precompute all possible sum_first_part_i for all possible k (i.e., all possible b that a + b is even and k <= a)?

But the problem is that for each possible b, the required k is (a + b)/2, which depends on b. So for a given a and b, k is fixed, but for each possible b (with a + b even), the sum_first_part_i is the sum of the first k digits of s_i.

But how to model this?

But the sum of the first k digits of s_i depends on k, which in turn depends on the length of s_j (b). So for each possible b (with a + b even), we can compute k = (a + b)/2, and then check if k <= a (i.e., b <= a). If so, then the sum_first_part_i is the sum of the first k digits of s_i, and required_sum_t is 2 * sum_first_part_i - s_sum_i.

But when k > a, then the first k digits consist of all a digits of s_i plus the first (k -a) digits of s_j. sum_first_part is sum_i + sum of first (k -a) digits of s_j. sum_second_part is sum of the remaining (b - (k -a)) digits of s_j. So sum_first_part == sum_second_part → sum_i + sum_t_first_part = sum_t_second_part. But this would require sum_t_first_part (first (k -a) digits of s_j) and sum_t_second_part (remaining digits of s_j). But how can we model this when the split involves parts of s_j?

In this case, sum_first_part depends on the sum of part of s_j. But the sum of part of s_j's digits is not known from the sum of s_j. So this seems impossible to model with the frequency map, which only tracks the sum of all digits in s_j and its length.

Therefore, this case (k > a) is problematic because the sum of the first part depends on a portion of s_j's digits, which we don't have in the frequency map. Hence, we cannot precompute for s_j the required sum for this case.

So, how to handle this?

Ah, perhaps in this case, the split occurs in s_j. So for the sum_first_part, part of s_j's digits contribute to the sum. But since we don't have information about the sum of parts of s_j, only their total sum, we can't model this.

This seems like a problem. So perhaps the only way to handle this case is if the split occurs entirely within s_i or within s_j.

Wait, wait. Let's think again.

Case 1: split occurs entirely in s_i (k <= a).

Case 2: split occurs entirely in s_j (k >= a + b - ... no. Wait, the split is at (a + b)/2. So if s_i's length a is less than k, then the split starts in s_i and ends in s_j. So the first k digits are all of s_i plus part of s_j. The sum_first_part is sum_i + sum of first (k - a) digits of s_j. The sum_second_part is sum of the remaining (b - (k -a)) digits of s_j.

But sum_second_part is sum_tj - sum_first_part_sj (sum of first (k -a) digits of s_j).

So sum_first_part = sum_i + sum_first_part_sj.

sum_second_part = sum_tj - sum_first_part_sj.

For these to be equal: sum_i + sum_first_part_sj = sum_tj - sum_first_part_sj.

Rearranged: 2 * sum_first_part_sj = sum_tj - sum_i.

But sum_tj is the total sum of s_j. But sum_first_part_sj is the sum of the first (k - a) digits of s_j. However, we don't have this information in the frequency map. The frequency map only knows the total sum of s_j's digits and its length.

Therefore, this case cannot be modeled using the frequency map, because sum_first_part_sj depends on the specific digits of s_j, not just their total sum and length.

Therefore, this case is not manageable with the frequency map approach. So, perhaps the only possible pairs (i,j) that can be counted are those where the split occurs entirely within s_i or entirely within s_j.

Wait, but when the split occurs entirely within s_j, what does that mean?

For example, s_i has length a, s_j has length b. Split is at (a + b)/2. Suppose a + b is even, and (a + b)/2 > a. So the split is into s_i's a digits and (k - a) digits of s_j. Then sum_first_part = sum_i + sum of first (k -a) digits of s_j. Sum_second_part is sum of the remaining digits of s_j (sum_tj - sum_first_part_sj).

But sum_first_part_sj is sum of first (k -a) digits of s_j, which isn't stored. So how can we model this?

We can't. So, perhaps the only feasible cases to model with the frequency map are those where the split occurs entirely within s_i or entirely within s_j.

Wait, when does the split occur entirely within s_j?

That would mean that the split is after a + b / 2 digits, but s_i's entire length a is less than (a + b)/2, and the split is such that the entire s_i is part of the first half, and part of s_j is part of the first half, and the remaining part of s_j is the second half.

But again, this requires knowing part of s_j's digits, which we don't have.

So perhaps the only way to proceed is to handle the cases where the split is entirely within s_i or entirely within s_j.

Wait, for split to be entirely within s_j, the split must start after s_i. So the first (a + b)/2 digits must include all of s_i and part of s_j. So split is entirely within s_j if (a + b)/2 >= a, which implies that b >= a. So for example, s_i's length is 3, s_j's length is 5. a + b = 8, split at 4 digits. So first 4 digits are s_i (3) plus first 1 digit of s_j. The split is across s_i and s_j. So we can't model this.

Alternatively, for the split to be entirely within s_j, the split must be after a + b /2 digits, but all of those digits are in s_j. So s_i's entire length is zero. But that's not possible. So the split can't be entirely within s_j unless s_i is empty, which it's not.

Therefore, the only feasible case is when the split is entirely within s_i. Which requires that the split point k = (a + b)/2 <= a. So this happens when b <= a. Because k = (a +b)/2 <= a → a +b <= 2a → b <=a.

So for the case where b <= a and a +b is even (so same parity), the split is entirely within s_i, and the required_sum_t is 2*sum_first_part_i - sum_i.

But when b > a and a + b is even, the split is across s_i and s_j, and the sum depends on parts of s_j's digits. Which we cannot model with the frequency map.

So in this case, the only way to handle these pairs is to ignore them, but that would miss some valid pairs.

But this is a problem. So how can we proceed?

Alternatively, perhaps the only way to model this is to precompute all possible possible combinations where the split occurs within s_i. Then, for the other cases where the split is across s_i and s_j, we can't model them and thus those pairs are not counted.

But that would miss some pairs and lead to incorrect results.

So this suggests that the frequency map approach can only count pairs where the split occurs entirely within s_i (i.e., when b <= a and a +b is even). But how about the other case where the split is across s_i and s_j?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can model both cases where the split is within s_i or within s_j.

Wait, when the split is within s_j, that would require that the first part is entirely s_i and some of s_j, and the second part is the remaining s_j.

But sum_first_part is sum_i + sum_part_of_sj. sum_second_part is sum_remaining_sj.

For sum_first_part == sum_second_part:

sum_i + sum_part_of_sj = sum_remaining_sj.

sum_part_of_sj + sum_remaining_sj = sum_tj → sum_remaining_sj = sum_tj - sum_part_of_sj.

So substituting:

sum_i + sum_part_of_sj = sum_tj - sum_part_of_sj.

sum_i = sum_tj - 2 * sum_part_of_sj.

But this depends on sum_part_of_sj, which is part of s_j's digits. Since we don't track this in the frequency map, this is impossible to model.

Therefore, the only way to model these cases is to precompute all possible possible split positions within each s_j and store information about their partial sums.

But that's computationally expensive. For example, for each s_j of length m, we can precompute the sum of the first k digits for all possible k (from 1 to m). But for m up to 5 (since the input strings are of length up to 5), this is manageable.

Ah, wait! The problem states that each input string is up to 5 digits long. So for each string s_j of length m (up to 5), we can precompute the prefix sums for all possible k (up to 5). Then, when processing a string s_i, for the case where the split is across s_i and s_j, we can look for s_j's that have certain prefix sums.

So here's the revised plan:

We can model both cases where the split is within s_i or within s_j. For the split within s_i case, we can use the frequency map of (length, sum). For the split within s_j case, we need to look for s_j's of certain lengths and with certain prefix sums.

But for each s_j, we can precompute all possible prefix sums for all possible k (since the length is up to 5, the number of possible prefix sums is manageable).

So let's split the problem into two parts:

1. Case 1: split is within s_i (k <= a). So for each s_i of length a, and possible b such that a + b is even and b <= a (so k = (a + b)/2 <= a), we compute required_sum_t = 2 * sum_first_part_i - sum_i. We can use the frequency map to count the number of s_j's with length b and sum required_sum_t.

2. Case 2: split is within s_j. That is, the split occurs such that all of s_i and some part of s_j are in the first half, and the remaining part of s_j is in the second half. So k = (a + b)/2 must be >= a (since split is after s_i's end plus some part of s_j). So k >=a → a + b >= 2a → b >=a. Also, a + b must be even.

In this case, the required condition is sum_i + sum_first_part_sj = sum_second_part_sj.

sum_second_part_sj = sum_sj - sum_first_part_sj.

So sum_i + sum_first_part_sj = sum_sj - sum_first_part_sj → sum_i = sum_sj - 2 * sum_first_part_sj → sum_sj - 2 * sum_first_part_sj = sum_i.

So for this case, the required condition is sum_sj - 2 * sum_first_part_sj = sum_i. And the length of s_j must be b >= a, and a + b is even.

But sum_first_part_sj is the sum of the first (k -a) digits of s_j. Since k = (a + b)/2, and k -a = (b -a)/2. Because:

k = (a + b)/2 → k -a = (a + b)/2 -a = (b -a)/2.

So for this case, the sum of the first (b -a)/2 digits of s_j must be (sum_sj - sum_i)/2. Also, sum_sj - sum_i must be even, since (sum_sj - sum_i) must be divisible by 2.

But since a and b are such that a + b is even and b >=a, then b -a is even (since a +b is even → (b -a) = even). So (b -a)/2 is an integer.

So for this case, the required (b, sum_sj, sum_first_part) must satisfy sum_sj - 2*sum_first_part = sum_i.

But to model this, for each s_j, we can precompute for all possible possible values of (b, (b -a)/2, sum_first_part) where b >= a, a + b even, and sum_first_part is the sum of the first (b -a)/2 digits of s_j.

But how can we efficiently compute this for all possible a and b?

Alternatively, for each s_j of length m, precompute for all possible possible possible split positions l (the number of digits taken from s_j for the first part in case 2). Then, for case 2, the required sum for s_i is sum_sj - 2 * sum_first_part_sj, and the length a of s_i must be such that a + m is even and a <= m. Also, a must be equal to m - 2l, since:

We have l = (b -a)/2 → a = b - 2l. But b is the length of s_j (m). So a = m - 2l. And since a must be >=0, l can be up to m/2.

Wait, no. In case 2, a is the length of s_i. So for a given s_j of length m, possible a's are those where a + m is even (since a + b is even, where b is m). So a must have the same parity as m. Also, a must be <= m (since in case 2, split is after s_i's length and part of s_j). So a can be any value such that a <= m, a + m is even, and a is the length of s_i.

But l is the number of digits taken from s_j for the first part. So l = (m - a)/2.

Wait, because a + m is even → m -a is even. So (m - a)/2 is an integer.

But l is the number of digits from s_j taken into the first part. So l = (k - a), where k = (a + m)/2 (since a + b is m). So k = (a + m)/2 → k -a = (m -a)/2 → l = (m -a)/2.

So l must be >= 0, which implies m >= a. Which is the condition for case 2.

But for a given s_j of length m, the possible a's are those lengths where a <= m and a + m is even. So for each such a, we can compute l = (m - a)/2. Then, for s_j, if it has a prefix sum of l digits equal to sum_prefix, then the required sum_i is sum_sj - 2 * sum_prefix.

But how can we model this in code?

The approach would be:

For each s_j of length m:

   For all possible l in 0 to m:

      if l is such that (m - a) = 2l → a = m - 2l. But a must be >=0, so m - 2l >=0 → l <= m/2.

      But l is (m -a)/2. So possible a's are m - 2l, where l is 0 <= l <= m/2.

      For each possible l (from 0 to m//2), compute the sum of the first l digits of s_j (sum_prefix).

      Then, the required sum_i is sum_sj - 2 * sum_prefix.

      Also, a must be m - 2l, which must be >=0, and a + m is even (since a = m - 2l → a + m = 2m -2l = 2(m -l), which is even. So a + m is even automatically.

      Also, a is the length of s_i. So for each possible l in s_j, we can compute a = m - 2l, and required_sum_i = sum_sj - 2 * sum_prefix.

      Then, for all s_i of length a, if their sum is required_sum_i, then they contribute to the count.

So for case 2, the approach is:

For each s_j, precompute for all possible l (prefix lengths of s_j) up to m//2, compute a = m - 2l and required_sum_i = sum_sj - 2 * sum_prefix. Then, for each such (a, required_sum_i), we look up how many s_i's exist with length a and sum required_sum_i. Add this to the total count.

So combining both cases:

The total count is the sum over all pairs (i,j) that satisfy either case 1 or case 2.

But how to implement this efficiently.

So the steps are:

1. Preprocess all strings into two data structures:

   a. freq: a dictionary mapping (length, sum) to the number of occurrences. This is for case 1.

   b. for case 2, for each s_j of length m and sum sum_j, precompute all possible l (from 0 to m//2) and compute a = m - 2l and required_sum_i = sum_j - 2 * sum_prefix_j_l, where sum_prefix_j_l is the sum of the first l digits of s_j. Then, for each (a, required_sum_i), track how many times this occurs. But this is more complex.

But how to model case 2. For case 2, for each s_j, we generate for all possible l in 0 to floor(m/2), the a and required_sum_i. Then, for each such (a, required_sum_i), we can look up the number of s_i's with length a and sum required_sum_i. Summing over all s_j's and all possible l for each s_j.

But to do this, we need to precompute for each s_j all possible l (up to m//2) and their sum_prefix_j_l. Then, for each such l, compute a = m - 2l and required_sum_i = sum_j - 2 * sum_prefix_j_l.

Then, for each s_j, and each l, the contribution to the total is the count of s_i's with length a and sum required_sum_i.

So for case 2, the code would look like:

for each s_j in input:

    m = len(s_j)

    sum_j = sum of its digits

    for l in 0 to m//2:

        a = m - 2*l

        if a <0:

            continue

        sum_prefix = sum of first l digits of s_j

        required_sum_i = sum_j - 2 * sum_prefix

        total += freq.get( (a, required_sum_i), 0 )

But wait, this is per s_j, and for each possible l. Since the maximum m is 5, the loop for l is up to 2 steps (since for m=5, m//2=2). So for each s_j, the loop runs at most 3 times (l=0,1,2). This is manageable.

So the code for case 2 is to, for each s_j, loop over all possible l (0 to m//2), compute a and required_sum_i, and add the frequency count of (a, required_sum_i) to the total.

This way, each pair (i,j) where the split is in case 2 (split across s_i and s_j) is counted when processing s_j. Because for case 2, the split is in s_j's part, and thus the required_sum_i is determined by s_j's sum and its prefix sum.

So combining case 1 and case 2, the total count is:

total = case1_count + case2_count.

But we need to make sure that we are not double-counting any pairs. For example, a pair (i,j) may satisfy both case1 and case2 conditions. Is this possible?

For example, suppose s_i is length 2, sum 5. s_j is length 2, sum 5. Then, their concatenation is length 4, split after 2 digits. So case1 applies (split is within s_i), and case2 would be when processing s_j with l=0. Because for s_j of length 2, m=2. l can be 0 or 1. For l=0: a=2-0=2. required_sum_i = 5 - 0 =5. So s_i's sum is 5 and length 2, so when processing s_j, case2 would count s_i as a possible partner. So case1 and case2 may count the same pair (i,j) once each. Which is incorrect.

Wait, no. Because in case1, when we process s_i, we compute for all possible b (lengths) where a +b is even and b <=a. For example, when s_i is length 2, and s_j is length 2 (b=2), a +b=4, even. So case1 applies. Then, the code for case1 would count this pair when processing s_i. And case2 would process s_j and find a=2 (m=2, l=0: a=2-0=2) and required_sum_i=5-0=5. So if s_i has sum 5 and length 2, then when processing s_j, case2 would add 1 (assuming s_i is present). So this pair would be counted once in case1 and once in case2, leading to double-counting.

But that's a problem. So we need to find a way to avoid this.

But why is this happening? Because the same pair (i,j) can be counted in both case1 and case2.

For example, when s_i and s_j are of the same length (even), then their concatenated length is even. The split is in the middle. For case1, when processing s_i, the split is in s_i (since a=2 and b=2: (a +b)/2=2, which is equal to a. So the split is after the entire s_i. Then sum_first_part is sum of s_i's digits, sum_second_part is sum of s_j's digits. So for sum_first_part == sum_second_part, sum_i must equal sum_j. So this is case1.

But in case2, when processing s_j, the code checks l=0. a = 2-0*2=2, required_sum_i = sum_j - 2*0 (sum of first 0 digits of s_j is 0) → required_sum_i = sum_j. So if s_i has sum_j and length 2, this pair is also counted in case2.

Thus, the same pair (i,j) would be counted twice: once in case1 (when processing i) and once in case2 (when processing j).

So this is a problem. The code would count pairs twice in such scenarios.

Therefore, we need to find a way to avoid this double-counting.

But how?

Let me think: the cases are mutually exclusive? Or are they overlapping?

In the example above, when s_i and s_j are the same length (a = b), then the split is at a +b /2 = a digits. So case1 applies (split within s_i) and case2 applies (split within s_j). Because when processing s_j, the l is (m -a)/2. Here, m is b (the length of s_j), and a is the length of s_i. But in case2, a is m - 2l. If s_j's length is 2, and l=0, then a=2-0*2=2, and required_sum_i = sum_j - 0. So in this case, when processing s_j, we are looking for s_i's of length 2 and sum equal to sum_j. Which is the same as the case1 condition.

Thus, for pairs (i,j) where a = b and sum_i = sum_j, they are counted twice: once in case1 and once in case2.

So the code would count them twice, leading to an overcount.

But the correct count is one for such pairs (i,j). Because each pair (i,j) should be counted once, regardless of how the split is handled.

So we need to find a way to avoid this double-counting.

But how?

The problem arises because when a = b and sum_i = sum_j, the pair (i,j) can be counted in both cases.

To resolve this, perhaps we can split the cases into:

- case1: split is within s_i (b <=a and a +b even)

- case2: split is within s_j (a <b and a +b even)

In this way, the two cases are mutually exclusive. Because for a pair (i,j) where a = b, case1 applies (since b =a <=a) and case2 does not. So there is no overlap.

But wait, case2 is when the split is within s_j. For a pair (i,j) with a =b, the split is after (a +b)/2 = a digits. So split is within s_i (case1) and not within s_j. So case2 doesn't apply. So for (i,j) with a =b, only case1 is applicable.

But wait, the previous example where s_i and s_j have the same length, a =b =2, then the split is after 2 digits. The split is within s_i (all digits of s_i are part of the first half), and s_j's digits are part of the second half. So case1 applies. When processing s_j in case2, the code would look for a =m -2l. For l=0, a=2, but then in case2, the code would be for splits where a < m, but m is 2, a=2. So a < m is not true. So the code for case2 would not process this case.

Wait, no. When processing s_j in case2, the code loops over l from 0 to m//2. For m=2, m//2 is 1. So l can be 0 or 1.

For l=0: a= m - 2*l = 2 -0=2. So a=2. Then, required_sum_i is sum_j - 2 * sum_prefix (sum of first 0 digits, which is 0). required_sum_i = sum_j. For case2, the code is counting pairs where a =2 and sum_i = sum_j. But in case1, when processing s_i (of length 2 and sum_i), the code is looking for s_j of length 2 and sum_j = sum_i. So case1 and case2 would both count the same pairs when a=2 and sum_i = sum_j.

But in case2, the code is processing s_j, and looking for s_i of length a=2 and sum_i=sum_j. But for a pair (i,j) where a=2 and sum_i=sum_j, when processing s_j in case2, a=2 is computed as m - 2*l (m=2, l=0). But in case2, the split is within s_j (k >= a). But in this case, a=2 and m=2. So k = (2 + 2)/2 =2. So the split is at 2 digits, which is the same as case1. So this case is being counted in both case1 and case2.

So to avoid double-counting, perhaps case2 should be split into cases where a < m, not a <= m. Because when a =m, then split is in case1 (split within s_i).

So the code for case2 should only process l such that a <m. Because when a =m, then a is not less than m. So for l=0, a= m -0= m. So a <m is false. So in this case, the code for case2 would not process it.

Wait, for l=0 and m=2: a = 2-0=2. So a is not less than m. So the code for case2 would not process this.

But how? Let's look at the code for case2:

for each s_j of length m:

    for l in 0 to m//2:

        a = m - 2*l

        if a <0:

            continue

        required_sum_i = sum_j - 2 * sum_prefix_j_l

        total += freq.get( (a, required_sum_i), 0 )

But in this case, when a =m (since m =2, a=2), and a is not less than m, then this code would still process it. So the code for case2 counts pairs where a =m and sum_i = sum_j.

But these pairs are already being counted in case1. So this leads to double-counting.

Therefore, the code for case2 should only process cases where a <m, i.e., where the split is within s_j and s_i's length is less than s_j's length.

So to prevent this, in case2, we should only consider l where a = m -2l <m. Which implies that m -2l <m → 2l>0 → l>0.

So for l >=1.

But in code, the code for case2 currently loops over l in 0 to m//2. So for l=0, a =m. Then, a >=m (since a =m). So in case2, the code would count pairs where a =m, which is the same as case1.

Thus, the code for case2 should skip l=0 (and other l's that lead to a >=m).

So to fix this, in case2, we should only process l where a = m -2l <m → 2l >0 → l >=1.

So modifying the code for case2:

for each s_j in input:

    m = len(s_j)

    sum_j = sum of its digits

    for l in 1 to m//2:

        a = m - 2*l

        if a <0:

            continue

        sum_prefix = sum of first l digits of s_j

        required_sum_i = sum_j - 2 * sum_prefix

        total += freq.get( (a, required_sum_i), 0 )

So in this way, case2 only processes l >=1, which leads to a <m.

Thus, the two cases are mutually exclusive:

- case1: b <=a and a +b even. So when processing s_i, we look for s_j of length b <=a.

- case2: a <b (since a = m -2l, m is the length of s_j, and l >=1 → a = m -2*1 = m-2. So if m is 5, a=3. So a <m.

Thus, case1 and case2 are mutually exclusive.

Therefore, there's no overlap, and the code will not double-count pairs.

So the revised plan is:

case1: split is within s_i. So b <=a and a +b even. For each s_i of length a, and for all possible b <=a with a +b even, compute required_sum_t = 2 * sum_first_part_i - sum_i. Sum the frequencies of (b, required_sum_t).

case2: split is within s_j. So a <b and a +b even. For each s_j of length m, and for all possible l >=1 up to m//2, compute a = m -2*l. If a >=0, compute required_sum_i = sum_j - 2*sum_prefix_j_l. Sum the frequencies of (a, required_sum_i).

Thus, the code can be structured as follows:

1. Precompute the frequency map: count the number of strings for each (length, sum) pair.

2. For case1:

   For each s_i in input:

       a = len(s_i)

       sum_i = sum of digits of s_i

       for b in all even and odd lengths such that b <=a and (a + b) is even:

           k = (a + b) // 2

           sum_first_part_i = sum of first k digits of s_i

           required_sum_t = 2 * sum_first_part_i - sum_i

           add freq.get( (b, required_sum_t), 0 ) to the total.

3. For case2:

   For each s_j in input:

       m = len(s_j)

       sum_j = sum of digits of s_j

       for l in 1 to m//2:

           a = m - 2*l

           if a <0:

               continue

           sum_prefix_j_l = sum of first l digits of s_j

           required_sum_i = sum_j - 2 * sum_prefix_j_l

           add freq.get( (a, required_sum_i), 0 ) to the total.

Now, the main challenge is to efficiently compute the sum_first_part_i for case1 for all possible b's.

But for case1, b can range from 1 to a, but only those b's where a +b is even. So for each a, the possible b's are those with the same parity as a (since a +b must be even).

For example, if a is even, then b must be even and <=a.

If a is odd, then b must be odd and <=a.

So for each a, possible b's are even or odd, depending on a's parity.

But for each s_i of length a, and for each possible b (same parity as a, <=a), we need to compute the sum of the first k digits of s_i, where k = (a +b)/2.

But since a +b must be even, k is an integer.

But how many possible b's are there for a given a?

For a given a, the possible b's are all integers of the same parity as a, and <=a.

So for a=5 (odd), possible b's are 1,3,5.

For a=4 (even), possible b's are 0, 2,4 (but strings can't have length 0, so 2 and4).

Wait, but the input strings are non-empty. So b can be from 1 to a.

So for a=4, possible b's are even numbers from 1 to4: 2 and4.

Wait, for a=4 and b=4: a +b =8, even. k=4. sum_first_part_i is sum of first4 digits of s_i (which is the sum of s_i's digits, since a=4). required_sum_t = 2*sum_i - sum_i = sum_i. So s_j must have sum sum_i and length4.

So for case1, for each s_i, we need to iterate over all possible b's (same parity as a, <=a) and compute k = (a +b)/2, then sum the first k digits of s_i.

But the problem is that for each possible b, the k varies, and for each k, we need to compute the sum of the first k digits of s_i.

But how can this be done efficiently?

For example, for a string of length up to 5, the possible k's are up to (5 +5)/2=5 (for a=5, b=5).

So for each string s_i, we can precompute the prefix sums for all possible k's (from 1 to a). For example, for a string "1234", the prefix sums are [1,3,6,10] for k=1,2,3,4.

So for each s_i, we can precompute a list of prefix sums.

Once we have that, for each possible b (same parity as a, <=a), we compute k = (a +b)/2, and then look up the prefix sum up to k.

So the steps for case1 processing are:

For each s_i:

   a = len(s_i)

   sum_i = sum of all digits

   prefix_sums = precomputed list where prefix_sums[k] is sum of first k digits (1-based)

   possible_bs = all values of b in [1..a] with same parity as a.

   for b in possible_bs:

       k = (a + b) // 2

       sum_first_part = prefix_sums[k]

       required_sum_t = 2 * sum_first_part - sum_i

       total += freq.get( (b, required_sum_t), 0 )

Thus, for case1, we can process each s_i efficiently.

But for each s_i, the possible_bs can be generated as follows:

possible_bs = list of integers b where 1 <= b <= a, and (a +b) is even → b has the same parity as a.

So for a even, b can be 2,4,... up to a.

But even for a up to 5, this is manageable. For example:

a=5 (odd): possible b's are 1,3,5.

a=4 (even): possible b's are 2,4.

a=3 (odd): 1,3.

a=2 (even): 2.

a=1 (odd): 1.

So the number of possible_bs for each a is at most (a+1)/2. For a=5, 3 options. For a=4, 2 options. So per s_i, this loop runs 3 times at most.

Thus, this is manageable.

So the code can be structured as:

precompute for each string:

   sum of digits

   prefix sums for all k up to length.

Then, for case1:

for each s_i:

   a = len(s_i)

   sum_i = sum of digits

   prefix_sums = [0]*(a+1)

   for k in 1..a:

       prefix_sums[k] = prefix_sums[k-1] + int(digit)

   possible_bs = [b for b in range(1, a+1) if (a + b) %2 ==0]

   for b in possible_bs:

       k = (a +b) //2

       sum_first = prefix_sums[k]

       required_sum_t = 2 * sum_first - sum_i

       total += freq.get( (b, required_sum_t), 0 )

For case2:

for each s_j:

   m = len(s_j)

   sum_j = sum of digits

   prefix_sums = [0]*(m+1)

   for k in 1..m:

       prefix_sums[k] = prefix_sums[k-1] + int(digit)

   for l in 1 to m//2:

       a = m - 2*l

       if a <0:

           continue

       sum_prefix = prefix_sums[l]

       required_sum_i = sum_j - 2 * sum_prefix

       total += freq.get( (a, required_sum_i), 0 )

So this approach should correctly count all pairs.

Now, let's test this with the examples.

First example:

Input:

10

5 93746 59 3746 593 746 5937 46 59374 6

The output is 20.

But let's see why. For example, pairs (i,j) where the concatenated string is even length and the sum of first half equals the sum of second half.

But with the code, the case1 and case2 counts are summed.

Another example: input 3 '1's.

All three are length 1. For each pair (i,j), concatenated length is 2, which is even.

The sum of first 1 digit and second 1 digit. Since all are '1', sum is 1 and 1. So each pair (i,j) is counted. There are 3*3=9 pairs. Which matches the example.

In this case, for each s_i (length 1, sum 1), the possible_bs for case1 are b's <=1 and same parity as a (1 is odd). So possible b's are 1.

So for case1, for each s_i, processing b=1.

k = (1+1)/2 =1.

sum_first_part = sum of first 1 digits of s_i (which is 1).

required_sum_t = 2*1 -1 =1.

So freq for (1,1) is 3 (since all three are '1's).

So each s_i contributes 3 to case1. So case1 count is 3*3=9.

case2: for each s_j of length 1, l can be up to 0 (m//2=0). So no case2 processing. So total is 9, which matches.

Another example: input 5 strings of varying lengths of 2's.

Input:

5

2 22 222 2222 22222

Output:13.

Let's see.

For each pair (i,j), the concatenated string must be even length and sum of first half equals sum of second half.

For example, when concatenating "2" and "2", the combined string is "22", which is even. Each half is "2" and sum 2. So valid.

Similarly, "2" and "22" forms "222" which is length 3, which is odd. So invalid.

But code must handle all possible pairs.

But according to the code, case1 and case2 are processed.

But the code's output is 13. So the code's approach works.

Now, the code's implementation in Python.

First, we need to precompute the frequency map.

Then, process case1 and case2.

Now, code steps:

Read n.

Read the list of strings.

Precompute for each string its sum, prefix sums, and length.

Build the frequency map: a dictionary where keys are tuples (length, sum), and values are counts.

Then, for case1:

Loop over each string s in the list:

   a = len(s)

   sum_i = sum of digits.

   prefix_sums = precompute [0] + accumulate sum.

   possible_bs: same parity as a, <=a.

   for each b in possible_bs:

       k = (a +b) //2

       sum_first_part = prefix_sums[k]

       required_sum_t = 2 * sum_first_part - sum_i

       add freq.get( (b, required_sum_t), 0 )

Then, case2:

Loop over each string s in the list:

   m = len(s)

   sum_j = sum of digits.

   prefix_sums = precompute [0] + accumulate sum.

   for l in 1 to m//2:

       a = m - 2*l

       if a <0:

           continue

       sum_prefix = prefix_sums[l]

       required_sum_i = sum_j - 2 * sum_prefix

       add freq.get( (a, required_sum_i), 0 )

The total is the sum of case1 and case2.

Now, implement this.

But how to precompute the prefix sums.

For a string s, for example "123", the digits are 1,2,3. The prefix sums would be [0,1,3,6].

So for s in the input, we can precompute the prefix sums as follows:

prefix_sums = [0]

current_sum =0

for c in s:

    current_sum += int(c)

    prefix_sums.append(current_sum)

Thus, prefix_sums[k] is the sum of the first k digits.

Now, code:

Read n.

Read the list of strings.

Compute for each string its length, sum, prefix sums.

Build the frequency map.

Initialize total=0.

Process case1:

for s in strings:

    a = len(s)

    sum_i = sum of digits.

    prefix_sums = list of prefix sums.

    possible_bs = [b for b in range(1, a+1) if (a +b) %2 ==0]

    for b in possible_bs:

        k = (a +b) //2

        sum_first = prefix_sums[k]

        required_sum_t = 2*sum_first - sum_i

        total += freq.get( (b, required_sum_t), 0 )

Process case2:

for s in strings:

    m = len(s)

    sum_j = sum of digits.

    prefix_sums = list of prefix sums.

    max_l = m //2

    for l in range(1, max_l +1):

        a = m - 2*l

        if a <0:

            continue

        sum_prefix = prefix_sums[l]

        required_sum_i = sum_j - 2 * sum_prefix

        total += freq.get( (a, required_sum_i), 0 )

Return total.

But how to build the frequency map.

We can build a defaultdict(int) for the frequency map.

But since the input can be up to 2e5 strings, and each string's length is up to 5, we need to process each string once.

So code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
from collections import defaultdict


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

    strings = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()

    freq = defaultdict(int)

    # precompute for each string its length, sum, prefix sums.

    str_info = []

    for s in strings:

        m = len(s)

        digits = list(map(int, s))

        sum_total = sum(digits)

        prefix_sums = [0]*(m+1)

        for i in range(m):

            prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + digits[i]

        str_info.append( (m, sum_total, prefix_sums) )

        # update frequency map

        freq[(m, sum_total)] +=1

    total =0

    # process case1

    for m, sum_total, prefix_sums in str_info:

        possible_bs = [b for b in range(1, m+1) if (m +b) %2 ==0]

        for b in possible_bs:

            k = (m + b) //2

            sum_first_part = prefix_sums[k]

            required_sum_t = 2 * sum_first_part - sum_total

            # look up freq for (b, required_sum_t)

            total += freq.get( (b, required_sum_t), 0 )

    # process case2

    for m, sum_total, prefix_sums in str_info:

        max_l = m //2

        for l in range(1, max_l +1):

            a = m - 2*l

            if a <0:

                continue

            sum_prefix = prefix_sums[l]

            required_sum_i = sum_total - 2 * sum_prefix

            # look up freq for (a, required_sum_i)

            total += freq.get( (a, required_sum_i), 0 )

    print(total, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
5
2 22 222 2222 22222
""",
            "output": \
"""\
13
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Second example:

5

2 22 222 2222 22222 → output 13.

Third example:

3

1 1 1 → output 9.

Thus, the code should work.

        required = sum_j - 2 * sum_prefix
        total += freq.get((a, required), 0)
