Okay, let's see. The problem is to split students into two classrooms such that the number of chatty pairs is minimized. A chatty pair is two students with the same starting letter in the same classroom. So, for each group (students with same starting letter), we need to decide how to split them between the two classrooms to minimize the sum of their internal pairs.

Hmm. The key here is that for each starting letter, let's say there are c students. We can split them into a and b, where a + b = c. The number of pairs in this group would be (a choose 2) + (b choose 2). Our goal is to choose a and b for each group such that the sum of all these values is minimized.

Wait, right. Because for each group, splitting them into two parts and summing the pairs from each part. So for each group, the minimal possible pairs is when a is as close to c/2 as possible. For example, if a group has 5 students, splitting into 2 and 3 gives (2+3) = 5, and the pairs are 1 + 3 = 4. Which is better than putting all in one classroom (10 pairs). So for each group, the minimal pairs is floor(c/2) * ceil(c/2) / 2? Wait, let me think. Wait, (a choose 2) + (b choose 2) where a + b = c. So to minimize this sum, we want a and b to be as equal as possible. Because the sum is (a² -a + b² - b)/2. Since a + b is fixed (c), the sum a² + b² is minimized when a and b are as close as possible. So yes, for each group, the minimal possible pairs is achieved by splitting as evenly as possible.

So for each group with size k, the minimal contribution is (floor(k/2) choose 2) + (ceil(k/2) choose 2). For example, k=5, floor is 2, ceil 3: 1 +3 =4. For k=4, 2 and 2: 1+1=2.

But wait, what if some groups have multiple splits? Like, if a group can be split into different a and b, but the sum is same. But for the purpose of the problem, the minimal sum is the same as long as a and b are as close as possible.

So the problem reduces to, for each starting letter, compute the minimal possible pairs for that group, sum them all, and that's the answer. But wait, no! Because the way the groups are split might depend on how they are allocated across the two classrooms. Wait, no. Wait, each group is split into two parts (possibly 0 in one part). Each part goes into one of the two classrooms. But since the classrooms are two, the split for each group is a and b = c -a, and the sum for each group is fixed to the minimal possible once a is chosen as floor(c/2) or ceil(c/2). Wait, but the split is per group. Each group's split is independent of the others. Because the group's split (how many go to classroom A vs B) can vary, but the sum depends only on how a and b are chosen for that group. So for each group, the minimal possible contribution is (floor(c/2) choose 2) + (ceil(c/2) choose 2), which is the same as (c² - s) / 2, where s is the split. Wait, maybe not. Let me compute it.

Let me take k as the group size. The minimal possible pairs for that group is (a choose 2) + (b choose 2) where a + b = k and a is as close as possible to b. So for even k, a = b = k/2. Sum is 2 * ( (k/2) * (k/2 -1)/2 ) ) = k(k-2)/4. For example, k=4: 2*( (4/2 choose 2 )) → 2 * (2*1/2) = 2 * 1 → 2. Which is correct.

For odd k, say 5: a=2, b=3. Sum is (2*1/2) + (3*2/2) → 1 +3 =4. Which is (5² -5)/2 - (2*2*3) / 2? Not sure.

But the point is, for each group, the minimal possible pairs is fixed once we split them as evenly as possible. Therefore, the total minimal x is the sum over all groups of (floor(k/2) choose 2) + (ceil(k/2) choose 2).

Wait, but that's only true if each group's split is handled optimally. So the answer is the sum for each starting letter of (a choose 2) + (b choose 2) where a is the floor of k/2 and b is the ceiling. So that's the minimal possible for each group, and since these are additive, the total is the sum of these.

Wait, but the problem allows us to split all students into one classroom. For example, if all students are in one classroom, the sum would be the sum of (k choose 2) for each group. But the minimal possible is when each group is split as optimally as possible. So, perhaps the answer is the sum over all groups of the minimal possible pairs when split as evenly as possible.

But that seems correct, but wait. For example, consider two groups. Let's say group A has 3 students, group B has 3 students. Splitting each into 1 and 2 gives (1+2) for each group, total 2+1=3. But if we could split group A into 3 and 0, and group B into 0 and 3, that would be 3 and 3, sum 6. So the minimal is achieved by splitting each group optimally. So the sum is the sum of the minimal for each group.

But in that case, how is the sample input 2 handled?

Sample input 2 has 7 students, all starting with 'k' except three: heihachi (h), katsushiro (k), kikuchiyo (k). Wait, wait, the input is:

kambei (k), gorobei (g?), shichiroji (s?), kyuzo (k?), heihachi (h), katsushiro (k), kikuchiyo (k).

Wait, perhaps I need to check the actual starting letters. Let's see:

kambei starts with k.

gorobei with g.

shichiroji with s.

kyuzo with k.

heihachi with h.

katsushiro with k.

kikuchiyo with k.

So the groups are:

k: 5 students (kambei, kyuzo, katsushiro, kikuchiyo, and wait, the sample input 2 lists 7 names. Let me recount:

kambei (k)

gorobei (g) → group g: 1

shichiroji (s) → group s:1

kyuzo (k)

heihachi (h) → group h:1

katsushiro (k)

kikuchiyo (k)

So group k has 4 students (kambei, kyuzo, katsushiro, kikuchiyo?), wait, wait:

Wait, the sample input 2 is:

7 students:

kambei → k

gorobei → g

shichiroji → s

kyuzo →k 

heihachi →h 

katsushiro →k 

kikuchiyo →k 

So group k has 4 students (kambei, kyuzo, katsushiro, kikuchiyo → 4). So for group k, split into 2 and 2, each contributing 1 pair. So total for group k is 1+1=2. The other groups (g, s, h) have 1 each. So when split as per minimal, each of these groups (size 1) would be split into 1 and 0, contributing 0 pairs (since (1 choose 2) is zero and (0 choose 2) is zero). So total sum is 2 (from k) + 0 (g) + 0 (s) +0 (h) → 2. Which matches the sample output. So the answer is indeed sum of the minimal possible per group.

Wait, but in the sample explanation, the split resulted in two pairs. How does that fit?

In the sample explanation, the first group (kambei, gorobei, shichiroji, kyuzo) → but that's group k (kambei, kyuzo, katsushiro, kikuchiyo) split into 4 in one classroom. Wait, no, perhaps the sample explanation splits the group k into two parts. Wait, perhaps in the sample explanation, group k has 4 students. So when split into 2 and 2, each contributes 1 pair each. So total 2 pairs. So that's the minimal possible for group k. So sum all groups, which gives 2, which is the sample output. So that's correct.

So the approach is to count the number of students per starting letter. Then, for each starting letter, compute the minimal possible pairs (split as evenly as possible), sum them all.

But wait, wait. Let's look at sample input 3:

5 students all named mike. So same starting letter 'm'. So group m has size 5. Split into 2 and 3. So (2 choose 2) + (3 choose 2) → 1 +3 =4. Which is the sample output. So that's correct.

Sample input 1:

4 students: jorge, jose, oscar, jerry.

Groups: j:3 (jorge, jose, jerry), o:1 (oscar).

Group j: split into 1 and 2 → 0 +1 =1. Group o: split into 1 and 0 →0. Total 1. Which matches the sample output.

So this approach seems to work. So the algorithm is:

1. Count the frequency of each starting letter.

2. For each frequency k, compute (a choose 2) + (b choose 2) where a = k//2, b = (k+1)//2.

3. Sum all these values.

So the code can be written as:

Read n, then for each name, count the first letters.

Then, for each count in the counts' values, compute (k//2 * (k//2 -1) // 2) + ( ( (k+1)//2 ) * ( ( (k+1)//2 ) -1 ) // 2 )

Sum all these.

So that's the code.

Wait, but why can't we split the group into other ways? Like, for a group of size 5, if we split into 3 and 2, but perhaps the sum is same as 2 and 3. Oh right, the sum is same. So the minimal is fixed once the group is split as evenly as possible.

Yes. So this approach should work.

So the code will be:

Read all names, count the first letters. Then for each count, compute the minimal pairs. Sum all.

So that's straightforward. Let's test sample input 3.

Sample input 3: 5 mikes. So group m has 5. Split into 2 and 3. (2*1/2) + (3*2/2) → 1 +3 =4. Correct.

Sample input 2: group k with 4. Split 2 and 2. (2*1/2)*2 = 2. Correct.

Sample input 1: group j with 3. Split 1 and 2. (1*0/2) + (2*1/2) → 0 +1 =1. Correct.

Yes. So the code is correct.

So the code would be:

Read n.

Create a frequency dictionary.

For each of the n names:

   first_char = name[0]

   increment frequency[first_char] by 1.

sum = 0

for k in frequency.values():

    a = k //2

    b = k - a

    sum += a*(a-1)//2 + b*(b-1)//2

print(sum)

Yes. That's the code.

Now, let's check sample input 2. Let's see:

Group k has 4 → 2 and 2 → 1+1=2.

Groups g (1), s(1), h(1) → each split into 1 and 0. 0 +0 =0. So sum is 2+0+0+0=2. Correct.

Sample input 3: group m (5) → 2+3. Sum 1+3=4. Correct.

So the code works. So this is the solution.
