Okay, let's see. So the problem is about posterizing an image by grouping colors into consecutive ranges and choosing a key for each group. The goal is to make the output array lexicographically smallest possible. Hmm. Oh right, each group can't be larger than k, and all colors must be covered.

First, I need to figure out how to split the colors [0-255] into groups where each group has size at most k. Then assign each color in a group to the group's key. The keys are chosen such that when we replace the pixels, the resulting array is lex smallest possible.

The key point here is that the lex order depends on the pixel array. So for each color in the original pixel array, after replacing it with the key of its group, the entire array should be lex smallest possible. Lex order means that the first differing element determines which array is smaller. So earlier elements have higher priority.

But wait, the grouping affects all colors, not just the ones present in the input. Because even if a color isn't present in the input, it's part of some group. However, since the pixels are only those in the input, the keys assigned to the groups that the input's colors are in will affect the output. Other groups' keys don't matter. So maybe the problem can be simplified by considering only the colors present in the input, but probably not. Because the groups need to cover all 256 colors, so the way groups are formed around the input colors will affect the grouping of other colors.

Hmm. So the challenge is to partition the 256 colors into groups of size <=k, each group is consecutive. Then for each group, choose a key (any color in the group). The lex smallest array is achieved by selecting groups and keys such that when replacing each pixel's color with its group's key, the array is lex smallest possible.

So, how to model this. Let's think of the process of building the groups. The groups are consecutive, non-overlapping, and cover all 256 colors. Each group has size <=k. The key for the group can be any element in the group. But to get the lex smallest array, for each color in the input, we want the smallest possible key in its group. But wait, maybe that's not the case. Because the lex order is determined by the entire array. For example, maybe in some cases, a larger key in an earlier position allows for smaller keys in later positions, leading to a lex smaller array overall.

But given that the lex order is determined by the first differing element, perhaps the optimal strategy is to greedily choose the smallest possible key for the earliest possible elements. That is, arrange the groups such that the earliest pixels (in the input array) have the smallest possible keys, and for those, the groups are formed in a way that their keys are as small as possible.

But how does grouping affect that? Let's think. Suppose the first pixel in the input array is color c. We need to assign it to a group. The key for that group can be any color in the group. To minimize the first element, we want the key of c's group to be as small as possible. But the group must include c and have size up to k. So the group could be from [start, start + s), where s <=k, and c is in this range. The key is some element in this group. To make the key as small as possible, the group's key would be the start of the group. Because that's the smallest possible in the group. Wait, but the key can be any element in the group. So for example, if the group is [2,4], the key could be 2,3,4. So choosing 2 would give the smallest possible key for that group.

So, for each color, the key of the group is the minimal possible value in the group. Because that would contribute to a lex smaller array. Therefore, to minimize the lex order, each group's key should be the leftmost (smallest) possible element in the group.

But wait, maybe not. Because how the groups are formed affects other groups. For example, if you group [0,1,2] with key 0, then the next group starts at 3. But if you split into [0,1], [2], then the next groups could start at 2. But perhaps that's not allowed if the group must be consecutive. Oh right, the groups must be consecutive and cover all colors. So the entire 0-255 range is partitioned into consecutive intervals of size up to k.

So the problem reduces to partitioning the 0-255 color space into consecutive intervals of size <=k, such that for each color in the input array, when replaced by the leftmost element of its interval (since that's the smallest possible key), the resulting array is lex smallest.

Wait, but the key can be any element in the group. So choosing the leftmost gives the minimal possible value for that group. That would contribute to the lex smallest array. Therefore, for all groups, the key should be the leftmost element. Because that would minimize each key. So the problem becomes: partition the 256 colors into consecutive intervals of size up to k, and the key of each interval is the leftmost element. Then, for each color in the input array, replace it with the key of its interval. The goal is to find the partitioning that leads to the lex smallest possible array.

But how to model this? Because the partitioning of the colors affects which keys are chosen for the input's colors. So the problem is to select such intervals (groups) of consecutive colors, each of size <=k, covering all 0-255, and for each input color, the key is the start of the interval. Then, the resulting array is the lex smallest possible.

But how to find such a partitioning? Let's model this as a dynamic programming problem. Let's consider that the color space is from 0 to 255. We need to divide it into intervals [s_0, e_0], [s_1, e_1], ..., where s_0=0, e_0 = s_0 + l_0 -1, where l_0 <=k. Then s_1 = e_0 + 1, etc. Each interval has length <=k.

The key for each interval is s_i. So, for any color c in the interval [s_i, e_i], its key is s_i.

Our goal is to assign these intervals such that, for the input array, the sequence of s_i's (where each pixel's color is replaced by the s_i of its interval) is lex smallest possible.

So, the problem reduces to choosing the intervals in such a way that the first pixel in the input array is in the earliest possible (smallest) interval, then the next pixel, etc., but this is interdependent because the intervals must cover the entire 256 colors.

Wait, but perhaps the optimal way is to greedily assign the earliest possible intervals for the earliest pixels in the input. For example, the first pixel is color c. We want to assign it to the earliest possible interval (so that its key is as small as possible), but also considering the group's size constraint. So for the first pixel's color c, we can choose to have a group that starts as far left as possible, up to k elements, but such that c is in that group.

But how do the other colors affect this? For example, suppose the first pixel is color 14. To minimize its key, the group that includes 14 should start as far left as possible. So the group would be [s, s + l -1], where s + l -1 >=14, and l <=k, and s is as small as possible. Wait, but s must be <=14. Because the group is consecutive. So the group that contains 14 can start at some s where s <=14 and s + l -1 >=14, and l <=k. To minimize the key (s), we need to choose the earliest possible s such that the group includes 14 and has maximum length up to k. Wait, but for the group that includes 14, the earliest possible s is 14 - (l-1) where l is as large as possible (up to k), but perhaps s can be even lower. Wait, perhaps the group starts at s, and includes 14. The group can start at any s where s <=14 and s + l-1 >=14, l <=k. But to minimize s, perhaps we can start the group at s = max(0, 14 - (k-1)), and then the group covers s to s + (k-1). But if 14 - (k-1) is >=0, then the group is of size k, starting at s =14 - (k-1), up to 14 + (k-1 - (14 - s))? Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's think: For a color c, the earliest possible group that can include it and have maximum possible size (to include as many colors as possible) is s = max(0, c - (k-1)), and the group would be [s, s + k -1]. But if c is in that group, then the key is s. However, this might not be possible if there's a previous group that has already been determined.

But since the groups must be consecutive and non-overlapping, the way we split one group affects the next. For example, if the first group is [0, 2], then the next group starts at 3, etc.

Wait, but the way the groups are formed is a complete partitioning of the entire 0-255 range. So it's like we have to split the entire range into consecutive blocks of size <=k. The key for each block is the leftmost element of the block.

Therefore, the problem is to split the 0-255 range into consecutive intervals, each of size at most k, such that when each pixel in the input is replaced by the left end of its interval, the resulting array is lex smallest.

So, the core idea is to create intervals in such a way that the left ends (keys) for the pixels in the input array are as small as possible, considering the order of the input array.

How can we model this?

Let's consider that the lex order is determined by the first differing pixel. So, the first pixel in the input array that differs between two possible groupings will determine which grouping is better. Therefore, to minimize the lex order, we need to ensure that the earliest possible pixels in the input array have the smallest possible keys.

But how does the grouping affect this? Let's take an example. Suppose the first pixel is 14, and k=3. The possible groups that include 14 could start at 12 (group 12-14, key 12), or 13 (group 13-15, but then 14 is in 13-15, key 13), etc. But if the group starts at 12, then the key is 12, which is smaller than 13. So for the first pixel, we want to assign it to a group with the smallest possible start. So the group that includes 14 should start as far left as possible. But the group's size can't exceed k. So the earliest possible group start is max(0, 14 - (k-1))). For k=3, that's 14-2=12. So group starts at 12, covers 12-14, which is size 3. So key is 12. That's the best possible for that pixel.

But then, the next group starts at 15, and so on. But if the next pixel in the input is, say, 15, then it would be in the next group starting at 15, key 15. Which is worse than if the first group was longer. But perhaps that's unavoidable.

So the key idea is that for each pixel in the input array, in order, we want to have the group that includes that color starts as early as possible, given the previous groups.

But how to model this when the grouping affects all colors. For example, if we split a group early, that might split later colors into higher groups. But perhaps the optimal approach is to greedily create the earliest possible group for the earliest possible pixels, then proceed.

So, perhaps the solution is to process the colors in the order of the input array, and for each color, if it's not already assigned to a group, assign it to the earliest possible group (starting as far left as possible) that includes it and has maximum possible size (up to k). Then, once a group is assigned, all colors in that group are fixed. Then proceed to the next color in the input array that is not yet part of a group, and so on.

But how do we handle overlapping groups? Wait, since the groups are consecutive and non-overlapping, once a group is assigned, the next group starts after the end of the previous one.

Wait, maybe the way to model this is to process the entire color range and split it into intervals in such a way that for each color in the input array (in the order of the input), we try to have the earliest possible group (i.e., the group starts as early as possible) for that color.

But this seems conflicting. For example, if the input has two pixels: 14 and 13. If we process 14 first, and create a group starting at 12 (k=3), then the group for 13 (which is in 12-14) would already have key 12. But if we process 13 first, perhaps we can create a group that starts earlier. Wait, but the input array's order is fixed. The lex order is determined by the output array, which is the same order as the input. So the first pixel's group has the highest priority. Therefore, the approach should be to process the pixels in the order they appear in the input, and for each pixel's color, assign it to the earliest possible group (maximizing the group's start as left as possible), given the existing groups.

But how to manage the groups once they are created. For example, if a group starts at s and ends at e, then the next group starts at e+1. So once a group is created, all colors in [s, e] are assigned to s, and the next group must start at e+1.

Wait, no. Because the entire color range must be partitioned into consecutive intervals. So groups are formed as consecutive blocks. So once a group starts at s, the next group starts at s + l, where l is the size of the first group (<=k). So the partitioning is determined by the starting points and lengths of the groups.

But how to decide these starting points and lengths such that when the pixels are replaced by their group's start, the lex order is minimized.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to split the color range into groups such that the start of each group is as small as possible, but considering the order of the input array. For example, the first pixel in the input array determines the first group that contains its color, and that group is as far left as possible. Then the next groups are determined by the next pixels, but the problem is that the groups are consecutive.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to create the groups in such a way that for each color in the input array (processed in order), the group that includes that color is as far left as possible, given the groups already created.

Let me think through the first example:

Sample Input 1:

4 3

2 14 3 4

Sample Output: 0 12 3 3

Explanation:

Group [0,2] (size 3) key 0. So pixel 2 is replaced with 0.

Group [12-14] (size 3) key 12. Pixel 14 is replaced with 12.

Group [3-5] (size 3) key 3. Pixels 3 and 4 are replaced with 3.

So how were these groups formed?

The first pixel is 2. The earliest possible group is [0,2], size 3, key 0.

Then the next group starts at 3, but the next pixel in the input is 14. So the group for 14 has to start at 12 (because 12-14 is size 3). But how does that fit into the consecutive grouping.

Wait, after group [0-2], the next group starts at 3. Let's say group from 3-5 (size 3). Then group 6-8, etc. Then 14 would be in group 12-14, which would be after group 6-8, but that's not possible because groups are consecutive. So perhaps this approach is not correct.

Wait, I think I'm misunderstanding the grouping. The groups must be consecutive, non-overlapping, and cover all 256 colors. So once a group is formed from s to e, the next group must start at e+1.

So the entire color range is split into intervals [s_0, e_0], [e_0+1, e_1], etc., each of size at most k.

So the order of the groups is fixed. For example, group 0: [0,2], group 1: [3,5], group 2: [6,8], etc. Each group has size up to k. So the group for a color c is determined by where it falls in these consecutive intervals.

The key is that the group must be consecutive and non-overlapping. So the way the groups are formed is entirely determined by the starting points and lengths of each group, but they must form a continuous partition of the color space.

Therefore, the problem is to split the entire color space into such intervals, and the lex smallest array is achieved when the keys (the start of the intervals) for the colors in the input array are as small as possible, considering the order of the input array.

But how to model this.

An alternative approach is to model the problem as trying to find the group boundaries in such a way that for each color in the input array, the group's start (key) is as small as possible, given the constraints of the groups.

But the group boundaries are interdependent. For example, if you split the first group to be [0,2], then the next group starts at 3. If you split the first group as [0,1], then the next group starts at 2, which could allow for a group [2,4] which starts at 2. So, the way to split groups affects the possible start points of groups for colors in the input array.

So the problem is to find a split of the color space into consecutive intervals of size <=k, such that when each color in the input array is replaced with the start of its group, the resulting array is lex smallest.

How can we find such a split?

One possible approach is to model this as a dynamic programming problem. Let's define dp[i] as the lex smallest possible array for the colors up to i. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the entire color space is 256 colors, perhaps we can model this with a DP state that tracks the current position in the color space. For example, for each position s in 0..255, compute the best possible grouping starting from s onwards, considering the previous groups.

But how to incorporate the input array's pixels into this.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to find for each color in the input array, the earliest possible group start that includes that color, and doesn't conflict with previous groups.

But since the groups are consecutive and non-overlapping, once you have a group starting at s and ending at e, the next group starts at e+1. So, the groups are determined by their start and end points. For example, group 0 starts at s0, ends at e0 = s0 + l0 -1 (l0 <=k), group 1 starts at s1 = e0 +1, ends at e1 = s1 + l1 -1, etc.

Therefore, the problem is to determine the lengths l0, l1, ..., such that each li <=k, and the sum of all li is 256. Then, for each color in the input array, find the group it's in, and replace it with the group's start. The goal is to choose the lengths l0, l1, ... such that the resulting array is lex smallest.

But with 256 colors, and each li up to 255 (since k can be up to 256), the number of possible groupings is huge. So a brute-force approach is impossible.

An alternative approach is to find that the lex smallest array is achieved by grouping the colors in the input array in such a way that the earliest occurrence of a color in the input array is assigned to the earliest possible group.

But how?

Let's think of the input array as a sequence of colors. For each color in the input array in order, we want to assign it to the earliest possible group. Once a group is assigned, it determines the start of the next groups. So the first color in the input array must be assigned to a group that starts as early as possible. Let's say the first color is c. The earliest possible group that can include c is max(0, c - (k-1)), so the group is [s, s + l -1], where l is as large as possible (up to k), and s is as small as possible. Then, the next group starts at s + l. The next color in the input array will be assigned to the earliest possible group in the remaining color range.

But this approach is greedy and depends on the order of the input array. For example, if the first color is 14, then the group starts at 12 (assuming k=3), which covers 12-14. The next group starts at 15. Then, if the next input color is 15, the group starts at 15 (size 1), then next group starts at 16, etc.

But how to handle cases where the next color is in the previous group. For example, suppose the first color is 14, group 12-14. The next color is 13. Then 13 is already in the first group, so its key is 12. So that's handled.

So the plan is:

1. Iterate through the input array in order. For each color c in the input array:

   a. If c is already in a previously determined group, do nothing.

   b. Else, determine the earliest possible group that can include c. The earliest possible group is the group that starts as far left as possible, given the current position of the color space (i.e., after the previous group ends). The group must start at the next available color, and include c, with size up to k.

Wait, no. The previous group ends at e_prev. The next group starts at e_prev +1. So the current available starting position is s = e_prev +1. But we need to form a group starting at s, of size up to k, that includes c. But if c < s, then this is impossible. Because the groups must be consecutive, and the next group must start after e_prev.

But that's a problem. For example, if the previous group ends at 2, the next group starts at 3. If a color c=5 is next in the input array, then the group can start at 3 and cover 3-5 (if k=3). But if the next color in the input is 1, which is already covered by the first group.

Wait, but the groups are determined once. So the next group starts after the previous group ends. So if a color is in a previous group, it's already covered, otherwise, it's in the next group. So perhaps the way to form the groups is to greedily create the largest possible groups (up to size k) for the earliest possible colors in the input array.

But how?

Let me think of the process:

The entire color range is split into groups as follows:

- The first group starts at 0. Its size can be up to k. But the group must include the first color in the input array. Wait, no. Because the first group could start at 0 and have size up to k, even if the first color is in that group.

So perhaps the optimal way to create groups is to have each group start as early as possible, but ensuring that the group includes the earliest possible occurrence of an unprocessed color in the input array.

Alternatively, the process could be:

- Find the earliest color in the input array that hasn't been assigned to a group yet.

- Determine the earliest possible group that can include this color. The group starts at s, where s is the next available position (after the previous group ends). The group can be of size up to k, but must include the current color. So s is the next available position, and the group can start from s, and have a size up to min(k, 256 - s). But the group must include the current color. So s must be <= current color <= s + l -1, where l is the group's size (<=k).

Wait, but this would require that s <= current color <= s + l -1. But s is the next available position (after the previous group ends). So if the current color is less than s, then it must have been covered by a previous group. So if a color in the input array is not yet processed, and its value is less than s, that's a problem. Because it should have been covered by a previous group.

So this suggests that the groups are built in a way that covers the entire color space in order, and the input array is processed in such a way that the earliest possible groups are formed to include the earliest pixels in the input array.

But I'm stuck. Let's think of another approach.

The key is that the group's start determines the key for that group. To minimize the lex order of the output array, we want the earliest pixels in the input array to have the smallest possible keys.

So for the first pixel in the input array, its group's start should be as small as possible. The group must include that pixel's color. But the group can be as small as needed (as long as it's <=k), but starting as early as possible.

But the group must be part of the consecutive partitioning of the entire color space.

So, the first group starts at 0, and has a size l0. Then the next group starts at l0, and so on. But to include the first pixel's color, which is c0, we need to have l0 >= (c0 - 0 +1). But no, the group starts at 0 and ends at l0-1. So c0 must be in [0, l0-1]. So to include c0, l0 must be at least c0 +1 (assuming group starts at 0 and ends at l0-1). But the maximum group size is k. So l0 can be min(k, 256 - 0) (but 256 colors, so 0-255). So l0 can be up to k. So the earliest group that includes c0 must start at 0, and have a size at least (c0 +1). But if (c0 +1) >k, then it's impossible, but since group size is up to k, then the earliest possible group would be as large as possible (k), starting at 0, but that may not include c0. Wait, that can't be. Because the groups are consecutive and cover all colors.

Wait, no. The first group starts at 0 and can have length up to k. If the first group has length l0, then it covers 0 to l0-1. So for c0 to be in the first group, it must be that l0-1 >=c0. So l0 >=c0 +1. But l0 can't exceed k. So if c0 >=k, then the first group can't have l0 >k, so c0 is not in the first group. So the first group would be 0 to k-1. Then the next group starts at k. But if the first pixel is c0 =k, then it's in the second group (k ... k + l1-1), which starts at k, and the group's size is up to k.

But then the key for c0 is k. But perhaps this is unavoidable.

But the problem is that the first group's size can be as large as possible (k), but if c0 is in the first group, then the key is 0. Otherwise, the first group is 0 to k-1, and the next group starts at k. But if the first pixel is in the second group, then its key is k, which is worse than if the first group was extended to include it.

Ah, right. So for the first pixel in the input array, c0, we want to have it in the earliest possible group. Which is the first group, starting at 0, and of size at least (c0 +1). But if c0 +1 exceeds k, then the first group can't include it. So we have to split the color space into groups starting at 0, then k, then 2k, etc. But if c0 is in group 0, then its key is 0. If not, then its key is in a higher group.

So the optimal way is to split the groups such that the first group includes c0 and is as large as possible (up to k). But how?

Wait, perhaps the optimal way is to split the color space into groups in such a way that the earliest possible groups include the earliest pixels in the input array, and those groups are as large as possible (up to k), but shifted left to include the pixel.

But I'm not sure how to model this.

Another idea: For the entire color space, the group's start for a color c is the largest possible s such that s <=c, and (c -s) <k, and s is aligned such that the groups are consecutive and non-overlapping. For example, the first group starts at 0, then the next group starts at k, then 2k, etc. But that would be when groups are of maximum size k, but this may not include the color c in the earliest possible group. For example, if k=3 and c=14. Then the group that includes 14 would start at 12 (14 - 2 =12). But if groups are divided as 0-2, 3-5, etc., then 14 is in group 12-14 (starting at 12), which is part of the 12th group (since each group is 3 colors). So in this case, the key is 12.

But how to find the group starts s for each color c such that s is the maximum possible number <=c, and s is congruent to 0 modulo k. No, that's not correct. Because group sizes can vary, as long as each is <=k. So the groups are not necessarily all of size k.

But in the sample input, the first group is [0-2], which is size 3 (k=3). Then the next group is [3-5], but the sample's second group is [12-14], which implies that the groups in between are smaller. Wait, no. The sample's groups are [0-2], then [3-5], but then the next groups could be 6-8, 9-11, 12-14. So 14 is in the 12-14 group. But how does that fit with the input array. The second pixel is 14, which is in the group 12-14, key 12.

But that's possible only if the groups are divided as follows:

Group 0: 0-2 (size 3)

Group 1: 3-5 (size 3)

Group 2:6-8 (size3)

Group 3:9-11 (size3)

Group4:12-14 (size3)

So each group is size3. Then 14 is in group4. But the first group is 0-2. So for the first pixel (2), the key is 0. The second pixel is 14, which is in group4 (12-14), key12. So that's how the sample's output is generated.

But why can't group4 start earlier?

Ah, because the groups must be consecutive. So after group0 (0-2), group1 starts at 3. So group1 is 3-5. Then group2 is 6-8, etc. So 14 is in group4 (12-14). Which is the earliest possible group that includes it. Because if groups are split into size3, then each group starts at multiples of3.

So in this case, the group starts are s = 0,3,6,9,12, etc.

But what if we split the groups into varying sizes, up to k=3. For example, group0 is 0-2 (size3), group1 is 3-4 (size2), then group2 starts at5. Then group2 could be5-7 (size3), group3 8-10, etc. Then 14 could be in a group that starts earlier than 12. For example, group4 could be 11-13 (size3), then group5 is14-16 (but this is beyond 255 for the sample input). Wait, but 14 is in group5 (14-16?), but k=3. So group5's start is 14, size3:14-16. So the key is14. Which is worse than 12 in the sample. So the sample's approach is better.

So the optimal way is to split the groups into as large as possible (k), so that the group starts are as far left as possible. Because larger groups allow for earlier starts for higher colors.

Thus, the optimal group partitioning is to split the color space into groups of size k, starting at 0, k, 2k, etc. But this is only possible if k divides 256. Otherwise, the last group may be smaller. But for example, when k=3 and 256/3 is 85.333. So the first 85 groups are 3*85=255. The 86th group would be of size1 (256-85*3= 256-255=1). But 255+1=256, which is correct.

But this approach ensures that for any color c, the earliest possible group it can be in is the one starting at s = floor(c /k ) *k. So the group for c is s to s +k-1 (if s +k-1 <=255), otherwise s to 255. The key is s.

But wait, this approach would give each group maximum possible size (k), except possibly the last group. This way, the group's start is as far left as possible for each color. So for example, for color14 and k=3, the group starts at 12 (14//3=4.666, floor is 4, 4*3=12). So group12-14. Which is correct for the sample input.

But in this case, the first group is0-2, then3-5, etc. So for any color in the input array, its group's start is (c //k)*k. The key is this start value.

This approach seems to produce the lex smallest possible array. Because for each color in the input array, the key is the earliest possible possible (smallest possible) given the group size constraint. So this would minimize the keys for all colors, leading to the lex smallest array.

But is this always correct?

Let's check the second sample input:

Sample Input 2:

5 2

0 2 1 255 254

Sample Output:0 1 1 254 254

In the sample output, the group for 0 is [0], since k=2. Then group1 is [1-2], key1. Group2 is [3-4], etc. Then group for 255 is [255] (since k=2, but the previous group is 254-255? Wait, no. Let's see.

If k=2, then the groups are:

0-1 (size2), key0?

No, wait, according to the method of splitting into groups of sizek, each starting at multiples ofk. So for k=2, the groups are 0-1 (size2), 2-3, 4-5, etc. So for color2, the group is 2-3, key2. But in the sample output, the second pixel is 2, which is replaced by1. So this suggests that the group for2 is [1-2], key1. Which implies that the group is of size2, starting at1.

Ah, so the previous approach of splitting into groups of sizek starting at multiples ofk is not correct. Because in the sample input2, the groups must have varying starts.

So why is the sample output for the second case possible?

Sample Input2's explanation:

The output is0 1 1 254 254. So the groups are:

-0 is in group [0], key0.

-2 is in group [1-2], key1. So the group starts at1, size2.

-1 is in group [1-2], key1.

-255 is in group [254-255], key254.

-254 is in group [254-255], key254.

This grouping allows for smaller keys for the pixels in the input array. For example, the second pixel (2) is replaced by1 (earlier than if it was in group2-3, key2). Similarly, the third pixel (1) is replaced by1, which is the key of group1-2.

So the grouping is not aligned to multiples ofk. Hence, the earlier approach of splitting into groups of sizek starting at multiples ofk is not optimal.

This means that the grouping must be more flexible. So the optimal grouping is not necessarily to split into groups of maximum possible size. So there's a different approach needed.

So what's the correct way to partition the groups to get the lex smallest array?

The key insight here is that for the lex order, the earliest pixels in the input array must have the smallest possible keys, which requires that their group's start is as small as possible. But the group's start is determined by the previous groups. So the grouping must be such that the earliest pixels' groups are determined first, and the groups for later pixels are determined based on the previous groups.

So the optimal grouping is to greedily process each color in the input array in the order of their occurrence. For each color, if it's not yet assigned to a group, create a group that includes it and starts as early as possible (given the previous groups), and has maximum possible size (up to k). This way, the current color is assigned to the earliest possible group, which gives the smallest possible key, and the group's size is maximized to allow other colors in the input to have their groups start earlier as well.

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize the start of the current group to 0.

2. Iterate through the input array in order. For each color c in the input:

   a. If c is already in a previously created group, skip it.

   b. Else, determine the earliest possible group start s for c. The group start s must be >= the start of the current group. But since groups are consecutive, the current group is determined by the previous groups. Wait, no. Once a group ends at e, the next group starts at e+1.

So groups are formed in consecutive order. So the current position in the color space is the start of the next group.

For example, suppose the first group is [s0, e0]. The next group starts at e0+1, and can be up to sizek. So for the next group, the earliest possible start is e0+1.

But how to find the group that includes c.

So, when processing a new color c that hasn't been assigned yet, the next group must start at the current start position, which is the end of the previous group plus1. The group that includes c must start at current_start and cover c. The maximum possible size of the group is min(k, 255 - current_start +1). So the group can be [current_start, current_start + l -1], where l is up to k.

But to include c, the group must have current_start <= c <= current_start + l -1. And l <=k.

We want to choose the largest possible l (up to k) such that current_start + l -1 >=c, and l <=k.

So l = min(k, c - current_start +1 + (k -1)), wait, no. Let's think:

We need to choose l such that current_start + l -1 >=c. Because the group must include c. Also, l <=k.

So l should be at least (c - current_start +1). But l can't exceed k. So l is set to min(k, 255 - current_start +1) (to avoid exceeding 255). Wait, the maximum possible group size is min(k, 255 - current_start +1). Because the group starts at current_start and can have up to k elements, but can't go beyond 255.

So, the group size l is the minimum between k and (255 - current_start +1), but also, l must be at least (c - current_start +1) to include c. So if (c - current_start +1) >k, then it's impossible. But since groups are consecutive, the current group must include c. But how?

Ah, but if the current start is s, and the next group must start at s. But if c < s, then it's already part of a previous group. But in our processing, we check if c is already assigned. So, if c is not assigned, then s <=c. Because the next group starts at s, which is the earliest possible.

So, when processing c, the current start is s. The group must start at s and include c. So the group's end is min(s + k -1, 255). But if s +k -1 <c, then it's impossible. But since groups are consecutive, this can't happen. Because c must be >=s. But if the current start is s and the next group is supposed to start there, but c is less than s, then c is already covered by a previous group, which contradicts the assumption.

So, when processing c, we can assume that s <=c.

So, the group's end is e = min(s +k -1, 255). If e >=c, then the group [s, e] includes c. Otherwise, it's impossible. But since s <=c and e >=c (because group ends at s +k-1 or 255, whichever is smaller), then the group includes c.

So, the group size is l = e -s +1. Which is up to k.

So, the group is [s, e], and the key is s.

Once this group is created, the next group starts at e+1.

After processing this group, any colors in the input array that fall into this group will have their keys assigned to s.

So the algorithm is:

- Initialize current_start to 0.

- For each color in the input array, in order:

   if the color is already in a group (i.e., it's in [prev_s, prev_e] for some previous group), continue.

   else:

      create a new group starting at current_start. The group's end is min(current_start +k -1, 255). But since current_start <=c, and the group must include c, we need to ensure that the group ends at least at c. So the group's end is max(current_start +k-1, c). Wait, no. Because current_start <=c. The group's end is min(current_start +k-1, 255). If that is >=c, then the group includes c. Otherwise, the group is current_start to 255 (if 255 <c, but that's impossible). So it's guaranteed that the group includes c.

So, the group's end is e = min(current_start +k -1, 255).

But since current_start <=c <=e, the group includes c.

So the group is [current_start, e]. The key is current_start.

Then, set current_start to e+1.

This way, the group for c is as early as possible, and of maximum possible size (up to k), which allows the next groups to start as early as possible for subsequent pixels.

This approach ensures that each color in the input array is processed in order, and its group is formed to include it with the earliest possible start. This way, the lex smallest possible array is generated.

Let's test this approach with the sample inputs.

Sample Input1:

4 3

2 14 3 4

Processing in order:

First color is 2.

current_start is 0.

Group is [0, min(0+3-1,255)] = [0,2]. Includes 2.

Key is 0.

current_start becomes3.

Next color is14.

current_start is3.

Group is [3, 3+3-1=5]. But 14 is not in [3,5]. So this can't be. But current_start is3, and group must include14. So group's end is min(3+3-1,255) =5, which is less than14. So this group is [3,5], but 14 is not in it. But according to the algorithm, we process the color in the input array in order, and if it's not already in a group, create a group starting at current_start. But current_start is3, which is <=14. The group's end is min(3+3-1,255) =5. So the group is [3,5], which doesn't include14. So this approach is not correct.

Wait, so this indicates a flaw in the algorithm. Because the group created for color2 is [0-2], current_start is3. When processing color14, which is not in any group, the group created is [3-5], which does not include14. But the group must include14.

So the algorithm as described would not work.

Ah, this is the crux of the problem. The algorithm must create a group that includes the current color. So, when processing a color c that is >=current_start, the group must start at current_start and include c. So the group's end must be >=c.

But the group's end is min(current_start +k-1, 255). But if current_start +k-1 <c, then this is impossible. So the group's end must be at least c. So the group's end is max( current_start +k-1, c ), but not exceeding 255.

So the group's end is e = min( max( current_start +k-1, c ), 255 )

But then the group's size is e - current_start +1, which may exceed k. Which is not allowed.

So this is a problem. For example, if current_start is3, k=3, c=14. Then current_start +k-1 =5 <14. So the group's end would be14, which is larger than current_start +k-1. So group size is14-3+1=12, which is larger than k=3. This is not allowed.

So the algorithm must ensure that the group's size is at most k. So in this case, if c is >= current_start +k, then the group can't include c. But that's impossible, because groups are consecutive and must cover all colors. So c must be in some group.

But according to the problem's constraints, each group must be consecutive and of size <=k. So how can a color c=14 be included in a group starting at3, when k=3? The group would be [3,5], which is size3, but14 is not in it. The next group starts at6, size3 (6-8), then9-11, then12-14. So the group for14 is12-14. So the key is12.

But according to the algorithm described earlier, when processing14, the current_start is3. The group is formed as [3,5], which doesn't include14. Then current_start becomes6. The next group is6-8, current_start becomes9. Then group9-11, current_start becomes12. Then group12-14, which includes14. But how does the algorithm know to create groups until the group that includes14?

It seems that the algorithm described earlier is insufficient, because processing a color in the input array may not be in the group created during its processing. So the algorithm needs to create all groups up to the one that contains the current color, but that's not possible with a simple per-pixel processing.

So this suggests that the initial approach is incorrect. We need a different way to model the grouping.

Alternative idea: For each color c in the input array, in order, we need to determine which group it belongs to. To find the earliest possible group for c, which is the earliest group in the partitioning that includes c. This group's start is the earliest possible, given the previous groups.

But how to determine this.

Perhaps the groups are determined in such a way that each group starts at the earliest possible position, given the previous groups, and is of size as large as possible (up to k). So the entire color space is divided into groups of size up to k, starting from 0, and each group is as large as possible. So the groups are 0-2,3-5,6-8,... etc. Each group is of size k, except the last one.

But in this case, the group for c is s = (c //k ) *k. So for c=14, k=3, s=12. Which is the case in the first sample input. So this approach would work for the first sample, but not for the second sample.

But the second sample's correct grouping requires that group starts are not multiples of k.

So this approach works for the first sample but not the second.

Thus, the algorithm must be different.

Another approach: For each color in the input array, we need to find the earliest possible group start s such that s <=c and s is the start of a group of size up to k, and the groups are consecutive.

The groups are determined by their start positions s_0, s_1, ..., where each s_i = s_{i-1} + l_{i-1}, where l_{i-1} is the size of the previous group (<=k).

The earliest possible group for c is the first group in this sequence that contains c.

But how to determine this sequence.

This seems to be a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming.

Let's model the problem as follows: For each possible start position s (0 to 255), compute the earliest possible grouping for the colors from s onwards, such that the lex smallest array is achieved.

But with 256 possible start positions and 256 colors, the DP state can be manageable.

The idea is to find for each s, the best grouping (the one that leads to the lex smallest array) for the colors >=s.

But how to define the recurrence.

The key is to process the input array's colors in order. For each color c in the input array, the group that includes c is determined by the earliest possible s that allows a group of size up to k starting at s, and includes c. Once this group is chosen, the remaining colors are handled in the same way.

But this is not straightforward.

Another idea: Precompute for each color c, the earliest possible group start s that includes c, and is part of a valid grouping.

The group start s for c is the maximum possible s <=c such that s is the start of a group, and the group size is such that s + l -1 >=c (l <=k), and the groups are consecutive.

But this depends on the groups before s.

Alternatively, the earliest possible group start for c is s = max(0, c - (k-1)), but then the group is [s, s +k-1], which includes c and has size k. But if this is possible (i.e., s <=c and s +k-1 >=c), then this is the earliest possible group for c. But this may not be possible if previous groups are already established.

But how to handle previous groups.

This seems to be a dead end. Perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the optimal group for each color in the input array is the earliest possible group that includes it, and the groups are formed by merging colors into the earliest possible group.

But how to implement this.

An alternative approach inspired by the second sample:

Sample Input 2:

5 2

0 2 1 255 254

Output:0 1 1 254 254

The groups are:

[0] (size1, key0).

[1,2] (size2, key1).

[3,4], etc.

[254,255] (size2, key254).

So the group for2 is [1,2], which starts at1. But according to the previous approach of groups of sizek=2, the group for2 would start at2 (if groups are 0-1, 2-3, etc.), which would key2. But the sample shows that grouping1-2 gives a better lex order.

This suggests that for the second pixel (color2), we can create a group that starts at1 (even though that leaves the previous group [0] which is size1, which is allowed).

So the groups can have varying sizes, as long as each is <=k. And the way to create them is such that earlier pixels in the input array get their groups started as early as possible, even if that means leaving gaps in previous groups.

But how?

The key insight here is that the groups must be consecutive, but their sizes can vary. So the first group can be of size1 (start0, end0), the next group starts at1. So the next group can be of size2 (1-2), which includes colors1 and2.

Thus, the grouping for the second sample is possible.

So the way to create the groups is to process the input array in order, and for each color c in the input array, if it's not yet in a group, create a group that starts as early as possible (given the previous groups) and includes c, with size as large as possible (up to k). This may involve creating a group that starts at s >= previous group's end+1.

But how to track the previous groups' ends.

Wait, the groups are consecutive. So the first group is [0,0], size1. Then the next group starts at1. It can be size2, covering1-2. Then the next group starts at3.

So for the second sample:

- First pixel is0: not in any group. Create group0-0 (size1). Key0. Next group starts at1.

- Second pixel is2: not in any group. Create group1-2 (size2). Key1. Next group starts at3.

- Third pixel is1: already in group1-2. Key1.

- Fourth pixel is255: not in any group. The next group starts at3. To include255, we need to create a group that starts at3 and has size2 (3-4), but this doesn't include255. So this approach doesn't work.

Wait, but in the sample, the group for255 is254-255. So groups must have been created such that the group for254 starts at254. How?

Ah, perhaps the algorithm is to process each color in the input array in order, and for each ungrouped color c, create a group that starts at the earliest possible position (given previous groups) and includes c, with size up to k.

For example:

Sample Input2:

Processing pixels in order:0,2,1,255,254.

- 0 is ungrouped. Earliest possible group starts at0. To include0, group can be [0,0] (size1) or [0,1] (size2). But since the group can be size up to k=2. So group is [0,1], key0. But then the next group starts at2.

But this would include0 and1. But the sample's first group is [0], key0. So why isn't the group larger?

Because creating a group of size2 (0-1) would allow the second pixel (2) to be in group2-3, key2, which is larger than1 in the sample's output. So creating a smaller group for0 allows for a larger group for2.

Ah, so the optimal way is to create a group that starts at0, of size1 (so that the next group starts at1). Then, when processing2, the group starts at1. So the group is [1,2], key1. This way, the second pixel is replaced by1, which is smaller than if the group started at2.

Thus, the algorithm must create the smallest possible group for earlier pixels to allow later pixels to be in groups with smaller keys.

This suggests that the groups for earlier pixels in the input array should be as small as possible (but at least size1), to allow later pixels to be in groups with smaller keys.

But how to model this.

The problem now seems to require a greedy approach where for each color in the input array, we create a group that starts as early as possible (given previous groups) and has the smallest possible size that includes the color. This way, the next groups can start earlier, allowing for smaller keys for subsequent pixels.

But how to compute this.

An alternative approach is to process the input array in order and for each color c:

- If c is already in a group, skip.

- Else, determine the earliest possible group start s (>= current start) such that the group [s, s + l -1] includes c, where l is the smallest possible (1 <= l <=k). But this would create a group of size1 for c, so that the next groups can start earlier.

But this is not correct. For example, if c is part of a group that is as small as possible (size1), then the next group starts at c+1. But this may allow for larger groups for later colors.

For example, in sample input2:

Processing0:

Create group0-0. Next start is1.

Processing2:

Create group1-2 (size2). Next start is3.

Processing1: already in group1-2.

Processing255: create group3-3+1=3-4. But 255 is not in this group. So this approach doesn't work.

Ah, so this approach is not working.

So perhaps the correct approach is to create the largest possible group for the current color c that starts at the earliest possible position, given previous groups, and has size up to k. Because creating a larger group for c allows more colors to be covered, which may help subsequent pixels.

But how to balance between creating larger groups (which covers more colors and may allow subsequent pixels to be in earlier groups) and creating smaller groups (which allows later pixels to be in earlier groups).

This seems complex.

Another idea: For each color c in the input array, in order, the earliest possible group start s that includes c is the current start. The group can be of size up to k, but must include c. So s <=c <=s + l -1 <=s +k -1. We want to set l to the maximum possible (up to k) such that s +l -1 >=c. So l = min(k, 255 -s +1) but also l >=c -s +1.

So for example, in sample input2:

current_start is0.

Processing0: group size can be up to 2. c=0 is in s=0. l can be min(2, 255-0+1) =2. So group is0-1. But the next group starts at2. Processing the next pixel, 2, which is in group2-3 (size2), key2. But sample output requires it to be replaced by1. So this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, when processing0, the group could be made of size1 (0-0), so that the next group starts at1. Then, processing2, create group1-2 (size2). Key1.

This is better for the second pixel's key.

So the optimal group size for the first color is 1, not the maximum possible, to allow later pixels to have smaller keys.

This suggests that the group size should be chosen to be as small as possible (but >=1) to allow the next group to start earlier. But how to decide when to make the group smaller.

But this requires that the group includes the current color c, and the next group can start as early as possible.

So for each color c in the input array, in order:

- If it's not yet in a group:

   - The group must start at current_start.

   - The group's end is the minimum between current_start +k-1 and 255, but must be >=c.

   - But the group's end can be as small as possible (as small as c), to allow the next group to start earlier.

So the group's size is (c - current_start +1). This way, the group includes c and is as small as possible, allowing the next group to start at c+1.

But this would make the group's size exactly (c - current_start +1), which can be up to k.

Wait, but if (c - current_start +1) >k, then it's impossible. So the group's size must be at least (c - current_start +1), but can't exceed k.

So the group's size is min(k, 255 - current_start +1), but also at least (c - current_start +1).

But if (c - current_start +1) >k, then it's impossible. But this can't happen because current_start <=c, and group must include c. So current_start +k-1 >=c.

But current_start is the start of the group. The group must include c, and the group's size is up to k.

So, group's size l is max( (c - current_start +1), min(k, 255 - current_start +1) )? No, that's not right. Because the group must have size <=k. So l is min(k, 255 - current_start +1), but also must include c. So if current_start +k-1 >=c, then l is min(k, 255 - current_start +1). But if current_start +k-1 <c, then it's impossible.

But since the group must cover all colors, the groups must be consecutive. So the group starts at current_start, has size l (<=k), and covers current_start to current_start +l-1. Then, current_start is updated to current_start + l.

So for the group to include c, current_start must <=c < current_start +l.

So, l must be >= c - current_start +1.

But l is at most k. So, if (c - current_start +1) >k, then it's impossible. But this can't happen because the groups are consecutive and cover all colors. So current_start is the next available position. So the group starts at current_start, and must include c. But current_start <=c.

So, for example, if k=3, current_start=3, and c=14. The group must start at3, and include14. So group size is min(3, 255-3+1)=3. So group3-5. But 5 <14. This group doesn't include14. But according to the problem's constraints, all colors must be covered by groups. So the groups must be formed in a way that covers all colors. So the group after3-5 is6-8, etc. Until14 is in a group.

But how to ensure that the group including14 is processed when processing the input array.

This suggests that the algorithm must create groups for all colors up to and including the colors in the input array. But how to do this efficiently.

An alternative approach is to precompute the groups in such a way that each group is formed to include the earliest possible colors in the input array, and the groups are as small as possible to allow subsequent groups to start earlier.

But this is vague.

Perhaps the correct way to model this is to process the input array in order and, for each color c not yet in a group, create a group that starts at the earliest possible position (current_start) and includes c, with size as small as possible (exactly c - current_start +1, but up to k).

Wait, but this is similar to the earlier approach.

For example, in sample input1:

Processing color2:

current_start is0.

The group must start at0. The minimum size is 3 (0-2) to include2. So group is0-2 (size3). Next current_start is3.

Processing color14:

current_start is3. The group must start at3. To include14, the size must be14-3 +1 =12, which is larger thank=3. So group size is3 (3-5). This group doesn't include14. So current_start becomes6. Then create group6-8. current_start becomes9. Group9-11. current_start becomes12. Group12-14 (size3). Now, this group includes14. So the group's key is12.

So when processing14, we have to create all the groups until the one that includes14.

But how to do this efficiently.

The algorithm would have to:

For each color c in the input array:

   if c is already in a group, continue.

   else:

      while current_start <=c:

          create a group starting at current_start, with size min(k, 255 - current_start +1). This group includes current_start to current_start + l -1.

          current_start += l

      Now, c is in some group. Find that group.

But this would create groups for all colors up to and including c. But this is done for each color in the input array, in order.

But this approach would process the input array colors in order, and create groups to cover them. However, this could result in O(n) * O(256/k) operations, which is acceptable for n up to 1e5 and k up to 256.

But how to find the group for a color c after creating all groups up to c.

Once the groups are created, for each color c, we can precompute the group's start s. This can be done by noting that the group start is the floor division of (c) into multiples of k. But this is only true if the groups are created in sizes of k. But when groups are created in varying sizes, this is not applicable.

So the algorithm must track the groups as they are created.

An efficient way to do this is to precompute a lookup table that maps each color to its group's start. Initially, all colors are unassigned. As groups are created, the lookup table is filled in for the colors in those groups.

So the steps would be:

1. Initialize current_start =0.

2. Create a list of groups.

3. Create a list 'groups' which stores tuples (start, end).

4. For each color c in the input array, in order:

   a. If lookup_table[c] is already set, continue.

   b. Else:

      i. While current_start <=c:

           - Create a new group starting at current_start. The group's size is min(k, 255 - current_start +1).

           - The end of the group is current_start + size -1.

           - Add this group to 'groups'.

           - For each color in [current_start, end], set lookup_table[color] = current_start.

           - current_start = end +1.

      ii. Now, lookup_table[c] is set.

This way, for each color c in the input array, we ensure that all groups up to and including c's group are created, and c is mapped to its group's start.

This approach ensures that groups are created in consecutive order, each of size up to k. Each group is created as early as possible, with size up to k, to cover the current color c.

But this approach is not correct for the second sample.

Sample Input2:

0,2,1,255,254.

Processing the first pixel,0:

current_start is0. Create group0-1 (size2), lookup_table for0 and1 are set to0. current_start becomes2.

But in the sample, group0 is size1. So this approach would set the first group to0-1, which would map0 and1 to0. The second pixel is2. current_start is2. Create group2-3 (size2). Map2 and3 to2. But the sample's output for pixel2 is1, which is not possible. So this approach would fail.

This indicates that the algorithm is not correct.

So, the problem with this approach is that it creates groups of maximum possible size, which may cause later pixels to be assigned to higher keys than possible.

Thus, the algorithm must be adjusted to create groups of varying sizes, possibly smaller than k, to allow earlier groups for later pixels.

The key insight is to create the smallest possible group that includes the current color, allowing the next groups to start earlier.

Thus, when processing a color c, the group should start at current_start and have size exactly (c - current_start +1), if this is <=k. Otherwise, the group is of size k.

For example:

Sample Input2:

Processing0:

current_start=0.

Group size is0-0 (size1), since0-0+1=1 <=k=2.

Map0 to0. current_start becomes1.

Processing2:

current_start is1.

Group size is2-1+1=2. Which is <=k=2. So group1-2 (size2). Map1 and2 to1. current_start becomes3.

Processing1: already mapped to1.

Processing255:

current_start=3. But255 >=3. So create group3-4 (size2). current_start=5. Continue creating groups of size2 until current_start +2-1 >=255.

This would take a long time. But since the maximum current_start is255, which is O(1) steps.

But this approach would create group254-255 (size2) starting at254. So the key is254.

Processing254:

current_start=254. Group254-255, mapped to254.

Thus, the output would be0,1,1,254,254, which matches the sample.

Thus, this algorithm seems to work.

The algorithm is:

- For each color c in the input array, in order:

   if c is already mapped to a group, continue.

   else:

      s = current_start

      l = min(k, 255 - s +1)

      required_l = c - s +1

      if required_l <= l:

          l = required_l

      else:

          l = min(k, 255 - s +1)

      create group s to s + l -1.

      for i in s to s + l -1:

          lookup_table[i] = s

      current_start = s + l

This way, when processing c, the group is created to be as small as possible (just enough to include c), up to size k.

This ensures that the next groups can start as early as possible, allowing subsequent pixels to have their groups start earlier.

Let's test this with sample input2:

Processing0:

s=0.

required_l=0-0+1=1 <=k=2.

So l=1.

Group0-0. lookup_table[0] =0. current_start=1.

Processing2:

s=1.

required_l=2-1+1=2 <=k=2.

l=2.

Group1-2. lookup_table[1]=1, 2=1. current_start=3.

Processing1: already in group1.

Processing255:

s=3.

required_l=255-3+1=253. But k=2. So l=2.

Group3-4. current_start=5.

This repeats until s reaches254.

When s=254:

required_l=255-254+1=2 <=k=2.

Group254-255. lookup_table[254]=254, 255=254. current_start=256.

Processing254:

Already in group254-255.

Thus, the output is0,1,1,254,254.

Which matches the sample.

Now, let's test sample input1:

Sample Input1:

4 3

2,14,3,4.

Processing2:

current_start=0.

required_l=2-0+1=3 <=k=3.

Group0-2. current_start=3. lookup_table[0-2] =0.

Processing14:

current_start=3.

required_l=14-3+1=12>3.

So l=3. Group3-5. current_start=6.

required_l=14-6+1=9>3.

Group6-8. current_start=9.

required_l=14-9+1=6>3. Group9-11. current_start=12.

required_l=14-12+1=3<=3.

Group12-14. lookup_table[12-14]=12. current_start=15.

Thus, 14's key is12.

Processing3:

current_start=3. But 3 is in group3-5. lookup_table[3]=3.

Processing4:

3 is in group3-5. current_start is6.

4 is in group3-5. lookup_table[4]=3.

So the output is0,12,3,3.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, this algorithm seems to work.

So the algorithm is:

For each color in the input array, in order:

   if it's already in a group, skip.

   else:

      create a group that starts at current_start, includes the color c, and has size as small as possible (exactly c - current_start +1) if that's <=k, otherwise size k.

      update the lookup_table for all colors in the group.

      set current_start to the end of the group +1.

Thus, the code will need to:

- Iterate through the input array.

- For each color, if not processed, create the groups from current_start up to the color's group.

- For each group created, fill the lookup_table with the group's start.

Now, to implement this efficiently.

But with n up to 1e5 and k up to 256, and 256 colors, this approach is feasible.

The key is that for each color in the input array, when it's not in the lookup_table, we create groups from current_start until we include the color.

But for example, if the input array has a lot of colors that are not in order, this may create many groups. But since there are at most 256 colors, the total number of groups is 256 /k, which is manageable.

Implementing this:

We'll create a lookup_table of size 256, initialized to -1.

current_start =0.

For each color c in the input array:

   if lookup_table[c] !=-1: continue.

   else:

      while current_start <=c:

          required_l = c - current_start +1

          if required_l >k:

              l = min(k, 255 - current_start +1)

          else:

              l = required_l

          end = current_start + l -1

          # fill the lookup_table for current_start to end.

          for i in range(current_start, end +1):

              lookup_table[i] = current_start

          current_start = end +1

Thus, for each color c in the input array, when it's not yet processed, the code creates groups until current_start passes c, ensuring that c is included in one of the groups.

This way, the code processes the input array in order, and creates groups on the fly.

The inner loop (for i in range(current_start, end+1)) is O(k) per group. Since there are O(256/k) groups, the total time for all groups is O(256) steps, which is acceptable.

But for large k (like k=256), this is O(1) steps per group.

Thus, the total time complexity is O(n + 256) = O(n), which is acceptable for n=1e5.

Once the lookup_table is built, the output array is simply [lookup_table[c] for c in the input array].

Thus, the code will:

- Read n and k.

- Read the array of pixels.

- Initialize lookup_table = [-1] * 256.

- current_start =0.

- For each c in the pixel array:

   if lookup_table[c] == -1:

       while current_start <=c:

           required_l = c - current_start +1

           if required_l >k:

               l = min(k, 255 - current_start +1)

           else:

               l = required_l

           end = current_start + l -1

           # fill the lookup_table

           for i in range(current_start, end+1):

               lookup_table[i] = current_start

           current_start = end +1

- Then, output the lookup_table for each pixel in the input.

But this has a problem. The while loop in the code runs as long as current_start <=c. For example, when processing c=14 and current_start=3, the code will:

required_l =14-3+1=12>3 (k=3). So l = min(3, 255-3+1)=3.

Create group3-5, current_start=6.

Then, loop again since6 <=14.

required_l =14-6+1=9>3. l=3. group6-8. current_start=9.

Loop again.

required_l=14-9+1=6>3. l=3. group9-11. current_start=12.

Loop again.

required_l=14-12+1=3 <=3. l=3. group12-14. current_start=15.

Thus, the code correctly creates the groups for3-5,6-8,9-11,12-14.

But the inner for loop will fill the lookup_table for these ranges. So for group3-5, all colors3-5 are mapped to3. But according to the first sample's explanation, group3-5 is mapped to3, but the pixel3 is replaced with3, which is correct.

But in the first sample's output, the third pixel is3, which is mapped to3, and the fourth pixel is4, also mapped to3.

Thus, this approach correctly generates the sample outputs.

Thus, the code should work correctly.

Now, to implement this in Python.

But there's a possible optimization. The inner loop for filling the lookup_table can be replaced with a range assignment. But in Python, for efficiency, we can calculate the start and end of the group and set all entries in lookup_table from start to end to start.

But in Python, for large ranges, this can be done with:

for i in range(current_start, end +1):

    lookup_table[i] = current_start

But if k is up to 256, this loop is O(256) per group. For 256 colors, this is O(256*256) steps in the worst case (when k=1). Which is 65536 steps. For n=1e5, this is manageable.

But in Python, even 1e5 steps are acceptable.

Thus, the code can be written as follows:

Read n and k.

Read the list of pixels.

Initialize lookup_table as a list of 256 elements, all -1.

current_start =0.

For each c in the list of pixels:

   if lookup_table[c] ==-1:

       while current_start <=c:

           required_l = c - current_start +1

           if required_l >k:

               l = min(k, 255 - current_start +1)

           else:

               l = required_l

           end = current_start + l -1

           for i in range(current_start, end+1):

               lookup_table[i] = current_start

           current_start = end +1

Finally, output the lookup_table for each pixel.

But in the code, even if multiple pixels are in the same group, the code will check for lookup_table[c] ==-1. Once the group is created, any subsequent pixels in that group will have lookup_table[c] set, so no processing is needed.

This approach should work correctly and efficiently.

Let's test this code with sample input2:

Sample input2:

5 2

0 2 1 255 254

Processing0:

lookup_table[0] is-1.

current_start is0.

required_l=0-0+1=1 <=2.

l=1.

end=0.

loop for i in0-0: lookup_table[0]=0.

current_start=1.

Next, processing2:

lookup_table[2] is-1.

current_start=1 <=2.

required_l=2-1+1=2 <=2.

l=2.

end=1+2-1=2.

loop for i in1-2: set to1.

current_start=3.

Processing1: already set.

Processing255:

lookup_table[255] is-1.

current_start=3 <=255.

required_l=255-3+1=253>2.

l= min(2, 255-3+1) = min(2,253)=2.

end=3+2-1=4.

loop for i in3-4: set to3.

current_start=5.

Again, current_start=5 <=255.

required_l=255-5+1=251>2.

l= min(2, 255-5+1)=2.

end=5+2-1=6.

loop for i in5-6: set to5.

current_start=7.

This loop continues until current_start reaches254.

current_start=254.

required_l=255-254+1=2 <=2.

l=2.

end=254+2-1=255.

loop for i in254-255: set to254.

current_start=256.

Thus, lookup_table[255] is254.

Processing254:

lookup_table[254] is-1.

current_start=256>254. So no loop.

Thus, the code would have already processed254 when processing255.

No. Because when processing255, the code loops until current_start exceeds255. So when current_start is254, it creates a group of size2 (254-255). So lookup_table[254] is254.

Thus, the code correctly processes all pixels.

Thus, the code should work correctly.

The final code in Python:

Read n, k.

pixels = list of integers.

lookup = [-1]*256

current_start =0

for c in pixels:

    if lookup[c] ==-1:

        while current_start <=c:

            required = c - current_start +1

            if required >k:

                l = min(k, 255 - current_start +1)

            else:

                l = required

            end = current_start + l -1

            for i in range(current_start, end+1):

                if i >=256:

                    break

                lookup[i] = current_start

            current_start = end +1

            if current_start >255:

                break

output = [lookup[c] for c in pixels]

print(' '.join(map(str, output)))

But we need to handle cases where current_start exceeds 255.

Wait, in Python, range(current_start, end+1) will automatically not generate numbers beyond 255. So even if end is 255, it's handled.

But in code, current_start can be 256, but the loop while current_start <=c will not run, since 256 <=255 is false.

Thus, the code is correct.
