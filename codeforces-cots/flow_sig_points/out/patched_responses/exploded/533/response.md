Okay, I need to solve this problem where Master Yang has to buy attributes to defeat the monster, and I have to find the minimum cost. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, let's understand the battle mechanics. Each second, both Yang and the monster take damage. The damage Yang deals to the monster is max(0, ATK_Y - DEF_M), and vice versa. These happen at the same time. For Yang to win, after this simultaneous attack, the monster's HP must be <=0, and Yang's HP must still be >0.

So the key is to model the battle correctly. The problem is to determine the minimal cost of increasing Yang's HP, ATK, and DEF such that he can win the battle.

The initial values are given, and the shop prices are h, a, d per unit for HP, ATK, DEF respectively. We can buy any number of each (as long as the new values are >= the original, I think. Wait, no. The problem says "buy attributes" which implies that you can only increase them. Because you can't decrease, since that would require selling, but the problem doesn't mention that. So, all attributes can be increased by purchasing, but not decreased. So, when we compute the possible values for Yang's ATK, DEF, and HP, they can be >= their initial values.

So the variables we need to consider are the possible values of ATK_Y (initial ATKY plus some purchased points), DEF_Y (same), and HP_Y (same). We need to find the combination of these such that in the battle, Yang wins, and the total cost (h*(HPY_new - HPY_initial) + a*(ATKY_new - ATKY_initial) + d*(DEFY_new - DEFY_initial)) is minimized.

Now, the challenge is to find the minimal cost combination.

Let's think about how to model the battle. For given values of ATK_Y (A), DEF_Y (D), HP_Y (H), can Yang win?

The battle proceeds in rounds. Each round:

- Monster's HP decreases by max(0, A - DEFM). Let's call this dmg_to_monster.
- Yang's HP decreases by max(0, ATKM - D). Let's call this dmg_to_yang.

These happen at the same time. So, the battle ends after t seconds where:

monster's HP after t hits is <=0, and Yang's HP after t hits is >0.

So, for Yang to win, we need:

H - t * dmg_to_yang > 0, and

HPM <= t * dmg_to_monster.

But wait, since the damage is applied simultaneously. So after t rounds, the monster's HP is HPM - t * dmg_to_monster <=0. But Yang's HP is H - t * dmg_to_yang. It must be >0.

But what if in the t-th round, both the monster and Yang's HP reach zero or below? Then Yang loses because his HP is not >0.

So, the conditions are:

dmg_to_monster must be >0. Otherwise, the monster's HP never decreases, so Yang can't win. So A must be greater than DEFM. Otherwise, no matter how long the battle goes, the monster's HP won't decrease. So first check if A (Yang's ATK) after buying is > DEFM. If not, it's impossible to win, so we can't choose that combination.

Similarly, if dmg_to_yang (ATKM - D) is <=0, then Yang's HP doesn't decrease. So as long as his initial HP is positive, he will survive.

So, the steps are:

For all possible values of A (>= initial ATKY), D (>= initial DEFY), H (>= initial HPY), check if:

1. A > DEFM (so dmg_to_monster = A - DEFM >0)
2. Compute t = ceil(HPM / (A - DEFM)) (the number of rounds needed to kill the monster)
3. Compute the damage Yang takes in t rounds: t * max(0, ATKM - D)
   Then Yang's HP after t rounds is H_initial + (H - initial HPY) (since H is the new HP) minus t * dmg_to_yang. Wait, no. H is the new HP after buying. So Yang's starting HP in the battle is H (which is initial HPY plus any purchased points). So after t rounds, his HP is H - t * dmg_to_yang. This must be >0.

So the condition is H - t * dmg_to_yang > 0.

So the steps for a given A, D, H are:

If A <= DEFM: cannot kill monster, skip.

Else:

t = ceil(HPM / (A - DEFM))  → because each attack does (A - DEFM) damage. So after t rounds, monster's HP is HPM - t*(A - DEFM) ≤0. So t is the minimal integer such that t*(A - DEFM) ≥ HPM. So t = ceil(HPM / (A - DEFM)).

Then, compute dmg_per_round = max(0, ATKM - D). So in t rounds, Yang's HP is H - t*dmg_per_round. This must be >0.

If H - t*dmg_per_round >0 → valid.

So, for a given A and D, the minimal H required is H > t*dmg_per_round. Since H must be at least initial HPY. So the minimal H for given A and D is max(initial HPY, t*dmg_per_round + 1). Because H must be >= initial HPY (since you can't decrease it), and also must be > t*dmg_per_round. So H needs to be at least max(HPY_initial, t*dmg_per_round +1). If this is possible, then the cost for H is h*(H - HPY_initial), and similarly for A and D.

So the problem reduces to iterating over possible values of A and D, compute the minimal required H, and then calculate the total cost. Then find the minimal cost among all possible (A, D, H) combinations that satisfy the conditions.

But the question is: how to iterate through possible A and D values efficiently, given that the initial values can be up to 100, and the constraints on A and D are that they can be increased. However, since the time and memory constraints are tight (1 sec per test case), we need to find a way to bound the possible values of A and D.

So, what's the maximum possible A and D we need to consider?

Let's think. For A (Yang's ATK), the minimum required is DEFM + 1, otherwise he can't deal damage. But perhaps even higher A may lead to lower cost. For example, increasing A could reduce t (number of rounds), which in turn reduces the required H (since H must be > t*dmg_per_round). But increasing A may cost more. So there's a trade-off.

Similarly, increasing D (DEF) reduces dmg_per_round (since dmg_per_round is max(0, ATKM - D)). So higher D can reduce the required H, but again, increasing D costs.

So we need to find the optimal A and D in a range that's feasible, but not too large.

Let's think about possible ranges for A and D.

For A:

The minimal possible A is DEFM + 1 (since A must be > DEFM). However, if the initial ATKY is already > DEFM, then the minimal A is initial ATKY. So the possible A starts from max(initial ATKY, DEFM +1). Wait, no: the initial ATKY could be less than DEFM. Then Yang has to buy ATK points to reach at least DEFM +1.

Wait, the problem says that he can buy any number of attributes, but the initial values are given. So the new ATKY is initial ATKY + x, where x >=0. So for A (the new ATKY), possible values are ATKY_initial <= A <= some maximum.

What's the maximum possible A we need to consider? Well, if A is very high, then t (number of rounds) becomes 1. So the minimal t is 1. So for example, if A is DEFM + HPM, then t is 1. But increasing A beyond that is unnecessary. So the maximum A we need to consider is DEFM + HPM. Because any higher A would still have t=1, but higher cost. So for A, the maximum possible we need to check is DEFM + HPM. Because any higher A than that would just cost more and not reduce t further.

Similarly, for D (DEF), the maximum possible value that makes sense is ATKM. Because if D is >= ATKM, then dmg_per_round is 0. So H needs to be >=1 (since after t rounds, H -0 must be >0 → H>0). But since H is at least initial HPY (which is >=1), as long as D >= ATKM, then H can be as low as initial HPY. But if initial HPY is high enough, then D can be increased to reach ATKM, and H may not need to be increased. So the maximum D we need to consider is ATKM. Because any D beyond that doesn't reduce dmg_per_round (since it's already zero).

So for A, possible values range from max(ATKY_initial, DEFM + 1) to DEFM + HPM. Because any higher A won't reduce t (since t is 1), but will cost more.

For D, possible values range from DEFY_initial to ATKM. Because any higher D than ATKM gives the same effect (dmg_per_round 0), but higher cost.

But wait, DEFY_initial could be already >= ATKM. In that case, D can stay as DEFY_initial, or any higher (but higher would cost more). So the minimal D is DEFY_initial, and the maximum is max(DEFY_initial, ATKM). Because if DEFY_initial is already >= ATKM, then D can stay as DEFY_initial, and higher values would be possible but not necessary.

So the possible D values are from DEFY_initial to max(DEFY_initial, ATKM).

But wait, even if DEFY_initial is higher than ATKM, perhaps buying more DEF could be better? Like, if h is very low, but d is very low as well. But in that case, since DEFY_initial is already >= ATKM, increasing D further would have no effect on dmg_per_round (it's already zero). So buying more D would be a waste. So for D, the maximum we need to check is ATKM.

So for D, possible values are from DEFY_initial to ATKM. If DEFY_initial is already higher than ATKM, then D is just DEFY_initial (since higher D is possible but not needed). So in that case, D can be DEFY_initial, or higher, but higher is unnecessary. So the minimal cost would be to take D as DEFY_initial.

So, the possible D values are in the range [DEFY_initial, max(DEFY_initial, ATKM)].

So, for each possible A in [A_min, A_max], and each possible D in [D_min, D_max], where:

A_min = max(ATKY_initial, DEFM + 1) if ATKY_initial <= DEFM, else ATKY_initial.

Wait, no. A must be >= ATKY_initial. So for example, if initial ATKY is 5 and DEFM is 3, then A can be 5, which is higher than DEFM+1 (4). But if initial ATKY is 3 and DEFM is 3, then A must be at least 4 (DEFM+1) and >= initial ATKY (3). So A_min in that case is 4.

So A_min is the maximum between (DEFM + 1) and ATKY_initial). Because A must be >= ATKY_initial (since you can't buy negative), and must be at least DEFM +1 to deal damage.

But if ATKY_initial is already higher than DEFM +1, then A can start from ATKY_initial.

So A_min = max(ATKY_initial, DEFM + 1).

A_max is DEFM + HPM. Because beyond that, t is 1, so further increases in A don't reduce t, and thus increase cost without benefit.

But what if HPM is very large? Like, say HPM is 1e5. Then DEFM + HPM is 1e5 + DEFM. But given that the input constraints say all numbers in the input are up to 100, so HPM can be at most 100. So DEFM + HPM is at most 100 + 100 = 200. So A_max is 200.

Similarly, for D_max, it's ATKM. Since if D is >= ATKM, then dmg_per_round is zero. So even if the initial DEFY is higher than ATKM, D can stay as initial DEFY.

So for D, the possible values are from D_min = DEFY_initial to D_max = max(DEFY_initial, ATKM). Wait, no. For example, DEFY_initial could be 5, ATKM is 3. Then D can be 5 (so dmg is zero). But D can't be less than 5. Because we can't decrease DEFY. So in this case, D_max is DEFY_initial. Because higher D than that would not improve the situation. So in that case, D can only be DEFY_initial. Because even if you buy more DEF, it's unnecessary. So D_max is the maximum between DEFY_initial and ATKM? No, wait, DEFY_initial could be higher than ATKM, so D can't be lower than DEFY_initial. So in that case, D must be at least DEFY_initial, which is already >= ATKM. So dmg_per_round is zero regardless. So D can be DEFY_initial, and higher values would cost more but no benefit. So the D_max is DEFY_initial in that case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify:

The possible D values are all integers >= DEFY_initial. However, any D >= DEFY_initial and >= ATKM will result in dmg_per_round being zero. So the minimal D that makes dmg_per_round zero is max(DEFY_initial, ATKM). But if DEFY_initial is already >= ATKM, then D can be DEFY_initial. If DEFY_initial is less than ATKM, then D needs to be at least ATKM to make dmg_per_round zero.

But in either case, the possible D values to consider are from DEFY_initial up to max(DEFY_initial, ATKM). Because any D beyond that is unnecessary. For example, if DEFY_initial is 3 and ATKM is 5. Then D can be 5, 6, etc. But for D=5, dmg_per_round is zero. For D=6, same. So buying D beyond 5 (ATKM) is not needed. So the maximum D to check is ATKM. But if DEFY_initial is higher than ATKM, like 6, then D can't be less than 6, so the maximum D to check is 6. But since D must be >= DEFY_initial, the possible D values are from DEFY_initial (6) upwards, but any D >=6 would have dmg_per_round zero (since 6 >= ATKM). So in this case, the minimal D is 6, and higher Ds are possible but not needed.

So for D, the possible values are from DEFY_initial to max(DEFY_initial, ATKM). Because for D >= max(DEFY_initial, ATKM), the dmg_per_round is zero, and any D beyond that doesn't help. So the maximum D we need to check is max(DEFY_initial, ATKM).

Wait, but DEFY_initial could be greater than ATKM. Then the maximum D to check is DEFY_initial, because D can't be lower than that. But in that case, dmg_per_round is zero. So for example, DEFY_initial is 5 and ATKM is 3. Then D must be >=5, which is >=3. So dmg_per_round is zero. So the only D value to check is DEFY_initial. So in this case, the D_max is DEFY_initial.

So the D_max is max(DEFY_initial, ATKM). Because:

If DEFY_initial >= ATKM: D can be DEFY_initial, DEFY_initial +1, etc. But any of those D values >= ATKM, so dmg_per_round is zero. So the minimal D is DEFY_initial. So in this case, the only D to check is DEFY_initial. Because higher D would cost more but not help.

If DEFY_initial < ATKM: then D can range from DEFY_initial up to ATKM. Because once D reaches ATKM, dmg_per_round becomes zero. Any higher D is allowed but not needed.

So the D_max is max(DEFY_initial, ATKM). But for DEFY_initial >= ATKM, the D_max is DEFY_initial (since D can't be lower than DEFY_initial). Wait no: if DEFY_initial is 5 and ATKM is 3, then D must be >=5, so D can be 5,6, etc. But since D >=5 >=3, dmg_per_round is zero. So for D values beyond 5, no benefit. So the maximum D we need to check is DEFY_initial (5) in this case. Because higher Ds are possible, but they don't change anything except cost more.

So the D_max is the maximum between DEFY_initial and ATKM. But wait, if DEFY_initial is 5 and ATKM is 3, then max(DEFY_initial, ATKM) is 5. So D_max is 5. So in this case, D can be 5,6, etc. But those higher Ds (like 6) will cost more but give no benefit. So we can just check D=5, since that's the minimal possible D that makes dmg_per_round zero.

So the conclusion is: for D, the possible values are from DEFY_initial up to max(DEFY_initial, ATKM). Because any D beyond that (if ATKM is higher) would not help.

So for D in the range [DEFY_initial, max(DEFY_initial, ATKM)].

Now, considering the constraints, since all input values are up to 100, the ranges for A and D are manageable.

For example, if DEFM is 100, and HPM is 100, then A_max is 200. So A ranges from max(ATKY_initial, 101) to 200. If ATKY_initial is 150, then A ranges from 150 to 200. So that's 51 possible values for A.

For D, if DEFY_initial is 1 and ATKM is 100, then D ranges from 1 to 100. So 100 possible values.

So the total combinations of A and D are (A_max - A_min +1) * (D_max - D_min +1). For A_max up to 200 and D_max up to 100, the total combinations could be (200-1+1) * (100-1+1) = 200*100 = 20,000. But in practice, the ranges may be smaller. For example, if the initial ATKY is 200, then A_min is 200, A_max is DEFM + HPM. But DEFM + HPM could be 100 + 100 = 200, so A_max is 200. So A would only be 200, so 1 possibility. So the product could be manageable.

Once we have A and D, we compute t as ceil(HPM/(A - DEFM)), then compute the minimal H required. Then calculate the cost for that combination.

So the plan is:

Loop over all possible A (from A_min to A_max)

For each A:

   if A <= DEFM: skip (can't deal damage)

   else:

       loop over all possible D (from DEFY_initial to D_max, which is max(DEFY_initial, ATKM)):

           compute dmg_per_round = max(0, ATKM - D)

           compute t = ceil(HPM / (A - DEFM))

           required_H = t * dmg_per_round + 1

           required_H = max(required_H, initial_HPY)

           cost for H is h * (required_H - initial_HPY)

           cost for A is a * (A - initial_ATKY)

           cost for D is d * (D - initial_DEFY)

           total_cost = cost_A + cost_D + cost_H

           if the combination is valid (required_H > t * dmg_per_round and other conditions), then track the minimal total_cost.

Wait, how do we compute required_H?

H must be >= initial HPY, and H > t * dmg_per_round.

So required_H is the maximum of (initial HPY, t*dmg_per_round +1). Because H needs to be at least initial HPY (since you can't decrease), and also must be > t*dmg_per_round. So required_H is the maximum between initial HPY and (t*dmg_per_round +1).

But (t*dmg_per_round +1) could be larger than initial HPY, or smaller. So required_H is the maximum.

So the required_H is max(initial_HPY, t*dmg_per_round +1).

But then, the cost for H is h*(required_H - initial_HPY).

So for each A and D, compute t, compute required_H, then cost.

Now, the problem is to iterate over all possible A and D in their ranges and compute the minimal cost.

But how do we handle cases where dmg_per_round is zero (D >= ATKM)?

In that case, t*dmg_per_round is zero. So required_H is max(initial_HPY, 1). But since initial_HPY is at least 1 (as per input constraints), required_H is initial_HPY. So cost for H is zero (if initial_HPY is already sufficient). Wait, but the required_H must be >0. So if dmg_per_round is zero, then Yang's HP is H -0 = H. So as long as H >=1. But since H >= initial_HPY (which is >=1), then required_H is initial_HPY. So in that case, the cost for H is zero (if initial_HPY is >=1, which it is). So for example, if D >= ATKM, then required_H is initial_HPY (since H can't be lower than that), and Yang's HP after t rounds is initial_HPY (since no damage is taken). So initial_HPY must be >0. Which it is.

So in that case, required_H is initial_HPY. So cost for H is zero (if initial_HPY is sufficient). But wait, required_H is max(initial_HPY, t*dmg_per_round +1). Since t*dmg_per_round is zero (D >= ATKM), required_H is max(initial_HPY, 1). So if initial_HPY is 1, then required_H is 1, but after t rounds, Yang's HP is 1 -0 =1>0. So valid.

So for D >= ATKM, required_H is initial_HPY, as long as initial_HPY >=1. Which it is, since input constraints say all numbers are >=1.

So the code can proceed as follows.

Now, the key steps are:

1. Iterate over all possible A in A_min to A_max (A_max = DEFM + HPM)
   But since HPM can be up to 100, and DEFM up to 100, A_max can be up to 200.

   So for A in range(A_min, A_max +1):

       if A <= DEFM: skip (since can't deal damage)
       else:
           t = ceil(HPM / (A - DEFM))
           iterate D in D_min to D_max:
               D_min = DEFY_initial
               D_max = max(DEFY_initial, ATKM)
               for D in range(D_min, D_max +1):
                   dmg_per_round = max(0, ATKM - D)
                   required_H = max(HPY_initial, t*dmg_per_round + 1)
                   cost_H = (required_H - HPY_initial) * h
                   cost_A = (A - ATKY_initial) * a
                   cost_D = (D - DEFY_initial) * d
                   total = cost_A + cost_D + cost_H
                   if this total is minimal, update the minimal cost.

But wait, the required_H must be >= HPY_initial. So required_H is max(HPY_initial, t*dmg_per_round +1). So even if t*dmg_per_round +1 is less than HPY_initial, required_H is HPY_initial. Which means Yang doesn't buy any HP. So in that case, his HP is HPY_initial. But then, after t rounds, his HP is HPY_initial - t*dmg_per_round. Which must be >0.

Wait, required_H is the HP after purchasing, which is required to be >= HPY_initial. So required_H = max(HPY_initial, t*dmg_per_round +1). Then, Yang's HP in battle is required_H. After t rounds, his HP is required_H - t*dmg_per_round. Which must be >0.

But required_H >= t*dmg_per_round +1. So required_H - t*dmg_per_round >=1. So it's valid.

But how to compute required_H correctly.

Yes. So required_H is the maximum between HPY_initial and (t*dmg_per_round +1). Because:

- If HPY_initial is >= t*dmg_per_round +1 → required_H is HPY_initial. Then after purchasing, his HP is HPY_initial. So after t rounds, HP is HPY_initial - t*dmg_per_round. Since required_H is >= t*dmg_per_round +1, then HPY_initial - t*dmg_per_round >=1. So valid.

- If HPY_initial < t*dmg_per_round +1 → required_H is t*dmg_per_round +1. So after purchasing, his HP is t*dmg_per_round +1. Then after t rounds: (t*dmg_per_round +1) - t*dmg_per_round =1 >0. Valid.

So this approach ensures that required_H is sufficient.

So for each A and D, compute required_H as max(HPY_initial, t*dmg_per_round +1), then calculate the cost.

Now, the problem is to find the minimal total cost across all possible A and D.

Now, let's think about edge cases.

Example 1:

Input:

1 2 1

1 100 1

1 100 100

So initial HPY is 1, ATKY is 2, DEFY is1.

Monster's HPM=1, ATKM=100, DEFM=1.

Prices h=1, a=100, d=100.

Sample output is 99.

In this case, the optimal is to buy 99 HP, so his HP becomes 1+99=100. His ATKY is 2, which is > DEFM (1). So dmg_to_monster is 2-1=1. So t = ceil(1/1) =1.

Then, dmg_per_round is 100 - DEFY (which was 1, but since he didn't buy any DEF, it's 1). So dmg_per_round is 99. So required_H is max(1, 1*99 +1) → max(1,100) →100. So cost_H is 99*1=99. ATKY is 2 (initial 2, no cost). DEFY is 1 (no cost). So total cost is 99.

Which matches the sample.

Another example:

Input:

100 100 100

1 1 1

1 1 1

He can win without buying anything. So output is 0.

So the code must check if the initial values are sufficient.

So the code must first check if, with initial values, the battle is already a win. If yes, then output 0.

So, first step is to check whether the initial values are sufficient.

How to check that:

Compute initial A (ATKY_initial), D (DEFY_initial), H (HPY_initial).

Check if A <= DEFM: if yes, then he can't deal damage. So he can't win. So he must buy ATK.

If A > DEFM:

Compute t = ceil(HPM/(A - DEFM))

Compute dmg_per_round = max(0, ATKM - D)

Check if H_initial - t*dmg_per_round >0.

If yes, then initial values are sufficient. So cost is 0.

So, before proceeding to iterate over A and D, we can first check this. If yes, return 0.

Otherwise, proceed.

So this is an important optimization. Because if initial values are sufficient, then output is 0.

So code steps:

Check if initial A > DEFM. If not, proceed to loop.

If initial A > DEFM:

   compute t_initial = ceil(HPM/(ATKY_initial - DEFM))

   compute dmg_per_round_initial = max(0, ATKM - DEFY_initial)

   if (HPY_initial - t_initial * dmg_per_round_initial) >0 → output 0.

Else, proceed.

So this is the first check.

In the second sample input, initial ATKY is 100, DEFM is1. So A is 100>1. t_initial = ceil(1/(100-1))=1. dmg_per_round_initial is max(0, 1-100) →0. So required_H is max(100, 0*1 +1) →100. So H_initial is 100. After 1 round, his HP is 100-0=100>0. So the initial values are sufficient. So output is 0.

So this check is essential.

So in code:

First check if initial ATKY > DEFM. If not, then proceed. Else:

t_initial = math.ceil(HPM / (ATKY_initial - DEFM))

dmg_initial = max(0, ATKM - DEFY_initial)

if HPY_initial > t_initial * dmg_initial:

   return 0

else:

   proceed with the loops.

So this is an important step to save computation.

Now, the code structure:

Read HPY, ATKY, DEFY.

Read HPM, ATKM, DEFM.

Read h, a, d.

Check if initial values can win:

if ATKY > DEFM:

   t_initial = ceil(HPM / (ATKY - DEFM))

   dmg_initial = max(0, ATKM - DEFY)

   if HPY > t_initial * dmg_initial:

       print(0)

       exit()

So else, proceed.

Then, iterate over possible A and D.

Compute A_min = max(ATKY, DEFM +1) if ATKY <= DEFM. Wait, no.

Wait, A_min is the maximum between ATKY and DEFM +1. Because:

If ATKY is already >= DEFM +1 → A_min is ATKY.

If ATKY is < DEFM +1 → then A must be >= DEFM +1. So A_min is DEFM+1, but since we can't buy negative, so A must be at least ATKY. So if ATKY < DEFM+1 → A_min is DEFM+1 (since ATKY can't be increased to less than DEFM +1, but must be at least DEFM +1).

So A_min = max(ATKY, DEFM +1) if ATKY <= DEFM.

Wait, no. If ATKY is already > DEFM, then A can be ATKY, which is higher than DEFM +1. For example, ATKY is 5, DEFM is 3 → DEFM +1 is 4. So A_min is 5 (since ATKY is already higher than DEFM +1). So A_min is max(ATKY, DEFM +1).

Yes.

So code:

A_min = max(ATKY, DEFM + 1)

A_max = DEFM + HPM

Because when A is DEFM + HPM, t is 1 (since (DEFM + HPM - DEFM) = HPM → t=1). Any higher A would still give t=1.

But if HPM is zero? But according to the input constraints, HPM is at least 1. So no problem.

Now, for A in range(A_min, A_max +1):

   (since A can be up to A_max, inclusive)

But since HPM can be up to 100, DEFM can be up to 100, A_max can be up to 200.

For each A in A_min to A_max:

   if A <= DEFM → skip (can't deal damage). But since A_min is set to max(ATKY, DEFM+1), this condition is only possible if ATKY < DEFM+1 and A is in the range.

Wait, no. Because A_min is set to max(ATKY, DEFM+1). For example, if ATKY is 3, DEFM is 3. Then DEFM+1 is 4. So A_min is 4. So A starts from 4. So A is 4,5,... up to DEFM + HPM. So all A in that range are >= DEFM+1, which is > DEFM. So no need to check for A <= DEFM. So this check is redundant. So we can skip it.

So code can proceed as:

for A in range(A_min, A_max + 1):

   t = math.ceil(HPM / (A - DEFM))

   for D in range(D_min, D_max +1):

       D_min is DEFY_initial.

       D_max is max(DEFY_initial, ATKM).

       for D in D_range:

           dmg_per_round = max(0, ATKM - D)

           required_H = max(HPY, t * dmg_per_round +1)

           cost_H = h * (required_H - HPY)

           cost_A = a * (A - ATKY)

           cost_D = d * (D - DEFY)

           total = cost_H + cost_A + cost_D

           keep track of the minimal total.

But we can loop D from DEFY to max(DEFY, ATKM). Because any D beyond that would not reduce damage.

Now, code can be written as:

D_min = DEFY

D_max = max(DEFY, ATKM)

for D in range(D_min, D_max + 1):

   ...

So for each A and D in their ranges.

Now, the code must compute t for each A.

But what if A - DEFM is zero? But A is >= DEFM +1, so A - DEFM >=1. So division is safe.

So in code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
import math


def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    HPY, ATKY, DEFY = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    HPM, ATKM, DEFM = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    h, a, d = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())

    # Check if initial is sufficient

    if ATKY > DEFM:

        t_initial = (HPM + (ATKY - DEFM) - 1) // (ATKY - DEFM)  # ceil division

        dmg_initial = max(0, ATKM - DEFY)

        if HPY > t_initial * dmg_initial:

            print(0, file=output_stream)

            return

    # Now proceed to find minimal cost

    min_cost = float('inf')

    A_min = max(ATKY, DEFM + 1)

    A_max = DEFM + HPM

    D_min = DEFY

    D_max = max(DEFY, ATKM)

    for A in range(A_min, A_max + 1):

        delta_A = A - ATKY

        cost_A = delta_A * a

        if cost_A >= min_cost:  # pruning: if already cost_A exceeds current min, skip

            continue

        t = (HPM + (A - DEFM) - 1) // (A - DEFM)  # ceil division

        for D in range(D_min, D_max +1):

            delta_D = D - DEFY

            cost_D = delta_D * d

            if cost_A + cost_D >= min_cost:

                continue  # pruning

            dmg_per_round = max(0, ATKM - D)

            required_H = max(HPY, t * dmg_per_round + 1)

            cost_H = (required_H - HPY) * h

            total = cost_A + cost_D + cost_H

            if total < min_cost:

                min_cost = total

    print(min_cost, file=output_stream)

Another example: sample input 2, which returns 0. The code would check the initial condition and print 0.

Now, what about a case where initial ATKY is sufficient but HP is not enough.

For example:

HPY=5, ATKY=10, DEFY=5.

HPM=10, DEFM=5.

ATKM=10.

So initial A=10 > DEFM=5.

t_initial = ceil(10/(10-5)) =2.

dmg_initial = max(0,10-5)=5.

HPY_initial (5) > 2*5 →5>10? No. So 5>10 is false. So initial values are not sufficient. So code proceeds.

A_min = max(10, 5+1)=10.

A_max=5+10=15.

For A=10:

t=ceil(10/(5))=2.

Loop D from DEFY=5 to max(5,10)=10.

For D=5:

dmg_per_round=10-5=5. required_H = max(5, 2*5+1)=max(5,11) →11. cost_H=6*h.

cost_A=0 (since A=10 is initial). cost_D=0 (since D=5 is initial).

total=6*h.

If h is 1, cost is 6.

If we can buy more DEF to reduce dmg_per_round.

For example, D=10:

dmg_per_round=0. required_H =max(5, 0+1) →5. cost_H=0. cost_D= (10-5)*d. If d is 1, cost is 5. So total is 5.

Which is better than 6.

So code would find this.

Thus, the code should correctly compute the minimal cost.

Now, the code as written should handle all cases correctly.

But in Python, we have to be careful with the loops and ranges.

Now, possible issues:

1. When A_min is larger than A_max. For example, DEFM + HPM is 100, but A_min is 200. So the loop would not run.

But in such a case, it's impossible. But how can that happen?

For example, if initial ATKY is 200, and DEFM + HPM is 100. But then A_min is max(200, 101) →200. A_max is 100. So loop from 200 to 100 → which is not possible. So the loop would not run, leading to min_cost remaining as infinity. Which would be a problem.

But this scenario is impossible. Because DEFM + HPM is the sum of two numbers up to 100 each, so up to 200. So A_max is DEFM + HPM. If initial ATKY is 200, then DEFM + HPM must be >=200, otherwise initial ATKY is 200, but DEFM + HPM could be, say, 150. Then A_min is max(200, DEFM +1). But DEFM could be 100. Then DEFM +1 is 101. So A_min is 200. A_max is 100 + HPM (HPM can be up to 100). For example, DEFM is 100, HPM is 100. So A_max is 200. So loop runs from 200 to 200.

But if initial ATKY is 201, and DEFM is 100, HPM is 100. Then A_min is max(201, 101) →201. A_max is 200. So the loop doesn't run. So in this case, no possible A can be >=201 and <=200. So code returns min_cost as infinity. But this is impossible.

So how can this scenario arise?

It would happen when DEFM + HPM < A_min. Which implies that even if Yang buys the maximum possible A (DEFM + HPM), which is needed to have t=1, but A_min is higher than that. So no possible A can be found. So the battle is impossible to win. But according to the problem statement, is it possible to have such a case?

Wait, the problem says that Master Yang can buy any attributes. So if DEFM + HPM < A_min (A_min is max(ATKY_initial, DEFM+1)), then it's impossible to have A >= A_min and <= DEFM + HPM. So no possible A exists. So in this case, the code would not find any solution, leading to min_cost being infinity. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that there exists a solution.

But the problem says that Master Yang wants to know the minimal bitcoins to spend. So the input must allow for some solution.

But perhaps in some cases, even with buying attributes, it's impossible. For example, initial ATKY is 1, DEFM is 100. So A_min is DEFM+1=101. A_max is DEFM + HPM (say, 100 + 1 =101). So A can be 101. So possible.

But if HPM is 100, DEFM is 100, then A_max is 200. So A_min is max(initial ATKY (say 1), DEFM+1=101) →101. So loop runs from 101 to 200.

So the code would iterate possible A values.

But what if initial ATKY is 200, DEFM is 100, HPM is 99. Then DEFM + HPM is 199. A_min is max(200, 101) →200. A_max is 199. So loop from 200 to 199 → no iterations. So code returns infinity. But this would be a case where Yang's initial ATKY is 200 (which is higher than DEFM+1=101). So he can deal damage. But according to the initial check:

if initial ATKY (200) > DEFM (100):

   t_initial = ceil(99/(200-100))=1.

   dmg_initial = max(0, ATKM - DEFY_initial).

   if HPY_initial > t_initial * dmg_initial → yes, then output 0.

So the code would have exited early, and not entered the loop.

So the case where A_min > A_max would only happen if the initial ATKY is sufficient. Otherwise, the code would have to proceed.

But in the code, after checking the initial case, we proceed to the loop. But if the code is only entered when initial case is not sufficient, then the loop may not run (if A_min > A_max). But that can't happen because in that case, the initial ATKY would have to be <= DEFM, which would have made the initial check fail.

Wait, no. The initial check is only for when initial ATKY > DEFM.

So if initial ATKY is <= DEFM, then the code proceeds to the loop.

In that case, A_min is max(initial ATKY, DEFM+1) → DEFM+1.

But if DEFM + HPM < DEFM+1 → which is possible if HPM=0. But according to input constraints, HPM is at least 1.

So DEFM + HPM >= DEFM +1. So A_min is DEFM+1, A_max is DEFM + HPM.

So for example, DEFM is 100, HPM is 1. Then A_max is 101. A_min is 101 (DEFM +1). So loop runs from 101 to 101. So possible.

Thus, the code will always have valid A and D ranges.

Therefore, the code should handle all possible cases correctly.

Now, code implementation.

Potential edge cases:

- When DEFM is higher than initial ATKY, and Yang has to buy ATK to reach DEFM +1.

- When D needs to be increased to ATKM to reduce dmg_per_round to zero.

But the code should handle these cases.

Another edge case: when the required_H is initial_HPY. For example, initial_HPY is 100, t*dmg_per_round is 99. Then required_H is max(100, 99+1=100) →100. So cost_H is 0.

Another case: HPM is exactly divisible by (A - DEFM). For example, HPM=10, A - DEFM=5. Then t=2.

But code uses ceil, so (10 +5-1)//5 →14//5=2. Which is correct.

So the code is correct.

Now, let's implement the code as discussed.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of bitcoins Master Yang must spend to ensure he can defeat the monster in Cyberland. The solution involves optimizing the attributes of HP, ATK, and DEF such that the battle conditions are met with minimal cost.

### Approach
1. **Initial Check**: First, check if Master Yang's initial attributes are sufficient to defeat the monster without any purchases. If so, the cost is 0.
2. **Attribute Ranges**: Determine the feasible ranges for ATK (A) and DEF (D) that Master Yang can buy:
   - **ATK (A)**: Must be high enough to deal damage to the monster, starting from `max(initial ATK, DEF of monster + 1)` up to `DEF of monster + HP of monster`.
   - **DEF (D)**: Must be sufficient to reduce the damage taken from the monster, starting from the initial DEF up to the monster's ATK.
3. **Cost Calculation**: For each combination of A and D within their respective ranges, compute the required HP to survive the battle and the total cost. Track the minimum cost encountered.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

# Read input
HPY, ATKY, DEFY = map(int, input().split())
HPM, ATKM, DEFM = map(int, input().split())
h, a, d = map(int, input().split())

# Check if initial configuration is sufficient
if ATKY > DEFM:
    t_initial = (HPM + (ATKY - DEFM) - 1) // (ATKY - DEFM)
    dmg_initial = max(0, ATKM - DEFY)
    if HPY > t_initial * dmg_initial:
        print(0)
        exit()

min_cost = float('inf')

A_min = max(ATKY, DEFM + 1)
A_max = DEFM + HPM

D_min = DEFY
D_max = max(DEFY, ATKM)

for A in range(A_min, A_max + 1):
    delta_A = A - ATKY
    cost_A = delta_A * a
    if cost_A >= min_cost:
        continue  # Prune if cost_A already exceeds current minimum
    
    delta_attack = A - DEFM
    t = (HPM + delta_attack - 1) // delta_attack  # ceil division
    
    for D in range(D_min, D_max + 1):
        delta_D = D - DEFY
        cost_D = delta_D * d
        if cost_A + cost_D >= min_cost:
            continue  # Prune if current costs exceed minimum
        
        dmg_per_round = max(0, ATKM - D)
        required_H = max(HPY, t * dmg_per_round + 1)
        cost_H = (required_H - HPY) * h
        
        total_cost = cost_A + cost_D + cost_H
        if total_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = total_cost

print(min_cost)
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Check**: The code first checks if Master Yang's initial attributes are sufficient to win the battle without any purchases. If so, it immediately outputs 0.
2. **Range Determination**: The feasible ranges for ATK and DEF are determined based on the problem constraints to ensure that Master Yang can deal damage and reduce incoming damage effectively.
3. **Cost Calculation**: For each combination of ATK and DEF within their ranges, the code calculates the required HP to survive the battle duration and computes the total cost. The minimum cost is tracked and updated throughout the iterations.

This approach efficiently explores all feasible attribute combinations while pruning unnecessary calculations to ensure optimal performance within the given constraints.
