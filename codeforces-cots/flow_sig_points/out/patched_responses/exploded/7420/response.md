Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find out how many distinct maximum possible numbers with as many 9s as possible Inna can get by merging adjacent pairs that sum to 9. And the input can be up to 1e100000 digits long, which is way too big for any brute force approach. So we need an efficient way to compute this.

First, let's understand the problem. Each time, Inna can replace two adjacent digits that sum to 9 with a 9. The goal is to maximize the number of 9s. But the way you merge can affect subsequent merges. For example, merging earlier pairs might block later pairs that could lead to more 9s. So the key is to find all possible ways to merge non-overlapping pairs that sum to 9 in such a way that the total number of 9s is maximized. Then, among all those possibilities, count how many distinct final numbers there are.

Hmm. Wait, but the problem states that Inna wants to get the maximum number of 9s possible. So first, we need to determine the maximum possible count of 9s that can be obtained. Then, count the number of distinct ways to reach that maximum.

So the approach could be:

1. Find the maximum possible number of 9s that can be formed through the optimal merging steps.
2. Then, calculate how many distinct sequences of merges lead to this maximum, considering that different merge orders may result in the same final number, but some might lead to different numbers even if the count of 9s is the same.

But how do we model this? The problem seems similar to dynamic programming, where we track possible states and their counts.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a greedy approach, but with some variations where choices can be made. But the key is that overlapping pairs can't be merged, so the order of merging affects the possibilities.

Wait, but merging two digits into 9 creates a new digit, which can then form a new pair with adjacent digits. For example, merging two digits into 9 might allow the new 9 to be adjacent to another digit, say 0 (but in our problem, there are no zeros). Wait, the input digits are from 1 to 9, so the merged 9 can form pairs with other digits. But since 9 can only pair with a digit that sums to 9, which is 0, but since there are no zeros, the 9s created can't be merged further. So once you create a 9, it's a single digit and can't be part of any further mergings. So the merging process is such that each merge step replaces two digits with a 9, but once that's done, those two digits are gone, replaced by a 9. So the merging process can't create new pairs that sum to 9, except in the case where merging two adjacent digits creates a new 9 that is adjacent to another 9. Wait, but 9+9 is 18, which is not 9. So the merged 9s can't form new pairs. Therefore, the merging process can be done in any order where pairs that sum to 9 are merged, and once merged, they can't contribute to any further pairs. So the problem reduces to selecting a set of non-overlapping pairs (each summing to 9) such that merging them into 9s gives the maximum possible count. However, the order of merging might affect which pairs are available. For instance, merging a pair early might block another pair from being merged.

Wait, but how? Let's take an example. Suppose we have a sequence like 1 8 1 8. The possible pairs are (1,8) at positions 0-1 and 2-3. But if we merge the first pair (0-1) into 9, then the new array becomes 9,1,8. Now, the 1 and 8 can be merged into 9. So that's two merges, leading to two 9s. Alternatively, if we merge the second pair (2-3) first, the original array becomes 1,8,9, and then the first two can't be merged (1+8=9, so we can merge again. So in this case, regardless of the order, two 9s are possible. So merging either pair first allows the other to be merged. So the order doesn't affect the maximum possible count. So in this example, the maximum is two 9s, and the order of merging doesn't affect that.

Another example: 3 6 9 7 2 7. Let's see. The original pairs that sum to 9 are 3+6, 7+2. So merging 3+6 first gives 9, then 7+2 becomes 9. So two 9s. But if the original sequence had overlapping pairs, like 1 8 8 1. Then the possible pairs are (1,8) at 0-1 and (8,1) at 2-3. These are overlapping pairs, so merging one would prevent merging the other. So the maximum possible is one 9. But merging either pair would result in a 9 in different positions, leading to different sequences, but the count is the same.

But the problem is not just the count of 9s, but also the distinct numbers. So in the first example (369727), the two possible ways to merge lead to different numbers. So the maximum count of 9s is 3, and there are two distinct ways to reach it.

So the core idea is to model the merging process in a way that selects pairs that sum to 9, in such a way that the maximum possible 9s are created, and then count the distinct numbers that can result from these choices.

But how do we model this efficiently for very large numbers (up to 1e5 digits)?

This seems challenging. Let's think of possible approaches.

First, the key observation: the merging process can be represented as a set of non-overlapping intervals, each of which sums to 9, and the intervals are non-overlapping and not adjacent (since after merging two digits into 9, they are replaced by a single 9, which cannot be part of any new pairs). Wait, but when two digits are merged into a 9, the new 9 is adjacent to the next digit. Wait, for example: if the original digits are a, b, c, d, e. If we merge (b,c) into 9, the new digits are a,9, d, e. So 9 is adjacent to a and d. But since the sum of a and 9 is a+9 (unless a is 0, which it's not), so no new pairs can be formed. So merging a pair into 9 doesn't create new possible pairs. Therefore, the merging process is such that each merge step must be of two adjacent digits that sum to 9, and after merging, the new 9 cannot form a new pair with its neighbors.

Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting a maximum set of non-overlapping pairs (each summing to 9), and then the order of merging these pairs does not affect the final outcome. Wait, but merging pairs that are not overlapping can be done in any order, but overlapping pairs can't be merged. So the maximum number of 9s is determined by the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs that sum to 9. But wait, overlapping pairs can't be merged, but perhaps merging some pairs allows for more pairs to be merged.

Wait, in the example 1818, merging the first two (1 and 8) gives 9, and the next two 8 and 1. But in this case, after merging the first pair, the next pair is not adjacent. So merging first pair gives 9, then 8 and 1 are next, which can't form a pair. So in this case, the maximum is 1. But the original pairs are (1,8) and (8,1), which are overlapping. So merging one prevents merging the other. So the maximum is one 9. But if we merged the second pair first, same result.

Another example: 36363. The pairs are 3+6=9 (positions 0-1 and 2-3). These are non-overlapping. So merging both would give two 9s. But after merging positions 0-1 into 9, then positions 1-2 are 9 and 3. So the next possible pair is 3 and 6 (positions 3-4, which are 6 and 3, sum to 9). So merging these would give another 9. So total two 9s.

Wait, but the original pairs are (0-1), (2-3), (3-4). Wait, 3+6 is 9, then 6+3 is 9. So in the original number 36363, the digits are 3,6,3,6,3. So possible pairs are (0-1), (2-3), (3-4). If we merge (0-1), the number becomes 9,3,6,3. Then merging (2-3) gives 9,3,9. So total two 9s. Or merge (2-3) first: 3,6,9,3. Then merge (0-1): 9,9,3. So two 9s. Alternatively, merge (3-4) first: 3,6,3,9. Then merge (0-1) gives 9,3,9. So again two 9s. So the maximum is two.

So in this case, the maximum is determined by the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs that can be selected. So the problem is equivalent to finding the maximum possible number of non-overlapping pairs in the original number that sum to 9, such that when merged, they produce the maximum number of 9s. Then, the distinct ways to merge those pairs (when there are multiple choices) would determine the count of distinct numbers.

But wait, the problem statement says that Inna can choose the order of merging, which may lead to different final numbers even if the same pairs are merged. For example, in the first sample input:

369727 → possible merges:

Original digits: 3 6 9 7 2 7.

Possible pairs that sum to 9: 3+6, 7+2.

So merging 3+6 first: becomes 9 9 7 7. Then merging 9 and 7 (sum 16, no) and 7+7 (14, no). Wait, but wait, after merging 3+6 into 9, the next digits are 9,7,2,7. Then 7+2 sum to 9, so merging those gives 9,9,7. Then merging 9 and 7 (sum 16, no) and 7 is left. So the final number is 9997. Alternatively, merging 7+2 first (original digits 3 6 9 7 2 7), then merging 7+2 gives 3 6 9 9 7. Then merging 3+6 gives 9 9 9 7. So same as before. Wait, but according to the first example's note, there are two distinct final numbers: 9997 and 9979. So how does that happen?

Ah, perhaps I'm missing some pairs. Let's look at the first sample:

Original input is 369727.

Digits: 3 6 9 7 2 7.

Possible initial pairs are 3+6 (sum 9), 7+2 (sum 9). But in the note, the steps are 369727 → 99727 (so merging 3+6 and 9 (from 9, which is already a 9?), wait no. Wait, the first step in the note is 369727 → 99727. So merging 3 and 6 (sum 9), replacing them with 9. So the digits become 9,9,7,2,7. Then in the next step, they can merge 9 and 7+2=9? Wait, 7+2=9, so merging those gives 9,9,9,7. Then merging 9 and 9 (sum 18) can't. So that's 9997. Alternatively, in the first step, merge 7+2 first (original digits 3,6,9,7,2,7 → merge 7+2 (sum 9) into 9: digits become 3,6,9,9,7. Then merge 3+6 (sum 9) into 9: digits are 9,9,9,7. Which is the same as before. But according to the note, there are two possibilities. Oh, wait, perhaps there's another way. Let me check the note again.

In the first sample, the steps are:

14545181 → 1945181 → 194519 → 19919.

But the note says that in the first sample, Inna can get two different numbers. How?

Ah, the example in the note is different. Let's focus on the first sample input given, which is 369727. The output is 2. The note says that the two possible paths are:

369727 → 99727 → 9997 (two merges: 3+6 and 7+2, leading to 9997).

369727 → 99727 → 9979 (how? So after merging 3+6 into 9, the digits are 9,9,7,2,7. Then, perhaps the next merge is 2+7=9. Wait, but 2+7 is 9. So merging 2 and 7 would give 9,9,7,9. So the number is 9979. Oh right! Because after merging 3+6, the digits are 9,9,7,2,7. Then, there are two possible merges: 7+2=9 (sum 9) and 2+7=9 (sum 9). Wait, but those are overlapping. Wait, 7 and 2 are adjacent (positions 2 and 3), sum to 9. Then 2 and 7 (positions 3 and 4) sum to 9. So merging either pair. So merging 7+2 would replace them with 9, giving digits 9,9,9,7. Which is 9997. Merging 2+7 would replace them with 9, giving digits 9,9,7,9. Which is 9979. So two different possibilities.

Ah, so the order in which the merges are done can affect the outcome. So in this case, after merging 3+6 first, there are two possible pairs (7+2 and 2+7) that can be merged next. But those pairs are overlapping. So merging one blocks the other. Therefore, the maximum number of 9s here is three. The two options are to merge 7+2 or 2+7 next, leading to two different numbers. So the count is 2.

So, the key insight is that when you have overlapping pairs that can be merged, the choice of which pair to merge can lead to different final numbers. But how do we model this efficiently?

This suggests that the problem isn't just about selecting a maximum set of non-overlapping pairs, but also considering the order in which overlapping pairs are merged. However, given that the input can be up to 1e5 digits, we need a way to model this in linear or linearithmic time.

Another approach: perhaps the maximum number of 9s is determined by the maximum possible number of non-overlapping pairs, but some of these pairs can be merged in different orders, leading to different final numbers. However, overlapping pairs (like the 7+2 and 2+7 in the example) can be merged in different orders, leading to different outcomes. Therefore, when such a situation occurs, the number of distinct possibilities multiplies.

Wait, but how do we track overlapping possibilities?

Perhaps, the problem can be modeled as a dynamic programming problem, where we track possible states of the current position and the possible ways to merge up to that point.

Let me think. For each position in the original string, we can track two things: the maximum number of 9s achievable up to that position, and the number of distinct ways to reach that maximum. The transitions would depend on whether we merge a pair at the current position or not.

But since the pairs are two digits, the DP state needs to consider whether the previous digit was part of a merged pair or not.

So, for each index i in the string, we can have:

- dp[i] = (max_count, ways)

Where max_count is the maximum number of 9s up to index i, and ways is the number of distinct ways to achieve that max_count.

Then, for each position i, we can consider two cases:

1. Do not merge the current digit (s[i]) with the previous digit (s[i-1]). In this case, the max_count and ways are carried over from dp[i-1].

2. If s[i] + s[i-1] == 9, then we can merge them. In this case, the max_count is the dp[i-2].max_count + 1. The ways would be dp[i-2].ways.

But wait, this is similar to the classic DP approach for maximum independent set, where choosing a pair adds 1 to the count, and the ways multiply accordingly. However, when merging, we need to ensure that the previous digits are not part of another merge.

But the problem is that after merging two digits, they are replaced by a 9. So the merging affects the subsequent digits. However, since the merged 9 cannot form a new pair with adjacent digits (since 9 can only pair with 0, which is not present), the merging of a pair at i-1 and i allows us to then proceed to i+1, but the merged 9 is now part of the new array. However, the DP approach here is in the original string. So perhaps the DP approach models the original string's possible merges, considering that merging a pair at i-1 and i would take those two digits into a 9, and then the next step can't merge i-2 with i-1 (since they are already merged).

Alternatively, perhaps the DP can be based on the original string, considering that merging a pair at positions i-1 and i implies that the next merge must start from i+1. So when we merge positions i-1 and i, we can't merge positions i and i+1.

So the DP transitions would be:

For position i:

- If we don't merge i with i-1, then the max_count is the same as up to i-1, and ways is the same as up to i-1.

- If we can merge i with i-1 (sum to 9), then the max_count is dp[i-2].max_count + 1, and the ways is dp[i-2].ways.

But wait, merging i-1 and i would require that those digits haven't been merged before. So the DP would track the maximum possible merges up to i, considering whether the previous digit was part of a merge or not.

Hmm, perhaps the state should include whether the previous digit is part of a merged pair. For example, the state could be:

dp[i][0] = (max_count, ways) where the digit at i is not merged.

dp[i][1] = (max_count, ways) where the digit at i is merged with i-1.

But given the size of the input (1e5 digits), a 2D DP array might be manageable, as each state is O(1).

Alternatively, since for each position i, the DP only depends on i-1 and i-2, we can use variables to track the previous states.

Let me think. Let's model the DP as follows:

For each position i (starting from 0), the maximum number of 9s up to i, and the number of ways to achieve that maximum.

At each step i, we can decide to merge i-1 and i (if they sum to 9) or not.

The DP recurrence:

If merging i-1 and i is possible (sum to 9):

Then, the maximum count would be the maximum between:

- Not merging (max_count[i-1])

- Merging (max_count[i-2] + 1)

If the maximum count from merging is higher, then the ways are the sum of the ways from the cases that contribute to the maximum.

Wait, this is similar to the classic maximum subarray problem with counting the number of ways.

Let's formalize this:

Initialize a DP array where dp[i] = (max_count, num_ways).

Base cases:

dp[0] = (0, 1) (since there's one way to have zero merges for the first digit).

dp[1] will check if the first two digits sum to 9. If yes, then (1, 1). Otherwise, (0, 1).

For i >= 2:

If the current digit and the previous digit sum to 9, then:

option1 = dp[i-2].max_count + 1 (merging i-1 and i)

option2 = dp[i-1].max_count (not merging i-1 and i)

if option1 > option2:

then dp[i].max_count = option1, and dp[i].num_ways = dp[i-2].num_ways

elif option2 > option1:

dp[i] = (option2, dp[i-1].num_ways)

else:

dp[i] = (option1, dp[i-2].num_ways + dp[i-1].num_ways)

Wait, but this approach doesn't consider overlapping merges that could lead to different sequences. For example, in the first sample, merging 3+6 and then 7+2 gives 9997, whereas merging 3+6 and then 2+7 gives 9979. But according to the DP approach above, when considering the pair 7 and 2 (positions 3-4 in the original string), merging them would add 1 to the count and the ways would be the ways from up to position 2 (which is 9, after merging 3+6). Then, the next pair (positions 4-5) would be 2+7. But according to the DP approach, merging those would be considered as separate options.

Wait, perhaps the DP approach is not sufficient to capture these cases because when merging a pair in the middle, the remaining digits are altered, which could create new pairs. But according to earlier analysis, merging a pair creates a 9, which cannot form new pairs. Therefore, after merging a pair, the remaining digits are processed as a new string. However, in the DP approach, we are processing the original string, and the merging of pairs in the original string.

Wait, this is a key point. When we merge a pair, the merged 9 replaces the two digits, which may affect the possible pairs in the subsequent digits. However, the DP approach is considering the original string and the possible merges in a way that allows non-overlapping pairs. But in reality, merging a pair in the original string may allow a new pair that was not present in the original string. For example, suppose we have 1818. The original pairs are (0,1) and (2,3). But if we merge (0,1), the new string is 9,8,1. Then, merging (1,2) (digits 8 and 1) is not possible. But in the original string, (1,2) would be 8 and 1, which sum to 9. Wait, but the original string's (1,2) is 8 and 1. So when processing the original string, the DP approach would consider merging (0,1), but after that, the next digits are 8 and 1 (positions 1 and 2 in the original string). However, in the original string, those two digits are 8 and 1, which sum to 9. So the DP approach would allow merging (1,2) as a possible pair. But in reality, after merging (0,1), the digits are 9,8,1. So the 8 and 1 are adjacent, but in the original string, they are positions 1 and 2. So merging them would require that those positions are part of the original string, which they are. But after merging (0,1) and then (1,2), these are overlapping pairs in the original string. So the DP approach would allow merging them, but in reality, this is impossible because merging (0,1) and (1,2) would be overlapping.

Wait, this is a problem. The DP approach as described would allow merging overlapping pairs in the original string, which is invalid. So the DP approach is not correct.

This means that the DP approach outlined earlier is incorrect because it allows merging pairs in the original string that are overlapping. So the initial model is wrong.

So what's the correct way to model this?

The problem is that merging two adjacent digits in the original string can create a new 9, which might form a new pair with a digit that was not adjacent in the original string. For example, merging (i, i+1) into 9, then the next digits are i-1's 9 and i+2's digit. But if those sum to 9, then merging them would not be possible in the original model. So the DP approach that only considers the original string's pairs is insufficient.

Therefore, the merging steps can create new pairs that weren't present in the original string. For example, let's take the string 1 8 8 1. The original pairs are (0,1) and (2,3), each summing to 9. If you merge (0,1), you get 9,8,1. Then, the next possible pair is (1,2) (8+1=9). So merging those gives 9,9. So total two 9s. But in the original string, merging (0,1) and (1,2) (positions 0-1 and 1-2) would be overlapping in the original string, but after merging the first pair, the next pair is allowed. However, the DP approach that only considers the original string's pairs would not allow merging (1,2) because those are adjacent in the original string and overlapping with the previous merge.

So this suggests that the merging process can create new pairs that are not present in the original string. Hence, the initial approach of finding non-overlapping pairs in the original string is not sufficient. Therefore, the problem is more complex than initially thought.

But how can we model this for very large strings?

Alternative approach: think of the merging steps as a series of replacements that can create new pairs. Each time a merge happens, it replaces two digits with a 9, and then new pairs can be formed between the new 9 and neighboring digits.

But since the new 9 can't form a pair with any other digit (as digits are 1-9, and 9+anything except 0 is not 9), any new pairs formed must have been present in the original string. Wait, but after merging two digits into 9, the 9 could be adjacent to a digit that was not adjacent before.

For example, consider the string 1 8 8 1. After merging (0,1) into 9, the string becomes 9,8,1. Now, 8 and 1 are adjacent, which sum to 9, so they can be merged. But in the original string, (1,2) are 8 and 8, which sum to 16. So merging (0,1) in the original string allows merging (1,2) in the new string, which wasn't possible before. So the DP approach based on the original string is not sufficient.

This means that the problem is not solvable by looking for non-overlapping pairs in the original string. Instead, merging a pair can create new possible pairs that were not present before. Therefore, the maximum number of 9s is not determined by the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs in the original string, but by the way merges create new pairs.

But how can we model this for a very large string?

This seems challenging. Let's think of the merging process as a chain reaction. For example:

Original string: a b c d e ... 

If we merge b and c (sum 9) into 9, then the string becomes a 9 d e ... . Now, a and 9 are adjacent. Their sum is a +9. Since a is 1-9, the sum is >= 10. So no new pair is formed. Similarly, 9 and d sum to 9+d, which could be 9 only if d=0, which is not allowed. So merging a pair can't create new pairs that sum to 9. Therefore, the merging process can only merge pairs that existed in the original string. 

Wait, this is a critical insight. Merging a pair into 9 cannot create new pairs that sum to 9. Because the 9 is adjacent to digits that are 1-9. So 9 + a is >= 10, which can't sum to 9. Therefore, the merging steps can only merge pairs that are present in the original string, but merging a pair allows for other pairs to be merged that were previously not possible due to overlapping.

Wait, but in the example 1 8 8 1:

Original pairs are (0,1) and (2,3).

After merging (0,1), the new string is 9,8,1. Now, 8 and 1 are adjacent (positions 1 and 2 in the new string), but in the original string, their positions were 1 and 2 (sum 16). After merging, their sum is 8+1=9, which forms a new pair. So this is a new pair that was not present in the original string. So merging a pair can create new pairs that were not present before.

But this contradicts the previous conclusion. What's the issue here?

Ah, the mistake is in the original example. The original digits were 1 8 8 1. So positions (0,1) are 1+8=9. Positions (1,2) are 8+8=16. Positions (2,3) are 8+1=9.

So after merging (0,1) into 9, the new string is 9,8,8,1. Now, the new pairs are (0,1) (9+8=17), (1,2) (8+8=16), (2,3) (8+1=9). So merging (0,1) in the original string allows merging (2,3) in the new string, which is possible because it's a new pair. Wait, but (2,3) in the new string corresponds to (2,3) in the original string, which was already a possible pair. So in the original string, merging (0,1) and (2,3) would be possible, but they are non-overlapping. So merging them in any order gives two 9s. So the DP approach of finding non-overlapping pairs in the original string would correctly count this as two possible merges.

But in the earlier example where merging (0,1) allows merging (1,2), but in the original string (1,2) is 8+8=16, which is not a sum of 9. So merging (0,1) would not allow merging (1,2), as that pair wasn't present in the original string. So the merging process doesn't create new pairs. Therefore, the previous conclusion holds: merging can only process pairs that are present in the original string.

But how does the first sample example allow two possible outcomes? In that case, after merging 3+6 and then 7+2 or 2+7.

Wait, but in the original string, the digits are 3 6 9 7 2 7.

The pairs in the original string are:

3+6=9 (positions 0-1)

7+2=9 (positions 3-4)

2+7=9 (positions 4-5)

So merging 3+6 first, then merging 7+2 gives 9,9,9,7. Merging 3+6 first, then merging 2+7 gives 9,9,7,9. So both 7+2 and 2+7 are pairs in the original string. So merging them in different orders is allowed, but the pairs are non-overlapping in the original string. Wait, positions 3-4 (7+2) and 4-5 (2+7) are overlapping in the original string. So merging one blocks the other. So the maximum possible merges here is two: 3+6 and either 7+2 or 2+7.

But according to the DP approach outlined earlier, when considering the original string, the pairs are non-overlapping if they are separated by at least one digit. For example, 0-1 and 3-4 are non-overlapping, so merging them would be allowed. But 3-4 and 4-5 are overlapping, so they can't be merged together. So in the DP approach, merging 3-4 would allow merging 4-5 if they were non-overlapping, but since they are overlapping, only one of them can be merged.

But according to the first sample's note, after merging 3+6 (0-1), the next merge can be either 7+2 (3-4) or 2+7 (4-5). So how is that possible?

Because after merging 0-1, the new string is 9,9,7,2,7. The original positions 3-4 and 4-5 are now in the new string as positions 2-3 (7+2) and 3-4 (2+7). These are overlapping pairs in the new string, but in the original string, the positions were 3-4 and 4-5, which are adjacent. So merging one in the original string would block the other. But according to the DP approach, the maximum number of merges is 2 (3+6 and either 7+2 or 2+7), but in the original string, those pairs are overlapping. So why does the DP approach allow merging them?

Ah, here's the mistake. The DP approach allows merging pairs in the original string if they are non-overlapping. But in the original string, the pairs 3-4 and 4-5 are overlapping. So the DP approach would not allow merging both. So the maximum possible merges would be two only if there are two non-overlapping pairs in the original string. But in this case, the two pairs are overlapping. So the DP approach would choose to merge one of them, leading to a maximum of two merges (3+6 and one of the overlapping pairs).

But how is this possible?

In the original string, the pairs are:

0-1 (3+6=9)

3-4 (7+2=9)

4-5 (2+7=9)

So the pairs at 3-4 and 4-5 are overlapping. So the maximum number of merges possible is two: merge 0-1 and either 3-4 or 4-5. 

But in the DP approach, when processing position 4 (digit 2), after merging 3-4 (positions 3-4), the next pair is 4-5 (positions 4-5). But since merging 3-4 would have used up positions 3 and 4, merging 4-5 is not allowed. So the DP approach would model this as follows:

At position 4 (digit 2), when considering merging 3-4 (sum 9), the maximum count would be dp[2].max_count + 1. dp[2] is the state up to position 2 (digit 9), which is part of the original string. After merging 3-4, the next positions are 5. So for position 5 (digit 7), the sum with 4-5 is 2+7=9, but since 4-5 was already merged, the DP would not allow merging 4-5 again.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the DP approach needs to track the positions in the original string and ensure that merged pairs are non-overlapping.

Alternatively, the problem can be viewed as a greedy choice where overlapping pairs can be merged in different orders, leading to different final numbers, but the maximum count of 9s is the same.

But given the time constraints, how do we model this efficiently?

An alternative approach is to model the problem as follows:

We need to select a set of non-overlapping pairs in the original string that sum to 9. However, merging certain pairs can lead to different possibilities. For example, in the first sample, the pairs 3-4 and 4-5 are overlapping. We can choose to merge either of them, but not both. 

But in this case, merging either gives one additional 9. So the maximum count is 2 (3-6 and one of the other pairs).

The number of distinct ways is determined by the number of choices we have when selecting overlapping pairs.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding all possible non-overlapping pairs that sum to 9, in a way that allows the maximum count. The number of distinct ways is the product of the number of choices at each overlapping group.

But how do we find overlapping groups?

This suggests that we can partition the string into regions where merging a pair in a region affects other pairs in the same region. For example, consecutive overlapping pairs form a group, and the number of ways to choose pairs in the group is the number of possible options, which depends on the group's structure.

For example, consider a sequence of digits where there are overlapping pairs. For instance, digits like 7 2 7. The pairs are 7+2 (sum 9) and 2+7 (sum 9). These two pairs are overlapping, so we can choose to merge either but not both. So each such overlapping group contributes a multiplicative factor of 2 to the total number of ways.

Another example is 7 2 7 2. The overlapping pairs are (7,2), (2,7), (7,2). The possible ways to choose non-overlapping pairs here might be more complex. For example, merging (0-1) and (2-3) gives two merges, merging (1-2) and (3-4) gives two merges. So the number of ways would be 2.

So the problem can be modeled as:

- Split the string into segments where each segment is a maximal sequence of overlapping pairs. For example, a segment could be pairs (i, i+1), (i+1, i+2), etc., each summing to 9.

For each such segment, determine the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs that can be chosen and the number of ways to select them.

The total number of distinct ways is the product of the number of ways for each segment.

But how do we split the string into these segments?

This seems promising. Let's think:

Each maximal segment where consecutive overlapping pairs sum to 9. For example:

Original string: 7 2 7.

The pairs (0-1) and (1-2) both sum to 9 and are overlapping. So this forms a single segment.

Another example: 7 2 7 2. Pairs (0-1), (1-2), (2-3) all sum to 9. This forms a single segment of three overlapping pairs.

For each such segment, we need to compute the maximum number of pairs that can be merged and the number of ways to do so.

This is similar to the problem of counting the number of ways to select non-overlapping pairs in a sequence of overlapping pairs, such that the maximum count is achieved.

For each such segment, the maximum number of pairs is floor((k+1)/2), where k is the number of pairs in the segment. For example:

- A segment with 1 pair (k=1) can have 1 pair selected.

- A segment with 2 pairs (overlapping) can have 1 pair selected.

- A segment with 3 pairs (overlapping) can have 2 pairs selected (like in a sequence of 7 2 7 2).

Wait, but in a sequence of 3 overlapping pairs (like in a 4-digit sequence a b c d where each pair sums to 9), the maximum number of pairs is 2: merge (a,b) and (c,d), or merge (b,c) and (d,e) if applicable. So for a segment of length k pairs (each overlapping with the next), the maximum number of pairs is floor(k/2) + 1. For example, if k=3, it's 2. If k=4, it's 2 + 1=3? No, perhaps not.

Wait, let's take a segment of overlapping pairs. For example, a segment of overlapping pairs: positions (i, i+1), (i+1, i+2), (i+2, i+3), etc., each summing to 9.

The maximum number of non-overlapping pairs is the same as the maximum number of independent intervals in this overlapping sequence. For overlapping intervals, the maximum is the ceiling of (number of intervals + 1) / 2. Or perhaps not.

Alternatively, it's similar to the problem of scheduling non-overlapping intervals. For a sequence of overlapping intervals, the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals is not possible, but in this case, each interval is overlapping with the next. So the maximum number of pairs is the maximum possible.

For example:

- For a single pair: 1.

- For two overlapping pairs: can choose either one.

- For three overlapping pairs (like 0-1, 1-2, 2-3): can choose two pairs (0-1 and 2-3).

- For four overlapping pairs (0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4): can choose two pairs (0-1 and 2-3) or (1-2 and 3-4). So maximum is 2.

Wait, but if the pairs are 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, then the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs is 2. Because 0-1 and 2-3 are non-overlapping, and 1-2 and 3-4 are non-overlapping. Or 0-1 and 3-4 are also non-overlapping.

So the maximum for a sequence of overlapping pairs is floor((k + 1) / 2), where k is the number of pairs in the sequence.

So for k pairs in a segment, the maximum is (k + 1) // 2.

Wait, for k=3, (3+1)/2 = 2. Which matches the earlier example. For k=4, (4+1)/2 = 2.5 floored to 2. But in the example of 4 pairs (0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4), the maximum is 2 pairs. So yes. For k=5, (5+1)/2=3.

So the maximum number of pairs per segment is (k +1)//2.

But the number of ways to select these pairs depends on the structure of the segment. For example:

- For a single pair (k=1): 1 way.

- For two overlapping pairs (k=2): 2 ways (choose either pair).

- For three overlapping pairs (k=3): 2 ways (choose pairs 0-1 and 2-3, or 1-2 and 3-4 if applicable).

Wait, for k=3 overlapping pairs (like 0-1, 1-2, 2-3), the maximum is 2 pairs (0-1 and 2-3), and there's only 1 way to choose them. But wait, in this case, the pairs are 0-1, 1-2, 2-3. So how can you choose two pairs? Only 0-1 and 2-3 are non-overlapping. So one way.

But according to the example in the first sample, when there are two overlapping pairs (like 7+2 and 2+7), you can choose either pair, leading to two different ways. So for k=2, the number of ways is 2.

But for k=3, the number of ways is 1.

So how to generalize this?

The number of ways depends on whether the number of pairs in the segment is even or odd.

For example:

- k=1: 1 way.

- k=2: 2 ways.

- k=3: 1 way.

- k=4: 3 ways.

Wait, maybe there's a pattern here. For example:

If the segment has m pairs, then the number of ways is equal to the (m + 1)th Fibonacci number. Or perhaps it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence.

Alternatively, the number of ways for a segment of length m (number of pairs) is:

If m is even: m/2 + 1.

If m is odd: (m+1)/2.

But this doesn't fit the examples.

Alternatively, the number of ways can be found using dynamic programming for each segment.

Let's model it for each segment:

For a segment of m consecutive overlapping pairs (like p_0, p_1, ..., p_{m-1}), where each p_i overlaps with p_{i+1} (i.e., p_i is at positions (i, i+1) in the segment).

We need to select the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs, which is floor((m + 1)/2).

The number of ways to select this maximum can be computed using a dynamic programming approach for the segment.

For example, for a segment of length m:

dp[m] = number of ways to select the maximum number of pairs.

The recurrence for this DP would be:

dp[i] = dp[i-2] + dp[i-3], or something similar.

But perhaps there's a pattern.

For m=1: 1 way.

m=2: 2 ways.

m=3: 1 way. Because the maximum is 2 pairs, but you can only choose p0 and p2.

m=4: 3 ways. Possible selections are:

p0 and p2, p0 and p3, p1 and p3.

Wait, no. For m=4, the maximum is 2 pairs. The possible selections are:

p0 and p2, p0 and p3, p1 and p3.

Wait, but p0 and p3 are overlapping with p2 if they are consecutive. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, let's think of the pairs as positions in the segment.

For m pairs (0,1,2,...,m-1):

Each pair is at positions (i, i+1) in the original string's segment.

To select the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs:

The optimal way is to select every other pair.

For example, for m=2: select either pair 0 or pair 1. So 2 ways.

For m=3: pairs 0 and 2. Only 1 way.

For m=4: pairs 0 and 2, 0 and 3, 1 and 3. So 3 ways.

For m=5: pairs 0, 2, 4 (only one way) or 1,3,5 (but m=5, pairs are 0-5? Wait, maybe not. For m=5 pairs in the segment, the maximum is (5+1)/2 = 3 pairs. How? For example, pairs 0, 2,4. Only one way. So the number of ways is 1.

So the number of ways seems to follow the Fibonacci sequence. For example:

m | ways

1 → 1

2 → 2

3 → 1

4 → 3

5 → 3

6 → 4

Wait, not sure. Let's think again:

For m=4:

Possible selections of two pairs:

(0,2), (0,3), (1,3).

So 3 ways.

For m=4, the number of ways is 3.

For m=5:

Maximum of 3 pairs. The only way to select them is to take pairs 0, 2,4.

So 1 way.

For m=6:

Maximum of 3 pairs. Possible selections are 0, 2,4; 0,2,5; 0,3,5; 1,3,5; 1,3,6 (but m=6, pairs are 0-5). Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

This suggests that the number of ways for a segment of m pairs is the (m//2 + 1)th term in a certain sequence. But it's not clear.

Alternatively, the number of ways for a segment of m pairs is equal to the (floor((m+1)/2))th Fibonacci number.

But for m=2, floor((2+1)/2) = 1. Fibonacci(1) is 1, but the actual ways are 2.

Hmm. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's list the number of ways for different m values:

m | ways

1 → 1

2 → 2

3 → 1

4 → 3

5 → 3

6 → 4

Wait, this seems like for even m, the number of ways is m/2 + 1. But for m=2, 2/2 +1 = 2. For m=4, 4/2+1=3. For m=6, 6/2+1=4. Which matches. For odd m:

m=1 → 1 → (1+1)/2 +0 = 1.

m=3 → (3+1)/2 +0 = 2 → but actual ways are 1. So this doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps for even m, the number of ways is (m/2) +1. For m=2: 2 → (2/2)+1=2. For m=4: (4/2)+1=3. For m=6: (6/2)+1=4. That fits. But for odd m, how?

For m=3: the maximum is 2 pairs. The number of ways is 1. For m=5, maximum is 3 pairs, number of ways 1.

So it seems that for even m, the number of ways is (m/2) +1. For odd m, it's 1.

But this doesn't explain all cases. For example, m=5: but the maximum is 3 pairs, which would require selecting every other pair. So for m=5, pairs are 0,1,2,3,4. To select 3 pairs, you must choose 0,2,4. Only one way. So yes.

But how to model this for the general case?

Another approach: for each segment of m consecutive overlapping pairs, the number of ways to select the maximum number of pairs is the number of ways to choose pairs such that no two are consecutive. For example, the maximum number of pairs is the maximum independent set in a path graph of m nodes, which is floor((m+1)/2). The number of ways is the (m+1)th Fibonacci number.

Wait, the maximum independent set in a path graph of m nodes is indeed floor((m+1)/2). But the number of ways to choose such a set is the (m+2)th Fibonacci number. For example:

m=1 → 1 node → one way → Fib(3) = 2 → no.

Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the number of ways to choose a maximum independent set in a path graph of m nodes is given by a certain recurrence. For example, for m=1: 1 way. For m=2: 2 ways (choose node 1 or node 2). For m=3: 1 way (choose nodes 1 and 3). For m=4: 3 ways (nodes 1 and 3, 1 and 4, 2 and 4). For m=5: 4 ways (1,3,5; 1,4; 2,4,5; 2,5). Wait, no. For m=5, maximum is 3 nodes. So it's possible to select 1,3,5 or 2,4, etc. This seems to get complicated.

But perhaps there's a pattern where the number of ways is the same as the Fibonacci sequence. For example:

m=1 → 1 way.

m=2 → 2 ways.

m=3 → 1 way → doesn't fit.

But for m=4 → 3 ways. m=5 → 3 ways. m=6 → 4 ways. This sequence is 1,2,1,3,3,4... which doesn't match Fibonacci.

Alternatively, perhaps for even m, the number of ways is (m/2) + 1, and for odd m, it's 1.

But m=3 gives 1, m=5 gives 1, which fits. For m=4, even, gives 3 = 4/2 +1 = 2+1=3. For m=6, even, 6/2+1=4. So this pattern holds for even m. For odd m, it's 1.

But how to verify this?

Let's take m=4 even. 4 pairs. Maximum is 2. The ways are 3:

- Pair 0 and 2.

- Pair 0 and 3.

- Pair 1 and 3.

Yes, 3 ways. Which is 4/2 +1 = 3.

For m=6 even. Maximum is 3 pairs. Ways are 4:

- Pair 0, 2,4.

- Pair 0, 2,5.

- Pair 0, 3,5.

- Pair 1,3,5.

Yes, four ways. Which is 6/2 +1 = 4.

So this pattern seems to hold.

For odd m:

m=3: 1 way.

m=5: 1 way.

So for each segment, the number of ways is:

- If the segment has m consecutive overlapping pairs:

   - if m is even: (m/2) +1.

   - if m is odd: 1.

But how to compute this for the entire string?

So the overall approach would be:

1. Iterate through the string to find all possible pairs that sum to 9.

2. Group these pairs into segments of consecutive overlapping pairs. For example, if pairs are (i,i+1), (i+1, i+2), (i+3,i+4), then (i,i+1) and (i+1,i+2) form a segment, and (i+3,i+4) forms another segment.

3. For each segment:

   a. Compute the number of pairs in the segment (m).

   b. Compute the contribution to the total number of ways based on whether m is even or odd.

4. Multiply the contributions of all segments to get the total number of distinct numbers.

But what if there are segments where merging pairs in the segment could lead to different ways but are separated by non-overlapping segments?

The key idea is that the choices in each segment are independent of other segments. So the total number of ways is the product of the ways for each segment.

But first, we need to find all segments of consecutive overlapping pairs.

How to find these segments:

- Iterate through the string, checking for pairs (i,i+1) that sum to 9.

- For each such pair, check if it is part of a sequence of overlapping pairs.

For example, pairs at positions (i,i+1), (i+1, i+2), etc.

Each segment is a maximal sequence of consecutive overlapping pairs.

For example:

Original pairs: (0,1), (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), (6,7), (7,8).

Segments are:

0-1,1-2 (overlapping, forming a segment of length 2).

3-4 (segment of length 1).

5-6,6-7,7-8 (segment of length 3).

So for each such segment, compute the number of ways.

In the example above, the segments would contribute:

For the first segment (m=2 even): 2 ways.

Second segment (m=1 odd): 1 way.

Third segment (m=3 odd): 1 way.

Total ways: 2 * 1 * 1 = 2.

So the answer would be 2.

But this depends on how the pairs are grouped into segments.

So the algorithm steps are:

1. Find all pairs (i, i+1) where s[i] + s[i+1] == 9.

2. Group consecutive overlapping pairs into segments. Two pairs are overlapping if their positions are consecutive, like (i, i+1) and (i+1, i+2).

3. For each segment, compute m (number of pairs in the segment).

4. For each segment, compute the number of ways as follows:

   a. If m is even: ways = (m // 2) + 1.

   b. If m is odd: ways = 1.

5. Multiply all the ways of each segment to get the total number of ways.

But wait, why is this the case? Because the choices in each segment are independent. For example, in the first sample input, the segments are:

- The pair (0,1) (sum 3+6=9) → segment length 1 (m=1). Contribution 1 way.

- The pairs (3,4) (7+2=9) and (4,5) (2+7=9) → overlapping. So segment length 2 (m=2). Contribution (2//2)+1 = 2 ways.

So total ways 1 * 2 = 2, which matches the first sample.

Another example: input 123456789987654321. The output is 1.

Possible pairs: 9+9=18 (no). 9+8=17 (no). 8+9=17 (no). So perhaps there are no pairs that sum to 9. So the answer is 1.

But according to the note, the answer is 1, which suggests that there are no overlapping segments contributing multiple ways.

So the algorithm seems to fit.

But how to handle the maximum number of 9s?

Wait, the maximum number of 9s is the sum of the maximum pairs from each segment. For each segment of m pairs, the maximum pairs is (m +1) // 2.

So the total maximum 9s is the sum of (m+1)//2 for all segments.

But the problem requires us to count the number of distinct ways to achieve this maximum. So even if two different segments contribute different ways, the total is the product of the ways of each segment.

But how does this model ensure that the segments are non-overlapping?

Because the segments are groups of consecutive overlapping pairs. So pairs from different segments are non-overlapping.

For example, consider two segments: the first is pairs (0-1), (1-2), and the second is (3-4), (4-5). The pairs in the first segment are overlapping, and pairs in the second are overlapping. But between segments, there is at least one pair that is not part of the segment. So the segments are non-overlapping. Hence, the maximum pairs for each segment can be added together.

So the algorithm is:

Compute all segments of consecutive overlapping pairs.

For each segment, compute the maximum number of pairs ( (m+1)//2 ), and the number of ways for that segment.

The total maximum pairs is the sum of (m+1)//2 for all segments.

The total number of ways is the product of the number of ways for each segment.

But wait, in the first sample, the maximum pairs is 2. The segments are:

- One segment of length 1 (m=1), which contributes 1 pair.

- One segment of length 2 (m=2), which contributes (2+1)/2=1.5 floored to 1. So total is 1+1=2.

But (m+1)//2 for m=1 is (1+1)//2 = 1.

For m=2, (2+1)//2=1. So total 2 pairs. Which matches.

The number of ways is 1 * 2 = 2.

Which matches the first sample.

So the algorithm is:

1. Find all pairs of adjacent digits that sum to 9.

2. Group these pairs into segments of consecutive overlapping pairs.

3. For each segment, compute m (number of pairs in the segment), and compute the contribution to the maximum pairs ( (m+1) // 2 ), and the contribution to the number of ways ( (m//2) +1 if m is even, else 1 ).

4. The total maximum pairs is the sum of all (m+1)//2.

5. The total number of ways is the product of all the ways for each segment.

But wait, the problem statement requires us to output the number of distinct numbers that can be obtained with the maximum possible number of 9s. So the way we merge the pairs affects the order of 9s in the final number. For example, merging a pair earlier in the string can change the order of the 9s in the final number. But in the algorithm above, we assume that the order of merging pairs in different segments doesn't affect the final count. However, the order within a segment is considered in the ways computed for that segment.

But according to the first sample, merging pairs in different segments can lead to different final numbers. For example, merging (0-1) first, then merging either (3-4) or (4-5) leads to different final numbers. But according to the algorithm, the ways are computed as 2 (from the second segment of m=2), leading to a product of 1 * 2 = 2, which is correct.

So the algorithm correctly captures the number of ways by considering the product of choices in each segment.

So the steps to solve the problem are:

- Parse the input string into a list of digits.

- Iterate through the string, collecting all pairs (i, i+1) where the sum is 9.

- Group these pairs into segments of consecutive overlapping pairs.

- For each segment, compute m and the number of ways.

- Multiply the ways for all segments to get the answer.

- If there are no such pairs, the answer is 1.

Now, how to implement this in Python efficiently for very large input (up to 1e5 digits)?

The steps are:

1. Read the input string.

2. Iterate through the string from left to right, finding all pairs (i, i+1) where s[i] + s[i+1] == 9.

3. Group consecutive overlapping pairs into segments.

For example, for the list of pairs' indices, we can group them into segments where each pair's start is previous pair's start +1.

For example, pairs at indices (0,1), (1,2), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6):

Group 0: (0,1), (1,2).

Group 1: (3,4), (4,5), (5,6).

4. For each group, compute the number of pairs (m).

5. For each group, compute the ways as per even/odd m.

6. Multiply all the ways from all groups. If there are no groups, multiply 1.

Now, the code:

We can represent the groups as lists of consecutive pairs.

But since the input can be up to 1e5 digits, we need to process this efficiently.

Let's think of the steps:

Initialize a list to track the current group.

Iterate through the string, checking for pairs.

For each i from 0 to len(s)-2:

Check if s[i] + s[i+1] == 9.

If yes, then check if this pair is consecutive to the previous pair.

For example, the previous pair in the current group would be i-1 and i. So if the current pair starts at i, and the previous pair in the group ends at i, then it's consecutive.

Wait, a pair is two consecutive digits. So the indices for the pairs are (i, i+1). So two consecutive pairs (i, i+1) and (i+1, i+2) overlap.

So to group consecutive pairs, we can track the end index of the previous pair.

For example, previous pair ends at i. Current pair starts at i. So they are overlapping.

So the code can be:

prev_end = -2

current_group = 0

groups = []

for i in range(len(s)-1):

    if int(s[i]) + int(s[i+1]) ==9:

        if i == prev_end +1:

            # part of current group

            current_group +=1

            prev_end = i+1

        else:

            # new group

            if current_group >0:

                groups.append(current_group)

            current_group =1

            prev_end = i+1

    else:

        if current_group >0:

            groups.append(current_group)

            current_group =0

        prev_end = -2

# after loop, check if current_group >0

if current_group >0:

    groups.append(current_group)

But this code is not correct. Because for each pair (i, i+1), the current_group is incremented by 1, but the current_group should represent the number of pairs in the group. For example, consecutive pairs (0,1) and (1,2) form a group of 2 pairs.

So the code should track the start of the current group.

Alternatively:

current_group_length = 0

groups = []

for i in range(len(s) -1):

    if int(s[i]) + int(s[i+1]) ==9:

        if current_group_length ==0:

            current_group_length =1

        else:

            # check if this pair is consecutive to the previous pair in the group

            # previous pair ended at i-1+1 =i.

            # current pair starts at i.

            # so if the previous pair ended at i, then the current pair starts at i, which is overlapping.

            # So yes.

            current_group_length +=1

    else:

        if current_group_length >0:

            groups.append(current_group_length)

            current_group_length =0

# after loop, add any remaining group

if current_group_length >0:

    groups.append(current_group_length)

But this code doesn't handle overlapping pairs correctly. For example, if we have pairs at 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, then the code would count current_group_length as 3.

Yes, because each consecutive pair increments the current_group_length by 1.

But how? Let's see:

For i=0:

Check 0-1. Sum to 9. current_group_length becomes 1.

For i=1:

Check 1-2. Sum to 9. current_group_length increments to 2.

For i=2:

Check 2-3. Sum to 9. current_group_length increments to 3.

So the group is added when a non-pair is found.

So the code correctly groups consecutive overlapping pairs into a single group, with current_group_length being the number of pairs in the group.

For example, the group of consecutive overlapping pairs (0-1, 1-2, 2-3) will have current_group_length 3, which is added to groups.

Once the groups are computed, for each group m in groups:

Compute ways for each group.

If m is even: (m//2) +1.

If m is odd: 1.

Multiply all ways.

Now, the code.

Testing the first sample:

Sample input: 369727.

The digits are 3,6,9,7,2,7.

Pairs:

0-1 (3+6=9), sum to 9.

3-4 (7+2=9), sum to 9.

4-5 (2+7=9), sum to 9.

So groups:

The first pair is at 0-1. Then next pairs are at 3-4 and 4-5.

So group 0 is length 1 (0-1 is a single pair, no consecutive pairs after it).

Then, the pairs at 3-4 and 4-5 are consecutive. So group 1 has length 2.

So groups = [1, 2].

For group 1 (m=2), ways is (2//2)+1=2.

Group 0 (m=1), ways is 1.

Total ways: 1 * 2 = 2.

Which matches the first sample.

Another example: 123456789987654321.

The pairs are:

Looking for pairs that sum to 9.

For example, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, etc.

Assuming none sum to 9 except perhaps the 9 and 8 in the middle. But the input is 123456789987654321.

The pairs are:

Looking for adjacent digits summing to 9.

For example, 9 and 9 sum to 18. 9 and 8 sum to 17. 8 and 9 sum to 17. 9 and 9 sum to 18. 7 and 6 sum to 13. Etc.

So no pairs sum to 9. Hence, groups is empty. The answer is 1.

Which matches the second sample.

Third sample: input 1. No pairs. Answer is 1.

So the code works.

Now, code implementation.

The code steps:

Read the input string.

Initialize current_group_length to 0.

Iterate through the string up to len(s)-1.

For each i, check if s[i] + s[i+1] ==9.

If yes, increment current_group_length.

Else, if current_group_length >0, add to groups and reset.

After the loop, add any remaining group.

For each group in groups, compute the number of ways.

Multiply them all.

If there are no groups, the answer is 1.

So the code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()
    groups = []
    current_group = 0

    for i in range(len(s) - 1):
        a, b = int(s[i]), int(s[i+1])
        if a + b == 9:
            current_group += 1
        else:
            if current_group > 0:
                groups.append(current_group)
                current_group = 0
    if current_group > 0:
        groups.append(current_group)

    result = 1
    for m in groups:
        if m % 2 == 0:
            ways = (m // 2) + 1
        else:
            ways = 1
        result *= ways

    print(result, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
123456789987654321
""",
            "output": \
"""\
1
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed 😎')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed 😎

```

Another example: input 1818.

Digits:1,8,1,8.

Pairs:

0-1: 1+8=9 → yes.

1-2: 8+1=9 → yes.

2-3:1+8=9 → yes.

So code:

i=0: pair found → current_group=1.

i=1: pair found → current_group=2.

i=2: pair found → current_group=3.

i=3: loop ends.

After loop, current_group=3 is added to groups.

groups = [3].

For m=3 (odd), ways=1. So output is 1.

But according to the example:

Original pairs are 0-1, 1-2, 2-3.

But merging pairs 0-1 and 2-3 (non-overlapping) gives two 9s. So the maximum is 2.

But according to our code, the group is m=3, which has (3+1)//2= 2 pairs. But the code's way for m=3 is 1.

So the code would output 1 way.

But how can there be only one way? Let's see:

The group is 3 pairs.

The maximum pairs is 2.

The ways to achieve this is 1.

Yes: the only way is to merge pairs 0-1 and 2-3. So the code's output is correct.

But what if the group is m=4?

For example, pairs 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4.

Code groups as m=4.

Ways: (4//2) +1= 2+1=3.

So three ways.

Which would be:

Merge 0-1 and 2-3.

Merge 0-1 and 3-4.

Merge 1-2 and 3-4.

Thus, three distinct ways.

Which is correct.

Thus, the code should be correct.
</think>

```python
s = input().strip()
groups = []
current_group = 0

for i in range(len(s) - 1):
    a, b = int(s[i]), int(s[i+1])
    if a + b == 9:
        current_group += 1
    else:
        if current_group > 0:
            groups.append(current_group)
            current_group = 0
if current_group > 0:
    groups.append(current_group)

result = 1
for m in groups:
    if m % 2 == 0:
        ways = (m // 2) + 1
    else:
        ways = 1
    result *= ways

print(result)
```
