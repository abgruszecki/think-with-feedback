Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the problem is about converting array a into array b using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are either increasing all multiples of i by 1 or decreasing them by 1. But the catch is that b1 is unknown, and we have to answer q queries where each query gives a possible x for b1 and we need to compute the minimal operations for each.

Hmm. Let's think about how the operations affect the array. Each operation on i affects all multiples of i. That's similar to the sieve of Eratosthenes approach. So, for example, choosing i=2 would affect elements at positions 2,4,6, etc. But since the array is of size n, it's all multiples up to n.

The key insight here is that the order of operations might not matter in the optimal solution. Because each operation is additive. Wait, but since we can do increments and decrements, perhaps we can model the required changes in terms of the number of times each i is used for increment and decrement.

Let's think of the problem in reverse. Let's say we have a difference array d where d_i = (b_i - a_i). But since b_1 is unknown, except for the first element, all other elements have known d_i (since their b_i is given). For the first element, the d_1 depends on the query x, which is x - a_1.

But the operations are such that when you perform an operation on i, it affects all multiples of i. So each operation on i contributes to the sum of the differences for all multiples of i. The problem is to find for each i, how many times we apply increment and decrement operations such that the sum of all such contributions equals the required difference array d.

Wait, but each increment operation on i adds 1 to all multiples of i. Each decrement subtracts 1. So the net effect for each position j is the sum over all divisors i of j of (incr_i - decr_i), where incr_i is the number of increment operations on i, and decr_i is the number of decrement operations on i. Because each operation on i affects j if i divides j.

So the problem reduces to finding incr_i and decr_i such that for each j, sum_{i | j} (incr_i - decr_i) = d_j. And we need to minimize the total number of operations, which is sum (incr_i + decr_i).

But how do we model this? Let's see. Let’s denote delta_i = incr_i - decr_i. Then, the total operations for i is (incr_i + decr_i) = |delta_i| + 2*min(incr_i, decr_i). Wait, no. Because incr_i and decr_i can be represented as delta_i = incr_i - decr_i. Let's solve for incr_i and decr_i. Let’s say delta_i is positive. Then incr_i = decr_i + delta_i. The total operations would be incr_i + decr_i = delta_i + 2*decr_i. But to minimize this sum, we would set decr_i to 0, making incr_i = delta_i, so total is delta_i. Similarly, if delta_i is negative, then decr_i would be incr_i + (-delta_i), and the total is incr_i + decr_i = -delta_i + 2*incr_i. Again, to minimize, set incr_i to 0, so decr_i is -delta_i, total is -delta_i. So in either case, the minimal operations for i is |delta_i|. Because when delta_i is positive, you do delta_i increments. When negative, you do -delta_i decrements. Because any combination would add up to more. Wait, that's only true if delta_i can be achieved by either increments or decrements. Because each operation on i contributes 1 per multiple j, so delta_i is the net change. So the minimal number of operations for i is indeed |delta_i|, since each increment or decrement contributes 1 to delta_i. So delta_i is exactly (number of increments - number of decrements) for i. So the minimal total operations for i is |delta_i|.

Wait, that makes sense. Because for each i, you can either do increments or decrements. For example, if delta_i is 5, you can do 5 increments (total 5 operations). If delta_i is -3, you do 3 decrements (3 operations). If delta_i is 0, you do nothing. So the minimal operations for each i is |delta_i|.

So the problem reduces to finding a set of delta_i such that for each j, sum_{i divides j} delta_i = d_j, and the sum of |delta_i| for all i is minimized.

So the problem now is to compute the delta_i for each i, given the d_j's (except for d_1, which varies per query), and then compute the sum of |delta_i| for each query.

But how do the delta_i relate to the d_j's? The key is that the delta_i's form a Möbius inversion-like structure. Because for each j, the sum of delta_i for i dividing j must equal d_j.

Wait, the deltas must form a function such that their divisor sums equal d_j. So to find delta_i for all i in 1..n, given that sum_{i divides j} delta_i = d_j for all j. This is similar to inclusion-exclusion, and the solution here is that delta_i can be computed using Möbius inversion. Because the delta_i's are the Möbius transform of the d_j's.

Wait, no. Let's think again. Let's model the problem as follows: For each j, d_j is the sum of delta_i for all i that divide j. So delta is a function such that for each j, d_j is the sum_{i divides j} delta_i. Then, using Möbius inversion, the delta_i can be computed as delta_i = sum_{j divides i} mu(j/i) * d_j, but I'm not sure. Wait, the standard Möbius inversion formula says that if g(n) = sum_{d | n} f(d), then f(n) = sum_{d | n} mu(d) g(n/d). Wait, maybe the other way. Let me think.

Suppose for all n, we have g(n) = sum_{d | n} f(d). Then f(n) can be expressed as sum_{d | n} mu(d) * g(n/d), or perhaps sum_{d | n} mu(n/d) * g(d). Let me check an example. For n=1, d=1: g(1) = f(1). So f(1) = g(1). For n=2, g(2) = f(1) + f(2). So f(2) = g(2) - f(1) = g(2) - g(1). Then for n=3, similarly. For n=4, g(4) = f(1)+f(2)+f(4). So f(4) = g(4) - f(1) -f(2). Then, using Möbius inversion, the formula for f(n) is sum_{d | n} mu(n/d) * g(d). Wait, for n=2: divisors are 1,2. So sum mu(2/1)*g(1) + mu(2/2)*g(2). mu(2) is -1, mu(1) is 1. So f(2) = (-1)*g(1) + 1*g(2) = g(2) - g(1), which matches. So yes, the Möbius inversion formula gives f(n) = sum_{d | n} mu(n/d) * g(d). So in this problem, the delta_i's are the f(i), and the d_j's are the g(j). So to compute delta_i, we can use Möbius inversion.

Wait, but in our case, the delta_i is such that for each j, sum_{i divides j} delta_i = d_j. So the delta_i's are the Möbius inversion of the d_j's. So delta_i = sum_{k divides i} mu(k) * d_{i/k} ? Wait, maybe not. Let me rephrase. For each j, d_j is the sum of delta_i for all i that divide j. So the function d is the sum over divisors of j of delta. So to compute delta_i, the Möbius inversion formula tells us that delta_i is the sum over all j dividing i of mu(i/j) * d_j. Wait, no. Wait, the Möbius inversion says that if g(n) = sum_{d | n} f(d), then f(n) = sum_{d | n} mu(d) * g(n/d). So here, delta corresponds to f, and d corresponds to g. So delta_i = sum_{d | i} mu(d) * d_{i/d}. Wait, perhaps. Let's see for example: i=1. delta_1 = mu(1)*d_1/1 = d_1. For i=2, sum over d divides 2 (d=1 and 2). So delta_2 = mu(1)*d_2/1 + mu(2)*d_1/2? Wait, no. Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, the Möbius inversion formula states that for multiplicative functions, if g(n) = sum_{d|n} f(d), then f(n) = sum_{d|n} mu(d) g(n/d). So in our case, the function d(n) is the sum of delta(d) for all d dividing n. So delta(n) is sum_{d|n} mu(d) * d(n/d). Wait, yes. So for each i, delta_i is sum_{d | i} mu(d) * d_{i/d} }, where d_{i/d} is the value of the d array at position i/d.

Wait, but the d array here is the desired differences. For example, for j= i/d, where d divides i. So the formula for delta_i is sum_{d | i} mu(d) * d_{i/d}.

But the problem is that the d array has the first element (d_1) varying per query. All other elements (d_2, ..., d_n) are fixed. So for each query x, the d_1 is x - a_1. The rest are fixed as (b_i - a_i) for i >=2.

So the approach should be to precompute all the delta_i's that depend on d_1 (i.e., those that have mu(d) multiplied by d_1 in their sum). Then, for each query x, compute the delta_i's by including the contribution from d_1 (which is x - a_1) and the other fixed terms.

But how does d_1 affect the delta_i's? Let's split delta_i into two parts: the part that depends on d_1 and the part that doesn't. Because for some delta_i's, the sum includes d_1. For example, for delta_1, since i=1. The divisors of 1 are only 1. So delta_1 = mu(1) * d_{1/1} = 1 * d_1. So delta_1 is directly equal to d_1. For delta_2, divisors are 1 and 2. So delta_2 = mu(1)*d_2/1 (which is d_2) + mu(2)*d_1 / 2. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is delta_i = sum_{d | i} mu(d) * d_{i/d}.

Wait, let's take i=2. The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2.

So delta_2 = mu(1) * d_{2/1} + mu(2) * d_{2/2} = 1 * d_2 + (-1) * d_1.

So delta_2 = d_2 - d_1.

Wait, but wait. So delta_2 depends on d_1. Similarly, delta_3 = d_3 - d_1. Because for i=3, divisors are 1 and 3. So delta_3 = mu(1)*d_3 + mu(3)*d_1. mu(3) is -1. So delta_3 = d_3 - d_1.

For i=4, divisors are 1, 2, 4.

delta_4 = mu(1)*d_4 + mu(2)*d_2 + mu(4)*d_1.

But mu(4) is 0 (since 4 has square factors). So delta_4 = d_4 - d_2.

So delta_4 only depends on d_4 and d_2, not d_1.

Wait, but how? Let's see. For i=4, divisors are 1,2,4.

d is 1: then i/d is 4, so term is mu(1)*d_4 = 1*d_4.

d is 2: i/d is 2, so term is mu(2)*d_2 = (-1)*d_2.

d is 4: i/d is 1, so term is mu(4)*d_1 = 0 *d_1.

So delta_4 = d_4 - d_2.

So delta_4 doesn't depend on d_1. Hmm. So some delta_i's depend on d_1, others do not. Which ones?

Only those i where in their divisors, there exists a d such that i/d =1. Because in that case, d_1 is multiplied by mu(d). For example, in delta_i where i has a divisor d equal to i. Because then i/d =1. For that divisor, d_1 is multiplied by mu(i). Because if d is i, then d_1 is multiplied by mu(i) * d_{i/d} = mu(i)*d_1.

So delta_i can be written as sum_{d | i} mu(d) * d_{i/d} = [sum_{d | i, d != i} mu(d) * d_{i/d}] + mu(i) * d_1.

So for any i, delta_i can be split into two parts: a part that depends on d_1 (mu(i) * d_1) if i is a divisor of i (which is always true), but wait, mu(i) is zero if i has square factors. So for i that are not square-free, mu(i) is zero, so the d_1 term doesn't contribute. So only for square-free i's, where the number of prime factors is even or odd (so mu(i) is 1 or -1), the delta_i will have a term involving d_1.

Wait, mu(i) is the Möbius function. It is zero if i has a squared prime factor. So for example, i=4 is not square-free, so mu(4)=0. So in delta_4, the term involving d_1 is mu(4) * d_1, which is zero. So delta_4 doesn't depend on d_1.

So, in general, for i to have mu(i) non-zero, i must be square-free. So for square-free i's, delta_i has a term of mu(i)*d_1, plus other terms.

So, delta_i can be written as:

delta_i = (mu(i) * d_1) + (sum_{d | i, d != i} mu(d) * d_{i/d} )

But since d_{i/d} for i/d >=1. So for i/d >=2 (since d is a proper divisor of i, except when d=i). So the sum is over d such that d divides i, and d !=i, so i/d is an integer >=2.

But those terms are fixed, because d_2, d_3, ..., d_n are known. Only d_1 varies per query.

So, for each i, delta_i can be expressed as:

delta_i = c_i + (mu(i) * d_1)

where c_i is a precomputable constant (sum over d | i, d != i: mu(d) * d_{i/d} )

So, the key insight here is that for each query x, the delta_i's can be expressed as c_i plus mu(i) multiplied by (x - a_1) (since d_1 = x - a_1). Because d_1 in the problem is x_i - a_1.

Wait, yes. Because the original a array's first element is a_1, and for each query x_i, the desired b_1 is x_i, so d_1 = x_i - a_1.

So delta_i = c_i + mu(i) * (x_i - a_1).

But wait, the c_i is sum_{d | i, d !=i} mu(d) * d_{i/d}.

Wait, but for example, when i=2, the sum is over d=1. Because d divides i=2, and d != i. So sum is mu(1)*d_{2/1} = 1 * d_2. So delta_2 = d_2 - (x_i - a_1) * 1. Because mu(2) is -1. So delta_2 = d_2 + mu(2)*d_1. Since d_1 = x_i - a_1.

So yes, the formula holds.

So the idea is to precompute for each i, the c_i (the sum part) and the coefficient of d_1 (mu(i)).

Once we have that, for each query x_i, we can compute d_1 = x_i - a_1. Then, for each i, delta_i is c_i + mu(i) * d_1. The total operations required is the sum of the absolute values of delta_i for all i from 1 to n.

But how do we compute this efficiently, especially given that n and q are up to 2e5?

First, we need to precompute for each i, the c_i and mu(i). Then, for each query, the sum is sum_{i=1 to n} |c_i + mu(i)*d_1|, where d_1 is (x_i - a_1).

So, the problem reduces to, for each query, compute the sum of absolute values of (c_i + k_i * (x - a_1)), where k_i is mu(i), and c_i is a precomputed constant.

But how can we compute this sum efficiently for each query x?

This seems challenging because for each query, we have to process 2e5 terms. With q=2e5 queries, this would be O(4e10) operations, which is impossible.

So, the key is to find a way to represent the sum in a way that can be computed in O(1) per query, after some pre-processing.

Let's see. Let's denote for each query x, d_1 = x - a_1. So each query's sum is sum |c_i + mu(i)*d_1|.

Let me denote t = d_1. Then, the sum is sum |c_i + mu(i)*t|.

So the problem is to compute sum |c_i + mu(i)*t| for various t values.

We can split the terms into two groups: those where mu(i) is 1, 0, or -1. Because mu(i) can only be -1, 0, or 1.

So, for each i:

- If mu(i) is 0, then the term is |c_i|, since mu(i)*t is zero. So these terms are fixed and can be precomputed once.

- For mu(i) = 1: the term is |c_i + t|.

- For mu(i) = -1: the term is |c_i - t|.

So, the sum can be broken down into three parts:

sum_0 (precomputed sum of |c_i| for i with mu(i)=0) +

sum_{i: mu(i)=1} |c_i + t| +

sum_{i: mu(i)=-1} |c_i - t|.

Now, the variables here are t. So for each query, t is x_i - a_1. So for each query, t is known, and we need to compute the sum of absolute values of (c_i + t) for mu=1 terms and (c_i - t) for mu=-1 terms.

The sum of absolute values can be optimized by sorting the terms and using binary search to find the points where the expressions inside the absolute value change sign. For example, for the mu=1 terms, the term |c_i + t| is equal to (c_i + t) if c_i + t >=0, else -(c_i + t). So the point where the sign changes is t = -c_i. Similarly, for mu=-1 terms, |c_i - t| is (t - c_i) if t >= c_i, else (c_i - t). The sign changes at t = c_i.

So for each query's t, the sum for mu=1 terms can be broken into two parts: those terms where c_i + t >=0 and those where it's negative. Similarly for mu=-1 terms.

But for each group (mu=1 and mu=-1), we can pre-sort the c_i values, so that for a given t, we can compute the sum efficiently.

Let's think about the mu=1 group. Let's collect all c_i where mu(i)=1. Sort them. For a given t, the term |c_i + t| can be rewritten as |t + c_i|. Let's call this group A.

For group A, when we sort them in ascending order, let's say the sorted list is A_sorted. Then, the breakpoint is at t = -c_i. So for all c_i <= -t, the term is -(c_i + t), and for c_i > -t, the term is (c_i + t). Wait, no. Wait, if t is fixed, then the term is |c_i + t|. So for a particular c_i, the term is positive if c_i + t >=0, else negative. So the breakpoint for each c_i is at c_i >= -t.

So for the sorted list of c_i in group A, we can find the first index where c_i >= -t. All elements before that index contribute (-c_i - t) to the sum, and the elements from that index contribute (c_i + t).

The sum for group A would be:

sum_{c_i < -t} (-c_i - t) + sum_{c_i >= -t} (c_i + t).

Similarly, for group B (mu=-1), the terms are |c_i - t|. The breakpoint is c_i <= t. So for group B:

sum_{c_i <= t} (t - c_i) + sum_{c_i > t} (c_i - t).

So for each group, if we have the sorted list of c_i's, we can perform a binary search to find the split point and compute the sum efficiently using prefix sums.

So the steps to handle this are:

1. Precompute for each i, mu(i), c_i, and sum_0 (sum of |c_i| where mu(i)=0).

2. Separate the c_i's into two groups: group A (mu=1) and group B (mu=-1).

3. Sort group A in ascending order, compute prefix sums for group A.

4. Sort group B in ascending order, compute prefix sums for group B.

Then, for each query:

a. Compute t = x_i - a_1.

b. Compute the sum for group A:

   - Find the split index in group A where c_i >= -t.

   - The sum is (sum of (-c_i - t) for elements < split) + (sum of (c_i + t) for elements >= split).

   Which can be rewritten as:

   (- (sum of c_i < -t) - t * cnt_less) + (sum of c_i >= -t + t * cnt_ge)).

   But with prefix sums, this can be done efficiently.

c. Similarly compute the sum for group B.

d. The total sum is sum_0 + sum_A + sum_B.

This approach would allow each query to be processed in O(log m) time, where m is the number of elements in group A and B. Since m can be up to 2e5, but log(2e5) is around 20, this would be manageable even for 2e5 queries.

So, the main steps are:

- Precompute mu for all i up to n.

- Precompute c_i for all i.

- Split into groups and precompute their sorted lists and prefix sums.

Now, let's see how to compute mu(i) for all i up to n.

The Möbius function can be computed using a sieve of Eratosthenes approach. We can precompute the smallest prime factor (spf) for each number, then compute mu based on the prime factors. For each i:

- If i has a squared prime factor (i.e., any prime p where p^2 divides i), then mu[i] = 0.

- Otherwise, mu[i] is (-1)^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of i.

So the steps to compute mu are:

Initialize mu as 1 for all i.

For each prime p, for multiples of p:

   For each i divisible by p, divide i by p. If divisible again (i/p divisible by p), then mu[i] =0.

   Else, mu[i] *= -1.

This can be done via the sieve approach.

Once mu is computed, we can proceed.

Next, compute c_i for each i.

c_i is sum_{d | i, d !=i} mu(d) * d_{i/d}.

But wait, d_{i/d} is the difference for the element i/d. But for i/d >=2, because d !=i, so i/d >=1, but when d is 1, i/d is i, which is >=1. Wait, no. For example, if i=2, d=1 is a divisor (d !=i), so i/d=2. So d_{i/d} is d_2.

But for d_2, it is (b_2 - a_2). Because in the problem statement, all elements except b_1 are fixed. So for all j >=2, d_j is (b_j - a_j), and d_1 is variable.

So when we precompute c_i, the terms involving d_j for j >=2 are fixed. So c_i can be precomputed once.

So for each i, c_i is the sum over all d dividing i (excluding d=i) of mu(d) multiplied by the fixed d_{i/d}.

But i/d can be j >=2 (since d <i). For example, d=1, i/d=i. But if i >=2, then i/d is i, which could be >=2. So for example, i=2, d=1: i/d=2. So d_{2} is fixed.

So for i=1, the divisors are only 1. But in the formula for c_i, we exclude d=i. So for i=1, d must be divisors of 1 other than 1. There are none. So c_1 is 0. Then delta_1 is c_1 + mu(1)*d_1 = 0 + 1*d_1 =d_1.

So the steps to compute c_i are:

For each i in 1..n:

   c_i = sum over d in divisors of i, d !=i, of mu(d) * d_{i/d}.

But how to compute this efficiently for all i up to 2e5?

The straightforward approach would be for each i, find all proper divisors d (d divides i, d !=i), and sum mu(d) * d_{i/d}.

But for n=2e5, this would be O(n*sqrt(n)), which is not feasible.

Alternative approach: for each j >=2, and d >=1, such that j*d <=n, and j*d is not equal to d*j (wait, no). Wait, for each j, and d such that j = i/d, where d divides i. So i must be j*d. So for each j >=2, and d such that j*d <=n, and d divides j*d. So d is a divisor of j*d. But j*d is i. So for each j, and for each multiple i of j where i = j*d, then d must be a divisor of i.

Wait, this is a bit complicated. Alternatively, for each j >=2, we can precompute all i where i/d =j, which implies that d = i/j. And since d must be a proper divisor of i (d <i), then i must be j*d, and d must divide i. So i/j must be a divisor of i. But i/j is d, which divides i. So j must be a divisor of i. Wait, no. Because i = j*d, so d must divide i. But d = i/j. So substituting, d must divide j*d. So d divides j*d, which is always true. So for each j >=2, and for any multiple i of j (i = j * k, where k >=1), then d =k is a proper divisor of i if k <i. So for example, j=2, k=3: i=6. Then d=3 is a proper divisor of 6. Then i/d=2. So for j=2, the term mu(d) * d_{i/d} is mu(3) * d_2. So in this case, for i=6, d=3, j=2.

But how to loop through all possible j and d to compute the contribution to i = j*d?

An alternative approach is to precompute for all possible d and j, and accumulate the sum for i =d*j.

But j >=2, and d must be a divisor of i (j*d). Since i =d*j, d must be a divisor of d*j. Which is always true. But the proper divisor part is that d must not be equal to i. Since i =d*j, d <i implies j >=2. Because if j >=2, then d*j >=d*2 >=d*2 >=2 (since d is at least 1). So for i =d*j, d must be a proper divisor of i (d <i). Which is true when j >=1 and d >=1, but j must be at least 2, since i/d must be j >=2.

Wait, j is i/d, which must be >=2.

So j must be >=2, and d must be a proper divisor of i (d <i). So for each j >=2, and for all possible d >=1, such that i =d*j <=n, and j >=2.

So for each j from 2 to n:

   For each d from 1 to n//j:

       i = j*d.

       if i >n: skip.

       then, d is a proper divisor of i (since j >=2, so d*j =i >=2*d >=d*2 >=2*1=2. So i >=2, and d can be 1, leading to i= j*1= j >=2. So d=1, i= j*1= j >=2. So d=1 is a proper divisor of i since 1 < j (as j >=2). )

       So, for each i =j*d, where j >=2 and d >=1, and j*d <=n:

           the term mu(d) * (b_j - a_j) contributes to c_i.

Because d_{i/d} is d_j =b_j -a_j (since i/d =j >=2).

So the algorithm to compute c_i for all i is as follows:

Initialize all c_i to 0.

For each j in 2..n:

   dj = b[j] - a[j] (note: in the problem, the input's third line is the array b, where b[0] is -1, and others are given. So for 1-based indices, j ranges from 2 to n in 1-based.)

   for each d in 1..n//j:

       i = j*d.

       if i >n: break.

       c[i] += mu[d] * dj.

This way, for each i, all j >=2 where j divides i, and d is i/j, we add mu(d) * dj to c[i].

Wait, but how does this work? Because for each j, and each d, we are adding mu(d) * dj to c[j*d], which is i.

But j must be >=2, and for i =j*d, d is a proper divisor of i only if j*d >d. Which is true since j >=2, so j*d >=2*d >=d*2 >=2*1=2. So i =j*d is at least 2, and d is at least 1. So i/d =j >=2. So j*d is a proper divisor (d <i) only if j*d !=d, but j >=2 implies j*d >=2*1=2, and d >=1, so i =j*d >=2, and d can be 1. For example, j=2, d=1: i=2*1=2. Then d=1 is a proper divisor of i=2.

So this approach correctly accumulates all terms mu(d)*d_j into c_i, where j >=2 and d is any integer such that j*d <=n.

This is O(n log n) time, because for each j from 2 to n, the inner loop runs for n//j iterations, which is O(n/2 + n/3 + ...) ~ O(n log n).

Yes, this is manageable for n up to 2e5.

So, the steps to compute c_i:

1. Compute mu for all i.

2. For j from 2 to n:

   dj = b_j - a_j (since for j>=2, the b array is given except for the first element).

   for d in 1 to n//j:

       i = j*d.

       if i >n: break.

       c[i] += mu[d] * dj.

Once c_i is computed for all i, we can split into groups A and B (mu=1 and mu=-1), and precompute their sorted lists and prefix sums.

Now, let's consider the groups:

Group 0: mu[i] is 0. Sum of |c_i| for these i's is precomputed as sum_0.

Group A: mu[i] is 1. Collect all c_i into list A, sort them, compute prefix sum.

Group B: mu[i] is -1. Collect all c_i into list B, sort them, compute prefix sum.

Then, for each query x:

t =x - a_1.

sum_A is sum |c_i + t| for c_i in group A.

sum_B is sum |c_i - t| for c_i in group B.

sum_0 is fixed.

Total is sum_0 + sum_A + sum_B.

So to compute sum_A and sum_B quickly, we can:

For group A:

Sort list A in ascending order.

Compute prefix sums.

For a given t, find the first index in A where c_i >= -t.

sum_less = prefix_sum of elements before index.

count_less = index.

sum_ge = total_sum_A - sum_less.

sum_A = (sum_ge + t * (count_ge)) ) - (sum_less + t * count_less).

Because:

For elements < -t: (c_i + t) is negative. So absolute value is -(c_i +t) = -c_i -t. Summing over these elements gives sum_less_terms = -sum_less - t * count_less.

For elements >= -t: (c_i + t) is positive. Sum is sum_ge_terms = sum_ge + t * count_ge.

sum_A = sum_less_terms + sum_ge_terms.

Which is (-sum_less - t * count_less) + (sum_ge + t * count_ge).

But sum_ge = total_sum_A - sum_less, count_ge = len(A) - count_less.

So:

sum_A = (-sum_less - t * count_less) + (total_sum_A - sum_less + t * (len(A) - count_less)).

Simplify:

sum_A = -sum_less - t*count_less + total_sum_A - sum_less + t * len(A) - t * count_less.

Combine like terms:

sum_A = (total_sum_A) - 2 * sum_less + t*( len(A) - 2 * count_less ) - 2 * t * count_less.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, sum_A can be computed as:

sum_A = sum( (c_i + t) for c_i >= -t ) + sum( -(c_i +t) for c_i < -t )

= sum_ge + t * count_ge - sum_less - t * count_less.

= (sum_ge - sum_less) + t*(count_ge - count_less).

But sum_ge - sum_less = (total_sum_A - sum_less) - sum_less = total_sum_A - 2 * sum_less.

count_ge - count_less = (len_A - count_less) - count_less = len_A - 2 * count_less.

So sum_A = (total_sum_A - 2*sum_less) + t*( len_A - 2 * count_less )

Similarly for sum_B:

sum_B = sum( (t - c_i) for c_i <= t ) + sum( (c_i -t) for c_i > t )

sum( (t - c_i) for c_i <= t ) = t * cnt_leq - sum_leq.

sum( (c_i -t) for c_i > t ) = sum_gt - t * cnt_gt.

sum_B = (t * cnt_leq - sum_leq) + (sum_gt - t * cnt_gt).

But sum_leq + sum_gt = total_sum_B.

cnt_leq + cnt_gt = len_B.

So sum_B = t*( cnt_leq - cnt_gt ) + ( sum_gt - sum_leq ) + ( sum_leq + sum_gt ) - sum_leq - sum_gt ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute:

For group B:

sum_B = sum ( |c_i - t| )

We can find the split where c_i <=t and c_i >t.

sorted B list.

Find the split index where c_i <=t.

sum_leq = prefix_sum up to split.

cnt_leq = split.

sum_gt = total_sum_B - sum_leq.

cnt_gt = len_B - split.

sum_B = (t * cnt_leq - sum_leq) + (sum_gt - t * cnt_gt )

So sum_B = t * (cnt_leq - cnt_gt) + (sum_gt - sum_leq).

So the steps for each group:

For group A:

sorted list is A_sorted, prefix sum array A_prefix.

For a given t, find the first index in A_sorted where c_i >= -t.

sum_less = A_prefix[index].

sum_ge = A_total - sum_less.

sum_A = (sum_ge + t * (len_A - index)) ) - (sum_less + t * index).

Which can be written as (sum_ge - sum_less) + t * (len_A - 2*index).

Similarly for group B.

But how to compute this efficiently?

Yes. Using binary search to find the split points, and precomputed prefix sums.

So, the steps for each query are:

Compute t =x_i - a_1.

Compute sum_0 (precomputed).

For group A:

   Find the split index where A_sorted[i] >= -t.

   sum_less = prefix_A[index].

   count_less = index.

   sum_ge = total_A - sum_less.

   count_ge = len_A - index.

   sum_A = sum_ge + t * count_ge - sum_less - t * count_less.

Which simplifies to (sum_ge - sum_less) + t * (count_ge - count_less).

But since count_ge - count_less = len_A - 2*index.

So sum_A = (total_A - 2*sum_less) + t*( len_A - 2*index )

Similarly for group B.

But perhaps the code is easier to handle with the variables as above.

So in code:

For group A:

sorted_A = sorted list of c_i where mu[i] ==1.

prefix_A = prefix sums of sorted_A.

total_A = prefix_A[-1]

For a query t:

key = -t

split = bisect_left(sorted_A, key)

sum_less = prefix_A[split] if split >0 else 0

sum_ge = total_A - sum_less

count_less = split

count_ge = len(sorted_A) - split

sum_A = sum_ge + t * count_ge - sum_less - t * count_less

Similarly for group B:

sorted_B = sorted list of c_i where mu[i] ==-1.

prefix_B = prefix sums of sorted_B.

total_B = prefix_B[-1]

For a query t:

key = t

split = bisect_right(sorted_B, key)  # because for c_i <=t, use bisect_right to find the insertion point after all elements <=t.

sum_leq = prefix_B[split]

sum_gt = total_B - sum_leq

count_leq = split

count_gt = len(sorted_B) - split

sum_B = (t * count_leq - sum_leq) + (sum_gt - t * count_gt)

So combining all of this.

Now, the steps in code:

First, read the input.

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # a_1, a_2, ... a_n (0-based in the list, but in the problem, it's 1-based)

Wait, the problem says arrays a and b are of size n. The input is a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. So in code, the list a is [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n], but in 0-based indexes, but the code will need to handle 1-based indices. So perhaps it's better to pad the list with a dummy element at index 0.

Similarly for the b array. The third line is the array b, where b_1 is -1 (unknown), and others are given.

So code steps:

Read n.

Read a list as list of integers (assuming 1-based indices, but stored as 0-based in code. Or perhaps better to read them into 1-based arrays.)

But in Python, it's easier to use 0-based. So:

a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # a has n elements, a[0] is a_1, a[1] is a_2, etc.

Wait, no. The input's second line is a_1 to a_n. So the first element of the list is a_1, which is the first element of the array a in the problem.

Wait, in the first example:

Input:

2

3 7

So the a array is [3,7], which represents a_1=3, a_2=7.

So in code, a[0] is a_1, a[1] is a_2.

Similarly for the b array. The third line has b_1=-1, then other elements.

So, code:

a = list(map(int, input().split()))
b = list(map(int, input().split()))

Then, for each j >=2, d_j =b[j-1] -a[j-1], because for j in 1-based notation, the indexes in the list are 0-based. For example, j=2 corresponds to b[1] in the list.

But wait, the third line of input is the list of b_1, b_2, ..., b_n, with b_1 =-1. So in code, b[0] is b_1 (unknown), b[1] is b_2 (given), and so on.

So for j >=2 (1-based j), in code, the index is j-1. So for j in 2..n (1-based), the code's index is 1..n-1.

So, for j in 2..n (1-based), dj is b[j-1] - a[j-1].

But wait, the problem says that for the third line of input, the array b has b_1 =-1. So in code, the list b is [b_1, b_2, ..., b_n]. So for j=2 (1-based), b_2 is the second element in the input list, which is code's b[1].

So yes, for each j in 2..n (1-based), dj = b[j-1] - a[j-1].

Now, code for precomputing mu.

Implement sieve of eratosthenes to compute the Möbius function.

Then compute c_i for all i.

Then split into groups and compute prefix sums.

Let's outline the code.

First, compute the Möbius function:

max_n = 2e5.

n can be up to 2e5.

So for sieve, we can compute the smallest prime factor (spf) for each number up to n. Then compute mu.

Initialize spf as array of size n+1, initialized to 0.

Then for i from 2 to n:

   if spf[i] is 0, it's a prime. Then for all multiples j of i, if spf[j] is 0, set spf[j] =i.

Then, compute mu for each i from 1 to n.

mu = [1]*(n+1)

for i from 2 to n:

   if spf[i//spf[i]] == spf[i]:  # if i has a squared prime factor.

       mu[i] =0

   else:

       mu[i] = -mu[i//spf[i]]

But perhaps a better approach is to factorize each i using spf, check for square factors, and compute mu accordingly.

But for time constraints, perhaps the sieve-based approach is better.

Alternatively, here's another method:

Compute mu[i] as follows:

Initialize mu to 1 for all i.

Then, for each prime p, mark multiples of p^2 as 0.

Then, for each prime p, for multiples of p, multiply mu by -1 if not already marked as 0.

But this is tricky. Alternatively, here's the code to compute mu:

spf = [0]*(n+1)
for i in range(2, n+1):
    if spf[i] ==0:
        spf[i] =i
        for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):
            if spf[j] ==0:
                spf[j] =i

Wait, but this is the standard sieve to compute the smallest prime factor. Once spf is computed, then for each i, we can factorize it into its prime factors, and count the multiplicity.

So for each i, we can compute its prime factors, check if any has multiplicity >=2. If so, mu[i] =0. Otherwise, mu[i] = (-1)^k, where k is the number of distinct primes.

So code:

mu = [1]*(n+1)

for i in range(2, n+1):
    if spf[i] ==0:
        # i is a prime.
        for j in range(i, n+1, i):
            cnt =0
            x =j
            while x %i ==0:
                cnt +=1
                x =x//i
            if cnt >=2:
                mu[j] =0
            else:
                mu[j] *= (-1)
But this approach is O(n log n), but for n=2e5, it's manageable.

Alternatively, for each i from 2 to n:

   if i is a prime (spf[i] ==i):

       for j in multiples of i:

           if j is divisible by i^2:

               mu[j] =0

           else:

               mu[j] *= -1

But I think this is incorrect. For example, for j=6 (factors 2 and 3). Each prime divides j once. So mu[6] is 1 * (-1) * (-1) =1.

But the sieve approach would correctly compute mu[6] as 1.

But implementing this might be complex.

Alternatively, here's the code for the factorization-based approach:

mu = [1]*(n+1)
is_prime = [True]*(n+1)
is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
for p in range(2, n+1):
    if is_prime[p]:
        for multiple in range(p, n+1, p):
            is_prime[multiple] = False if multiple !=p else True
        for multiple in range(p, n+1, p):
            cnt =0
            x = multiple
            while x %p ==0:
                cnt +=1
                x =x//p
            if cnt >=2:
                mu[multiple] =0
            else:
                mu[multiple] *= -1

But this is not correct, as it would multiply by -1 for each prime factor.

Alternatively, for each i from 2 to n:

   if i is divisible by p^2 for any prime p, mu[i] =0.

   else, mu[i] = (-1)^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors.

So, to compute mu[i], for each i, we can factorize it into primes, check if any exponent >=2. If yes, mu is 0. Else, count the number of primes and multiply by (-1)^k.

So for code, factorization using spf array.

So code:

spf = [0]*(n+1)
for i in range(2, n+1):
    if spf[i] ==0:
        spf[i] =i
        for j in range(i*i, n+1, i):
            if spf[j] ==0:
                spf[j] =i

mu = [1]*(n+1)
for i in range(2, n+1):
    x =i
    factors = set()
    flag =False
    while x !=1:
        p = spf[x]
        if p in factors:
            flag =True
            break
        factors.add(p)
        x =x//p
    if flag or x !=1:  # x!=1 indicates that after dividing by p, there's a factor left.
        # check if any exponents are >=2
        # but this is not correct. Let's think.

    else:
        # factors contains distinct primes.
        k = len(factors)
        mu[i] = (-1)**k
    # else, mu[i] remains 1?

Wait, no. Maybe this approach is not correct.

Alternative approach for mu[i]:

For each i from 1 to n:

   if i ==1: mu[i] =1.

   else:

       x =i

       res =1

       while x !=1:

           p = spf[x]

           cnt =0

           while x %p ==0:

               cnt +=1

               x =x//p

           if cnt >=2:

               res =0

               break

           else:

               res *= -1

       mu[i] = res

Yes, this code will correctly compute mu[i].

Because for each prime factor p, if it appears once, multiply by -1. If any p appears more than once, set mu to 0.

So this code correctly computes mu.

Yes.

So the code for mu is:

Compute spf array.

Then, for each i from 1 to n:

   if i ==1:

       mu[i] =1

   else:

       x =i

       res =1

       flag = False

       while x !=1:

           p = spf[x]

           cnt =0

           while x %p ==0:

               cnt +=1

               x =x//p

           if cnt >=2:

               res =0

               flag =True

               break

           res *= -1

       if not flag:

           mu[i] = res

       else:

           mu[i] =0

This will correctly compute mu for all i.

Now, once we have mu, we can proceed.

Next step: compute c_i for each i.

We need to compute for each i, sum over d divides i, d !=i: mu(d) * d_{i/d}.

But i/d is j, which must be >=2 (since d is a proper divisor of i, so i/d >=2 implies d <=i/2. Wait, no. For example, i=6, d=3. i/d=2. So j=2.

So for each j >=2, and for each d >=1 such that i =j*d <=n, we add mu(d) * d_j to c[i].

So code:

Initialize c as a list of zeros with size n+1 (since i is up to n).

Then, for j in 2 to n (1-based j):

   dj = b[j-1] - a[j-1]  # because the input b array has b[0] =-1 (b_1), b[1] is b_2, etc.

   for d in 1 to n//j:

       i =j*d

       if i >n: break

       c[i] += mu[d] * dj

So in code:

c = [0]*(n+1)

for j in range(2, n+1):

   # since j is 1-based here.

   # in code, j is 1-based (since the problem's j is 1-based for the array b).

   # but the code's a and b are 0-based.

   # j in 2..n (1-based) corresponds to the code's index j-1.

   # So, in code:

   b_j = b[j-1]

   a_j = a[j-1]

   dj = b_j - a_j

   # then for each d in 1 to (n) //j:

   max_d = n //j

   for d in range(1, max_d+1):

       i =j *d

       if i >n:

           break

       c[i] += mu[d] * dj

Yes.

Once c is computed, we can split into groups.

sum_0 = sum of abs(c[i]) for i in 1..n where mu[i] ==0.

Group A is all c[i] where mu[i] ==1.

Group B is all c[i] where mu[i] ==-1.

We need to collect these groups, sort them, and compute prefix sums.

In code:

group_A = []
group_B = []
sum_0 =0

for i in range(1, n+1):

   m = mu[i]

   if m ==0:

       sum_0 += abs(c[i])

   elif m ==1:

       group_A.append(c[i])

   elif m ==-1:

       group_B.append(c[i])

Then, sort group_A and group_B, compute prefix sums.

sorted_A = sorted(group_A)

prefix_A = [0]*(len(sorted_A)+1)

for i in range(len(sorted_A)):

   prefix_A[i+1] = prefix_A[i] + sorted_A[i]

total_A = prefix_A[-1]

sorted_B = sorted(group_B)

prefix_B = [0]*(len(sorted_B)+1)

for i in range(len(sorted_B)):

   prefix_B[i+1] = prefix_B[i] + sorted_B[i]

total_B = prefix_B[-1]

Then, for each query:

read x_i.

t =x_i - a[0]  # since a[0] is a_1.

sum_total = sum_0

For group A:

key = -t

split = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_A, key)

sum_less = prefix_A[split]

sum_ge = total_A - sum_less

count_less = split

count_ge = len(sorted_A) - split

sum_A = sum_ge + t*count_ge - sum_less - t*count_less

sum_total += sum_A

For group B:

key = t

split = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_B, key)

sum_leq = prefix_B[split]

sum_gt = total_B - sum_leq

count_leq = split

count_gt = len(sorted_B) - split

sum_B = (t * count_leq - sum_leq) + (sum_gt - t * count_gt)

sum_total += sum_B

Print sum_total.

So that's the code.

Second query x=4:

t=4-3=1.

group A:

key=-t =-1.

bisect_left(sorted_A [0], -1) returns 0.

sum_less=0.

sum_ge=0.

count_less=0.

sum_A=0 + 1*1 -0 -0 =1.

group B:

key=1.

bisect_right(sorted_B [-2], 1) → split=1.

sum_leq=prefix_B[1] =-2.

sum_gt=0.

count_leq=1.

sum_B= (1*1 - (-2)) + (0 -1*0) → (1 +2) +0=3.

sum_total=0+1+3=4. Correct.

Third query x=3:

t=0.

group A:

key=0.

bisect_left(sorted_A [0], 0) returns 0.

sum_less=0.

sum_ge=0.

count_less=0.

sum_A=0 +0*1 -0 -0=0.

group B:

key=0.

bisect_right(sorted_B [-2], 0) returns 1.

sum_leq=prefix_B[1]=-2.

sum_gt=0.

sum_B= (0*1 - (-2)) + (0 -0*0) → 2 +0=2.

sum_total=0+0+2=2. Correct.

So the code works for this sample.

Another sample:

Input 2:

6

2 5 4 1 3 6

-1 4 6 2 3 5

3

1

8

4

Output:10,29,9.

But let's skip detailed testing.

Now, code considerations:

- Precompute the spf array.

- Handle the groups.

- Use bisect module for binary search.

So, the code in Python:

But note that in Python, list indices are 0-based, and for the a and b arrays, the problem's 1-based index is handled by code's 0-based lists.

Now, putting it all together.
