Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the minimum number of points to remove so that the remaining points have a diameter (max distance between any two) not exceeding d. Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the problem is about selecting a subset of points where the maximum difference between any two is <=d, and we want the largest possible such subset. Because the minimal removals correspond to the maximal subset we can keep. So the answer is n minus the size of the largest valid subset.

So the key is to find the maximum number of points that can form a group with diameter <=d. Then subtract that from n to get the answer.

How do we find that maximum subset? Well, since the diameter is the maximum difference between any two points in the subset, the optimal way is to sort the points and then look for the longest possible window where the first and last elements differ by <=d. Because when sorted, the maximum difference is between the first and last in the window. So any subset can be considered in a sorted manner, and the maximum subset would be a consecutive sequence in the sorted array.

Wait, right. So the approach should be: sort the array, then for each possible window [i..j], check if a[j] - a[i] <=d. The largest such window's length is the maximum number of points we can keep. Then the minimal removal is n minus that length.

That makes sense. Because once the array is sorted, the longest possible contiguous subarray where the first and last elements are within d of each other will give the maximum number of points that can be kept. Any other arrangement would not have a longer sequence since the sorted array allows the maximum possible spread to be captured in a window.

So the steps are:

1. Sort the array of points.
2. Find the maximum length of a subarray where the last element minus the first is <=d.
3. The answer is n minus that maximum length.

For example, in the third sample input:

Original points: 1,3,4,6,9,10. Sorted. Then looking for the longest window where last - first <=3.

Looking at possible windows:

The window starting at 3 (index 1) and ending at 6 (index 3) is 3,4,6. 6-3=3, which is allowed. Length 3.

But wait, maybe a longer window. Let's see:

Looking at 3,4,6. Then 3,4,6,9? 9-3=6 which is over. Hmm. So the maximum window is 3,4,6 (length 3), which gives a required removal of 6-3=3, so answer is 6-3=3. Which matches the sample.

So yes, the approach would work.

So the plan is:

- Sort the list.
- For each possible starting index i, find the maximum j where a[j] - a[i] <=d. Then the length is j-i+1. Keep track of the maximum such length.

How to efficiently find j for each i?

Since the array is sorted, for each i, we can perform a binary search to find the largest j where a[j] <= a[i] +d. That's O(n log n) time.

Alternatively, since the array is sorted, we can use a sliding window approach. Start with i=0, j increases as much as possible until a[j] -a[i] >d. Then increment i and repeat. But the sliding window approach can be O(n) time.

But given that n is up to 100, even O(n^2) is acceptable. Because 100^2 is 10,000, which is negligible for Python's speed. So even if we do a linear scan for each i, it's manageable.

But for optimization, let's think about the sliding window approach.

Wait, here's how the sliding window works:

Initialize left=0. For each right in 0..n-1:

While a[right] - a[left] >d, increment left. Then the current window is from left to right, and the length is right-left+1. Keep track of the maximum.

But wait, this approach would work because the array is sorted. For each right, the left is the smallest index where a[right] -a[left] <=d. So the window [left, right] is the largest possible window ending at right. Then the maximum of all such windows would be the answer.

Yes, that's correct. So this approach would find the maximum length in O(n) time.

So implementing this would be efficient.

So the steps are:

Sort the array.

Initialize left=0, max_length=1 (since even a single point is allowed).

Loop right from 0 to n-1:

   while a[right] - a[left] >d:

       left +=1

   current_length = right - left +1

   if current_length > max_length:

       max_length = current_length

So the maximum_length is the largest possible subset size. Then the answer is n - max_length.

Yes, that's the way to go.

Now, handling the case when d=0. For example, all elements must be the same. The sliding window approach will work here as well, because when a[right] -a[left] is 0, which is <=d=0. So the code would count consecutive elements equal to a[left]. Wait, but in the sorted array, duplicates are consecutive. So for d=0, the longest window of the same elements. Which is correct.

So this approach covers all cases.

Now, let's code this.

First, read n and d. Then the list of x's.

Sort the list.

Handle the edge case when n=0, but according to constraints, n>=1. So no problem.

Initialize left=0, max_len=0.

But wait, for n=1, the max_len would be 1. Which is correct.

So code outline:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, d = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    x = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))
    x.sort()

    max_len = 0
    left = 0

    for right in range(n):
        while x[right] - x[left] > d:
            left +=1
        current_len = right - left +1
        if current_len > max_len:
            max_len = current_len

    print(n - max_len, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
3 0
7 7 7
""",
            "output": \
"""\
0
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Testing against sample input 2.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n, d = map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())
    x = list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split()))
    x.sort()

    max_len = 0
    left = 0

    for right in range(n):
        while x[right] - x[left] > d:
            left +=1
        current_len = right - left +1
        if current_len > max_len:
            max_len = current_len

    print(n - max_len, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
6 3
1 3 4 6 9 10
""",
            "output": \
"""\
3
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Third sample:

Points sorted: [1,3,4,6,9,10], d=3.

Let's see how the sliding window works.

Initialize left=0.

right=0: 1-1=0 â‰¤3 â†’ len 1.

right=1: 3-1=2 â‰¤3 â†’ len 2. left remains 0.

right=2:4-1=3 â†’ len3. left=0.

right=3:6-1=5>3 â†’ enter loop.

Increment left to 1. x[3] -x[1] =6-3=3 â‰¤3. So len=3 (3,4,6 â†’ indexes 1,2,3). current_len=3. max_len=3.

right=4:9. Check x[4] -x[1] =9-3=6>3. So left increments to 2. x[4]-x[2]=9-4=5>3 â†’ left increments to3. x[4]-x[3]=9-6=3 â‰¤3. current_len=2 (indexes 3,4). max_len remains 3.

right=5:10. x[5]-x[3] =10-6=4>3 â†’ increment left to4. x[5]-x[4]=1 â†’ len=2. max_len remains 3.

So max_len is3. So answer is6-3=3. Which matches the sample.

So the code works for all samples.

So this approach is correct.

Now code this in Python.

Edge cases to test:

n=1, d=0 â†’ must return 0.

Another case: n=2, d=0. Points 1 and 2 â†’ sorted. The maximum subset can be 1, but we have to remove one. So answer is 1.

But according to code, for right=0, left=0. current_len=1. For right=1, x[1]-x[0] =1>0 â†’ left becomes 1. current_len=1. So max_len=1. answer is 2-1=1. Correct.

Another test case: n=4, d=2. Points sorted: 1,2,3,4. The maximum window is 1,2,3 (diff 3-1=2). len 3. So answer 4-3=1.

The code will find this. For right=2 (3), x[2]-x[0] =2 <=2 â†’ len3. Then right=3:4-1=3>2 â†’ left increments until x[3]-x[left] <=2. left becomes 1:4-2=2 â†’ len3. So maximum is3. So answer1.

Yes.

Thus, the code is correct.
</think>

```python
n, d = map(int, input().split())
x = list(map(int, input().split()))
x.sort()
max_len = 0
left = 0

for right in range(n):
    while x[right] - x[left] > d:
        left += 1
    current_len = right - left + 1
    if current_len > max_len:
        max_len = current_len

print(n - max_len)
```
