Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read it carefully.

So, the problem is about permutations. We have a permutation p of length n and a positive integer k. We need to find a permutation q such that for any i < j, p_{q_i} <= p_{q_j} + k. And among all possible such permutations q, we have to find the one with the minimum number of inversions.

Hmm. The key here is understanding the constraints on q. The condition p_{q_i} <= p_{q_j} +k for all i < j. Let's think about what this implies for the order of elements in q.

Wait, since i < j, the condition must hold for every pair. So for any two elements in q where i is before j, the p-value of q_i can be at most p-value of q_j plus k. That's a bit tricky. So, the ordering in q has to ensure that the elements are arranged such that no earlier element's p is too much larger than a later element's p.

Let me try to model this. Let's consider the permutation q as a sequence of elements. For each element in q, when placed in position i, all elements after it (positions j > i) must have p-values at least p_q_i -k. Because for those j, i < j, so p_{q_i} <= p_{q_j} +k → p_{q_j} >= p_{q_i} -k. Wait, no. Wait, the condition is p_q_i ≤ p_q_j +k. So for j > i, p_q_j can be as small as (p_q_i -k). So the p values of the elements after i can't be less than p_q_i -k. Because if they are, then the condition would be violated. Wait, no. Wait, let's say j is after i. Then the condition is p_{q_i} <= p_{q_j} +k. So, if p_{q_j} is less than (p_{q_i} -k), then p_{q_i} would be larger than p_{q_j} +k, which violates the condition. So in that case, such a j would not be allowed to come after i. So, for all j that come after i in q, their p must be >= p_{q_i} -k.

Wait, no. Wait, the condition is that for all i < j, p_{q_i} <= p_{q_j} +k. So rearranged, p_{q_j} >= p_{q_i} -k. So, any element that comes after i in q must have a p value that is at least p_{q_i} -k. Otherwise, the condition is violated.

So, this seems like a constraint on the order of elements. So, when building the permutation q, once we choose to place an element x in a certain position, all elements that come after it must have p values >= p_x -k.

But how do we model this constraint for the entire permutation?

This feels like an ordering problem where certain elements must come before or after others based on their p values. But how can we model this to find the permutation q that satisfies all these constraints and has the minimal number of inversions?

An inversion in q is a pair i < j where q_i > q_j. So, the goal is to arrange the elements in q in such a way that the constraints are met and the number of such inversions is as small as possible.

Hmm. Since inversions are minimized when the permutation is as sorted as possible, perhaps the minimal inversion count corresponds to arranging q in a way that's as close to increasing order as possible, but respecting the constraints.

So the problem reduces to finding the permutation with the least possible inversions that satisfies the given condition.

Now, how to model this. Let's think of the elements in terms of their p-values. Let's sort the elements in some way such that for each element x, all elements after x in the permutation have p values >= p_x -k.

But what's the best way to arrange them to minimize inversions?

Let's think of this as a graph problem. Each element has to come after certain elements. For example, if element a has a p value that's too low, then elements that have p value higher than a's p +k must come before a. Wait, no. Wait, if we have two elements x and y. Suppose x is placed before y in q. Then p_x <= p_y +k must hold. If x is placed after y, then y must be placed before x, so p_y <= p_x +k. But in this case, if p_x is much larger than p_y, then placing x after y would require p_y <= p_x +k. Which is always true since p_x is larger than p_y. Wait, because p_x is larger than p_y, then p_y <= p_x +k is automatically true. So if x is placed after y, that's allowed. But if x is placed before y, then p_x must be <= p_y +k. So the constraint between x and y is that if x comes before y, then p_x <= p_y +k. But if x comes after y, then p_y <= p_x +k must hold. Wait, no. Because if x is after y, then y comes before x, so the condition for i < j is that p_{q_i} <= p_{q_j} +k. So in the case where x is after y, q_i is y, q_j is x. So the condition is p_y <= p_x +k. So when x is after y, this condition must hold.

Wait, but for any pair (i,j) where i < j in q, the condition applies. So for any two elements, x and y, their relative order in q determines which condition applies. So if x comes before y, then p_x must be <= p_y +k. If y comes before x, then p_y must be <= p_x +k.

So for each pair x and y, the relative order in q must satisfy whichever condition applies. So for example, if p_x > p_y +k and p_y > p_x +k is impossible (since k is positive), then one of the orders is allowed. Wait, but if p_x is more than p_y +k, then if x is placed before y, the condition would fail. So in such a case, x cannot be placed before y. Therefore, y must be placed before x. But if x is placed after y, then the condition for y and x is p_y <= p_x +k. Since p_x is larger than p_y +k, then p_x is larger than p_y, so p_y <= p_x +k is automatically true. Because p_x >= p_y +k +1 (if p is integer), then p_y <= p_x +k is true. So in this case, x must come after y.

So the constraints between pairs can be modeled as follows: for any x and y, if p_x > p_y +k, then x cannot come before y. So the order must have y before x.

But if p_x <= p_y +k and p_y <= p_x +k, then either order is allowed.

Wait, for example, if p_x is 5 and p_y is 3, and k is 2. Then p_x (5) is <= 3 +2 =5 → yes. So x can come before y. Then for the other condition, if y comes before x, then p_y must be <= p_x +k → 3 <=5+2 → 7, which is true. So in this case, both orders are allowed.

So in such cases, the decision of ordering x before y or y before x is possible, and we have to choose the order that leads to the minimal number of inversions.

But in cases where one of the pair's order is forced, like when p_x > p_y +k, then y must come before x.

So the problem requires that the permutation q must be a linear extension of a certain partial order. The partial order is defined by the constraints that for any x and y, if p_x > p_y +k, then y must come before x.

So the first step is to model this partial order and then find a linear extension of this partial order that has the minimal number of inversions. The minimal inversion count is the minimal possible.

But how do we compute this efficiently?

The key is to model this as a DAG where each edge represents a required order (y must come before x if p_x > p_y +k). Then, the problem reduces to finding a topological order of this DAG with the minimal number of inversions compared to the original permutation's indices. Wait, no. Wait, the permutation q is a permutation of 1..n, but perhaps the original permutation p is different. Wait, no. The permutation p is given, and q is a permutation of the same indices. Wait, the problem says that p is a permutation of length n, and q is a permutation of length n. So the elements of q are the elements 1 to n, arranged in some order. So q is a permutation of [1..n], and for each i < j, p_{q_i} <= p_{q_j} +k.

The problem is to arrange the elements (1..n) in the order q such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the number of inversions in q is minimized.

An inversion in q is a pair (i,j) where i < j but q_i > q_j. So the goal is to arrange the elements in such a way that the constraints are met and the number of such inversions is as small as possible.

So the problem is similar to finding a linear extension of a certain partial order (the constraints) with the minimal number of inversions. But how?

An alternative approach is to model this as a dynamic programming problem. Since the constraints are that certain elements must come before others, the order in which elements are placed can be determined based on their p-values and the constraints.

Let's think about the elements sorted in some way. For example, if we process elements in the order of their p-values. But with the constraints that when placing an element, all elements that come after must have p >= p_x -k. Hmm, but that's not directly applicable.

Wait, the constraints are that for any element x in the permutation, all elements after x must have p >= p_x -k. Because for i < j, x is at i and y is at j, so p_x <= p_y +k → p_y >= p_x -k.

So the elements after x must have p >= p_x -k. So when building the permutation, each element added to the permutation must satisfy that all elements after it have p >= (current element's p) -k.

But how to model this. Perhaps the optimal approach is to arrange the elements in a certain order where the p-values are non-decreasing as much as possible, but with some flexibility.

Wait, but when you arrange elements in non-decreasing order of p, the minimal inversions would be zero (if possible). But since the constraints may require certain elements to come before others even if their p values are higher, this may not be possible.

Alternatively, let's think of grouping elements into blocks where within each block, the elements can be ordered in a way that minimizes inversions, but such that the blocks are ordered in a way that satisfies the constraints.

Alternatively, we can model this problem as a graph where each node represents an element, and there is an edge from y to x if x must come after y (because p_x > p_y +k). Then, the permutation q must be a topological sort of this graph. The goal is to find the topological sort with the minimal number of inversions.

But how to compute that. The problem is that the minimal inversions topological order is not straightforward. Because the inversion count depends on the original indices. Wait, no. The inversion count in q is the number of pairs (i,j) where i < j but q_i > q_j. So the inversion count is the number of such pairs in the permutation q.

But the elements in the permutation q are the original elements (indices of p) arranged in a certain order. So for example, if the original elements are [1,2,3], and q is [3,2,1], that's a permutation with 3 inversions.

So the inversion count is based on the numerical values of the elements in q. So the problem is to arrange the elements (the numbers 1..n) in a permutation q that satisfies the constraints and has as few inversions as possible (i.e., the permutation is as close to the identity permutation as possible).

So the goal is to arrange the elements in a way that they are as "sorted" as possible (i.e., in ascending order) while respecting the constraints.

This suggests that the problem can be modeled using dynamic programming, where the state represents the current elements that have been placed and the constraints that must be followed for the remaining elements.

But with n up to 5000, a standard O(n^3) DP approach would be too slow. So we need a more efficient approach.

Alternative approach:

Let's consider that the constraints can be represented as a DAG where each node is an element, and there's an edge from a to b if a must come before b (i.e., p_b > p_a +k). So for all pairs (a, b) where p_b > p_a +k, a must come before b. For other pairs, there is no such constraint.

The problem is to find a topological order of this DAG that has the minimal number of inversions. Because the minimal inversion count is achieved when the permutation is as close as possible to the identity permutation (since inversions are counted based on the actual values of the elements in q).

Wait, but the identity permutation may not be a valid topological order. So the idea is to arrange the elements in a way that's as close as possible to the identity permutation (i.e., the order 1,2,3,...n) but respecting the constraints that certain elements must come before others.

But how to model this. For example, if element 5 must come before element 3 (because p_3 > p_5 +k), then in the permutation q, 5 must come before 3, even though 5 is larger than 3, which introduces an inversion. But to minimize inversions, we need to find the arrangement that, while respecting all such constraints, has the least possible inversions.

This sounds like a problem where we can model the elements as needing to be ordered in a way that satisfies the constraints, but as much as possible maintaining their original order (1,2,3,...n). Because the original order (the identity permutation) has zero inversions, and any deviation from it increases inversions. So the minimal inversion permutation under constraints is the one that is as close as possible to the identity permutation, but respecting the constraints.

This problem is known as the "minimum feedback arc set" problem, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's the problem of finding the permutation that is a linear extension of the DAG and is as close as possible to the identity permutation in terms of inversion count.

This problem seems similar to scheduling jobs with constraints, where the objective is to minimize the number of inversions compared to a given order (the identity permutation here). 

An approach to this problem could be a greedy algorithm. For each step, choose the next element in the permutation that can be placed (i.e., all elements that must come before it have already been placed) and which, when placed, contributes the least to the inversion count.

But with n=5000, a greedy approach may not work, or may not be efficient enough.

Alternative idea: For each element, we can precompute the set of elements that must come before it. Then, the problem is to arrange the elements in an order where each element is placed only after all required predecessors, and the order of elements not constrained is such that their relative order is as per the identity permutation to minimize inversions.

But how to model this. Let's think in terms of the constraints. For any two elements x and y:

If x must come before y (because p_y > p_x +k), then x is placed before y.

If there's no constraint between x and y (i.e., p_x <= p_y +k and p_y <= p_x +k), then the order between x and y is flexible. However, to minimize inversions, if x < y in the original indices, we should place x before y to avoid an inversion. But if the constraints don't require a particular order, then placing x before y (if x < y) is better to avoid inversions.

Wait, because in the original identity permutation, x comes before y if x < y. So if we can place x before y without violating any constraints, that's optimal. But when there's a choice between x and y (no constraints), and x < y, placing x before y reduces inversions. Conversely, if x > y, then placing x after y would be better (since x > y, so if x is after y, that's an inversion. Wait, no. If x is after y and x > y, then (y, x) is a pair where y < x and in the permutation, y comes first. So that's not an inversion. Wait, the inversion count is the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j and q_i > q_j. So if the original indices are x and y, with x < y, then in the permutation q, if x comes after y, that's an inversion (since x < y in index, but in q, their positions are j and i where j > i, but q_i = y, q_j = x. Since y > x (since x < y in index), then q_i > q_j. So it's an inversion. So in this case, placing x before y avoids an inversion.

Thus, when there is no constraint between x and y, it's better to arrange them in their original order (smaller index first) to avoid inversions.

But when there's a constraint that y must come before x (because p_x > p_y +k), then even if x < y, x is placed after y, causing an inversion. So in such cases, we have to accept the inversion to satisfy the constraints.

So the key is to model all the required constraints and then arrange the elements in such a way that they are as close as possible to the original order (minimizing inversions), subject to the constraints.

So the algorithm should be:

1. For all pairs (x, y), determine if x must come before y (if p_y > p_x +k) or y must come before x (if p_x > p_y +k). 

Wait, no. Wait, if x must come before y if p_y > p_x +k. Because if x is before y, then p_x <= p_y +k must hold. If p_y > p_x +k, then x cannot be before y. So y must come before x. Wait, no. Wait, if x is placed before y, then the condition is p_x <= p_y +k. If p_y > p_x +k, then p_x <= p_y +k is true. Wait, no. Wait, if p_y is greater than p_x +k, then p_x <= p_y +k is obviously true. Because p_x +k < p_y implies that p_x < p_y. So p_x is less than p_y. Then p_x <= p_y +k is certainly true. So the condition p_x <= p_y +k is automatically satisfied in that case. Wait, this is confusing. Let me re-express the constraints:

For any i < j in q (the permutation), the condition is that p_{q_i} <= p_{q_j} +k. 

So, if we have two elements a and b. Let's say in permutation q, a comes before b. Then, we must have p_a <= p_b +k. 

But if a comes after b, then p_b <= p_a +k must hold.

So the constraints are between the elements in the permutation. The order of a and b determines which condition must be satisfied. So, for the pair (a, b), the possible orderings are:

Either a comes before b, and p_a <= p_b +k must hold.

Or b comes before a, and p_b <= p_a +k must hold.

So for each pair (a, b), exactly one of these two conditions must be true. Wait, no. If both conditions are possible, then either order is allowed. For example, if p_a = 3, p_b = 5, and k=2. Then for a before b: 3 <=5+2 → yes. For b before a:5 <=3+2 → 5 <=5 → yes. So either order is allowed.

But if, say, p_a = 5 and p_b =3, and k=1. Then for a before b:5 <=3+1 → 5 <=4 → no. So a cannot be before b. So in that case, b must come before a. Because if a is placed before b, the condition is violated. So for this pair, the only possible order is b before a.

So, the constraints for the pair (a, b) are:

If p_a > p_b +k → then a cannot be before b. So b must come before a.

If p_b > p_a +k → then b cannot be before a. So a must come before b.

Otherwise, either order is possible.

So the problem requires that the permutation q is such that for any pair (a, b), if a is placed before b, then p_a <= p_b +k. Similarly, if b is placed before a, then p_b <= p_a +k.

So the constraints are that certain pairs must be ordered in a specific way.

So, the first step is to model the constraints. For each pair (a, b), if p_a > p_b +k → then a must come after b. Similarly, if p_b > p_a +k → then b must come after a.

But these are two separate possibilities. So, for all pairs (a, b), if p_a > p_b +k → a must come after b. Similarly, if p_b > p_a +k → b must come after a.

But it's possible for both to be true. For example, if p_a is 10, p_b is 5, and k is 3. Then p_a > p_b +k (5+3=8 <10 → yes), and p_b > p_a +k (5 > 13 → no). So in this case, a must come after b.

But if p_a is 10 and p_b is 4, k=3. Then p_a > p_b +k → 4+3=7 <10 → yes. p_b > p_a +k →4>13 → no. So again, a must come after b.

Wait, but if a and b are such that p_a > p_b +k and p_b > p_a +k → that's impossible. Because p_a > p_b +k → p_a >= p_b +k +1 (since p is a permutation, so all are distinct integers). Then p_b > p_a +k → substituting p_a >= p_b +k+1 → p_b > (p_b +k+1) +k → p_b > p_b +2k +1 → 0>2k+1 → which is impossible for k>=1.

So for any pair (a, b), exactly one of the following can be true:

- a must come after b (if p_a > p_b +k)

- b must come after a (if p_b > p_a +k)

- neither (if p_a <= p_b +k and p_b <= p_a +k)

So, the DAG of constraints is built such that for each pair (a, b), if p_a > p_b +k, then we have a directed edge from b to a (since b must come before a). Similarly, if p_b > p_a +k, then we have a directed edge from a to b (a must come before b). Otherwise, no edge is present between them, and they can be ordered freely.

Once the DAG is built, the permutation q must be a topological sort of this DAG. The problem is to find the topological sort with the minimal number of inversions (compared to the identity permutation).

Now, the challenge is to compute this minimal inversion count efficiently, given that n can be up to 5000 and k up to 8.

But n is 5000, which is manageable only if the algorithm is O(n^2) or O(nk) with k=8.

Hmm. Let's think about possible algorithms.

An approach used in similar problems is dynamic programming, where the state represents the current set of placed elements and the remaining elements. But with n=5000, that's impossible.

Alternative idea: Since the DAG is built based on the p values, perhaps there's a way to order the elements in a certain way and greedily arrange them with minimal inversions, considering the constraints.

Wait, since the constraints are based on the p values, perhaps we can sort the elements by their p values. But the inversion count is based on their original indices, not their p values. So this complicates things.

Alternatively, let's consider that for elements with similar p values (differing by at most k), they can be arranged in any order. So, perhaps the problem can be broken down into layers where each layer consists of elements with p values in a certain range, and the layers are ordered in a way that higher layers can't have elements from lower layers placed after them. Wait, but the constraints are more complex.

Alternatively, since k is small (up to 8), maybe there's a way to group elements based on their p values and process them in batches where the constraints between batches are enforced.

But I'm not sure. Let's think of the problem in terms of the DAG. Each element can have certain predecessors that must come before it, and certain successors that must come after it.

The minimal inversion permutation would be the topological order that is as close as possible to the identity permutation. So, for each step, choose the element with the smallest possible index (to avoid inversions) among those that can be placed next (i.e., all their predecessors in the DAG have been placed already).

This is known as the lexicographically smallest topological order. But the minimal inversion count isn't necessarily the same as the lex order. For example, choosing the smallest possible index first may lead to more inversions later.

Alternatively, this is similar to scheduling jobs with precedence constraints, and the objective is to minimize the sum of completion times. But that's a different problem.

Wait, the problem of finding a topological sort that is as close as possible to a given order (identity permutation here) is a known problem. One approach is to use a priority queue where at each step, the next element is the smallest possible (in the desired order) among all elements with in-degree zero in the current DAG.

This is called the greedy algorithm for lexicographical smallest topological order. But this approach may not yield the minimal inversion count. However, it's a possible heuristic.

But in this case, since the minimal inversion count is desired, perhaps using the greedy approach of selecting the smallest possible available element (in terms of original index) would give the minimal inversions. Because placing the smallest elements first minimizes the number of larger elements that come after them, thus reducing inversions.

But how can we be sure that this approach leads to the minimal inversion count?

Alternatively, let's model this as a dynamic programming problem. For each subset of elements placed so far, track the minimal number of inversions. But with n=5000, this is impossible.

Another idea is to model the problem as follows: For each element, the order in which it's placed affects the inversion count. For example, placing element x before any elements y where x < y reduces inversions, but if x must be placed after certain elements due to constraints, this may not be possible.

But given that the constraints form a DAG, perhaps the minimal inversion permutation is the one that arranges the elements in the DAG's topological order, choosing at each step the element with the smallest possible index among the available choices (those with all dependencies met). This is similar to the lexicographical topological sort, but with the index as the priority.

Let's think about this. For each step in building the permutation, we can choose any element that has all its required predecessors already placed. Among these, choosing the one with the smallest index will place it as early as possible, which could minimize the number of elements that come after it and are smaller (which would create inversions). 

This approach would greedily select the smallest possible available index at each step. Let's see if this works for the sample inputs.

Sample Input 2:

3 1

p is [2,3,1]

So the elements are 1, 2, 3 (indices) with p values 2,3,1.

So, for each pair:

Check if a must come before b or vice versa.

For elements 1 and 2:

p_1=2, p_2=3. For any order, check if the condition holds.

If 1 is placed before 2: 2 <=3+1 → 2 <=4 → yes. So allowed.

If 2 is placed before 1: 3 <=2+1 →3 <=3 → yes. So allowed.

So no constraints between them.

For elements 1 and 3:

p_1=2, p_3=1. 

If 1 is placed before 3: 2 <=1+1 →2 <=2 → yes.

If 3 is before 1: 1 <=2+1 →1 <=3 → yes. So no constraints.

For elements 2 and 3:

p_2=3, p_3=1. 

If 2 is before 3:3 <=1+1 →3 <=2 → no. So this is not allowed.

So 2 cannot be before 3. Therefore, 3 must be before 2.

So the constraints are that 3 must come before 2.

Now, according to the greedy approach:

Available elements are those with all dependencies met. The elements not yet placed are 1, 2, 3. The dependencies are 3 must come before 2.

So available elements are 1 and 3 (since 3 has no dependencies, and 1 has none). Choose the smallest index, which is 1. Place 1 first.

Now, remaining elements are 2 and 3. The available elements are 3 (since 2 requires 3 to be placed first). So place 3 next. Then place 2. The permutation is [1,3,2], which has 1 inversion (3 and 2). Which matches the sample output.

So the greedy approach works here.

Sample Input 3:

5 2

p is [5,4,3,2,1]. The elements are indices 1 to 5.

Let's compute the constraints for each pair.

For example, between 1 (p=5) and 2 (p=4). 

p_1=5, p_2=4. If 1 is placed before 2: 5 <=4+2 →5 <=6 → yes. So allowed. If 2 is placed before 1:4 <=5+2 →4 <=7 → yes. So no constraints between 1 and 2.

But for pair 1 and 3 (p=3):

If 1 is before 3:5 <=3+2 →5 <=5 → yes. Allowed.

If 3 is before 1:3 <=5+2 → yes. Allowed. So no constraints.

Similarly, between 1 and 4 (p=2):

5 <=2+2 →5<=4 → no. So 1 cannot be before 4. Therefore, 4 must be before 1.

Similarly, for 1 and 5 (p=1):

5 <=1+2 →5<=3 → no. So 1 cannot be before 5. So 5 must be before 1.

For element 2 (p=4) and others:

With 3 (p=3): 4 vs 3+2=5. 4 <=5 → allowed either way. 3 <=4+2 →3<=6 → allowed either way. So no constraints.

2 and 4 (p=2): 4 vs 2+2=4. 4 <=4 → yes. So allowed. Either order.

2 and 5:4 <=1+2 →4 <=3 → no. So 2 cannot be before 5. So 5 must be before 2.

For element 3 (p=3) and 4 (p=2):3 vs 2+2=4 →3 <=4 → allowed. If 4 is before 3:2 <=3+2 → yes. So allowed either way.

3 and 5 (p=1):3 <=1+2 → yes. So allowed. If 5 is before 3:1 <=3+2 → yes. So no constraints.

For element 4 (p=2) and 5 (p=1): 2 <=1+2 → yes. Allowed. Either order.

So the constraints are:

4 must come before 1.

5 must come before 1.

5 must come before 2.

Other elements can be ordered as needed.

So the available elements initially are 3,4,5 (since 4 has no constraints except perhaps others). But let's see:

- For 1: must have 4 and 5 come before it.

- For 2: must have 5 come before it.

- 3: no constraints.

So the initial available elements are 3,4,5 (assuming their dependencies are met). Wait, but 4 has no dependencies. So available elements are 3,4,5.

The greedy approach would pick the smallest index among these, which is 3. Place 3.

Next available elements: 4,5 (since 3 is placed). Place 4 (smaller than 5).

Then place 5. Now, 5 must be placed before 1 and 2. Then, elements 1 and 2 are available (their dependencies are met: 4 and 5 are placed before 1; 5 is placed before 2).

So next available elements are 1 and 2. Greedy picks 1. Place 1. Then 2. So permutation is [3,4,5,1,2]. Which has 6 inversions. Which matches the sample.

So the greedy approach seems to work here.

So perhaps the correct approach is to model the DAG of required precedence constraints and then find the topological order that is lexicographically smallest in terms of the original indices. Because that would place the smallest possible elements first, thus minimizing the number of inversions.

But how to verify this for all cases.

Let's think of another example.

Suppose n=4, k=1.

p = [4,3,2,1]. So elements 1 (p=4), 2 (3), 3 (2),4 (1).

The constraints:

For any pair a and b:

If a is before b: p_a <= p_b +1.

Else: p_b <= p_a +1.

For example, element 1 (p=4) must be placed after elements whose p is <=4-1=3. So any element with p <=3 must be placed after 1? Or wait, no. If a comes after b, then for a to come after b, the condition is that p_b <= p_a +k. So for example, if element 1 (p=4) is placed after element 2 (p=3), then 3 <=4 +1 →3 <=5 → yes. So allowed.

But if element 1 is placed before element 2, then 4 <=3+1 →4 <=4 → yes. So allowed.

So the constraints between 1 and 2 are no constraints.

But between 1 and 4 (p=1):

If 1 is placed before 4:4 <=1 +1 →4 <=2 → no. So 1 cannot be placed before 4. So 4 must be placed before 1.

Similarly, between 2 and 4: p_2=3, p_4=1. 3 >1+1 →3>2. So 2 cannot be placed before 4. So 4 must be placed before 2.

Similarly, between 3 and 4: p_3=2 <=1+1 → yes. So no constraints.

So the constraints are: 4 must come before 1, 2, and possibly others.

Let's see the dependencies:

- 1 must come after 4.

- 2 must come after 4.

- 3 can be placed before or after 4.

So available elements initially are 3 and 4 (since 3 has no dependencies, and 4 has no dependencies).

The greedy approach would choose 3 (index 3) first, then 4 (index 4), then 1 (index 1), then 2 (index 2). The permutation is [3,4,1,2]. The inversion count is between 3 and 4 (3 <4 → no inversion), 3 and 1 (3>1 → inversion), 3 and 2 (3>2 → inversion), 4 and 1 (4>1 → inversion), 4 and 2 (4>2 → inversion), 1 and 2 (1<2 → no). So total inversions: 4.

But what if we choose 4 first, then 3, then 2, then 1? The permutation is [4,3,2,1], which has 6 inversions. That's worse.

Alternatively, if we choose 4 first, then 3, then 1, then 2: permutation [4,3,1,2]. Inversions: 4>3, 4>1,4>2, 3>1,3>2, 1<2 → total 5 inversions. Still worse.

But if we place 3 first, then 4, then 1, 2 → 4 inversions. Which is better.

But what if another order exists. Like [4,3,2,1] → 6 inversions. No.

So the greedy approach of choosing the smallest available index first gives 3, then 4, then 1, then 2, leading to 4 inversions. Is there a better permutation?

Let's see: What if we arrange 3,4,2,1? Wait, but 2 must come after 4. So permutation [3,4,2,1]. This is allowed. The inversion count is 3 inversions (3>2, 3>1,4>2,4>1,2>1 → 5 inversions).

Hmm, perhaps the greedy approach isn't optimal here. Wait, but according to the constraints, 2 must come after 4, but in the permutation [3,4,2,1], 2 is placed after 4, so it's allowed.

But according to the greedy approach, after placing 3 and 4, the available elements are 1 and 2. The smallest index is 1. So the permutation is [3,4,1,2]. Which has 4 inversions (3 and 1, 3 and 2,4 and 1,4 and 2 → 4 inversions).

But what if we choose 2 before 1? After placing 3 and 4, can we choose 2 next? No. Because 2 has a dependency on 4 being placed before, which is satisfied. So yes. So available elements are 1 and 2. So the greedy approach would choose the smallest index, which is 1, not 2. So the permutation would be 3,4,1,2.

So in this case, the greedy approach gives a better inversion count than other possible permutations. 

So perhaps the greedy approach works here.

But how to model this for the general case.

The algorithm would be:

1. Build the DAG based on the constraints. For each element a, collect all elements b that must come before a (i.e., p_a > p_b +k → b must come before a).

2. For each element, track the number of dependencies (in-degree) in the DAG. 

3. Use a priority queue (min-heap) to select the next element to place. The priority is the element's index. Initially, elements with in-degree zero are added to the heap.

4. While the heap is not empty:

   a. Extract the element with the smallest index (x).

   b. Add x to the permutation.

   c. For each element y that has a directed edge from x to y (i.e., y must come after x), decrement their in-degree. If the in-degree of y becomes zero, add y to the heap.

This process builds the permutation in a way that at each step, the smallest possible available element (by index) is chosen. This should minimize the number of elements that are smaller than x and come after x in the permutation, thus minimizing inversions.

But to compute the number of inversions in the resulting permutation, we need to process the permutation and count the number of pairs (i,j) where i < j and q_i > q_j.

But for n=5000, this is O(n^2), which is 25 million operations. Which might be acceptable for Python in 2 seconds. But with n=5e3, it's 5e3^2=25e6 operations, which is manageable.

Alternatively, we can compute the number of inversions during the permutation construction using a Fenwick tree (Binary Indexed Tree), which allows O(n log n) inversion count calculation.

Yes, using a Fenwick tree is the way to go.

The Fenwick tree approach for counting inversions works as follows:

As we build the permutation q element by element, for each element x in q, we insert it into the Fenwick tree and query the number of elements already in the tree that are greater than x. This gives the number of elements that were added before x but have a larger value than x, contributing to inversions.

The total sum of these counts gives the inversion count.

So, combining the two steps:

1. Generate the permutation q using the greedy topological sort (smallest index first).

2. Compute the inversion count of q using a Fenwick tree.

Now, the problem reduces to implementing this approach.

But first, we need to model the DAG correctly.

So, steps for implementation:

1. Read n and k.

2. Read the permutation p as a list. Note that the elements of p are distinct and form a permutation of 1..n.

3. For each element x (which is an index from 1 to n), compute the set of elements that must come before x. For each other element y:

   If p[x] > p[y] +k → x must come after y. So y must be in the set of elements that must come before x.

   Similarly, if p[y] > p[x] +k → y must come after x, so x must come before y. But in this case, x must be in the set of elements that must come before y.

   So for each pair (x, y):

   if p[x] > p[y] +k → add an edge from y to x (y must be before x).

   if p[y] > p[x] +k → add an edge from x to y (x must be before y).

   Otherwise, no edge.

But for n=5000, this is O(n^2) operations, which is 25 million for n=5e3, which may be acceptable in Python for a problem with time limit 2 seconds.

But with n=5e3, it's O(25e6) operations. Python can handle that, but perhaps we can optimize.

Alternative idea: For each x, find all y where p[y] < p[x] -k. Because for those y, p[x] > p[y]+k → x must come after y.

Similarly, find all y where p[y] > p[x] +k → those y must come after x.

So for each x, iterate through all other elements and check these conditions.

But again, this is O(n^2) time.

But with n=5e3, this is 25 million operations. Let's see:

Each iteration involves checking two conditions for each pair (x, y). But perhaps this can be optimized.

But given the problem's constraints, and given that k is up to 8, perhaps there's a way to pre-sort the elements and find their neighbors efficiently.

Let's think: for each element x, p[x] is known. For x to have edges from y where p[y] < p[x] -k.

So for all y where p[y] < p[x] -k, add an edge y → x.

Similarly, for all y where p[y] > p[x] +k, add an edge x → y.

To find these y for each x efficiently, perhaps we can sort the elements by their p values and use binary search.

For example, sort the elements in a list sorted_p, where each entry is (p_value, index). Then for each x, the elements y with p[y] < p[x]-k can be found in O(log n) time.

But for each x, how many elements y satisfy p[y] < p[x] -k? It depends on the p values.

But even if we use this approach, it's O(n log n) time for each x, leading to O(n^2 log n) time, which is worse than O(n^2). So this may not be helpful.

But given that k is small (up to 8), perhaps for each x, we can iterate through all elements y with p[y] in certain ranges.

Alternatively, since k is small, perhaps there's a way to precompute for each x the elements y that are p[x] -k < p[y] < p[x] +k. But not sure.

But in any case, for n=5e3, O(n^2) is manageable in Python if optimized.

So, the code steps:

Implement the DAG:

- For each x in 1..n:

   For each y in 1..n where x != y:

      if p[x] > p[y] +k:

         add an edge y → x.

      elif p[y] > p[x] +k:

         add an edge x → y.

But wait, this would process each pair twice. So for x and y, when x < y:

We check if p[x] > p[y] +k → add edge y →x.

Then, when processing y and x, we check if p[y] > p[x]+k → add edge x → y.

But this would process each pair twice. So to optimize, we can loop over all pairs (x, y) where x < y and check both conditions.

Alternatively, loop over all x in 1..n, and for each y in 1..n where y !=x, check the conditions.

But this is O(n^2) time.

Now, let's proceed.

Once the DAG is built, we can compute the in-degree for each node and build the adjacency list.

Then, using a priority queue (min-heap) to select the next node with the smallest index among those with in-degree zero.

Once the permutation is built, we compute the inversion count using a Fenwick tree.

Now, let's test this approach on the sample input 2:

Sample Input 2:

3 1

p = [2, 3, 1]

Indices are 1, 2, 3. p[1]=2, p[2]=3, p[3]=1.

Processing pairs:

For x=1:

Check y=2: p[1]=2, p[2]=3. 2 <=3+1 → yes. 3 <=2+1 →3<=3 → yes. So no edges between 1 and 2.

y=3: p[3]=1. 2 >1+1 →2>2 → no. So no edge. So no edge from 3 to 1. Also, 1>3's p +k is 2>1+1 → 2>2 → no. So no edge from 3 to 1 or 1 to 3.

For x=2:

y=1: already processed.

y=3: p[2]=3, p[3]=1. 3>1+1 →3>2 → yes. So edge from 3 to 2. Also, since p[3] is 1, which is not greater than p[2]+k (3+1=4), no edge from 2 to 3.

So, for x=2, y=3: add edge from 3 to 2.

For x=3:

y=1 and y=2: already processed.

So, the edges are 3→2.

The in-degree for 1 is 0, for 2 is 1 (from 3), for 3 is 0.

The initial available nodes are 1 and 3. The heap contains 1 and 3. The smallest is 1. Place 1.

After processing 1, look at its outgoing edges. 1 has no edges. So nothing is done.

Next, available nodes are 3. Place 3. Process outgoing edges (3→2). Decrement in-degree of 2 to 0. Add 2 to the heap.

Place 2. Heap is now empty.

Permutation is [1,3,2].

Inversion count: (3,2) → 1 inversion. Correct.

So the approach works.

Now, the code implementation.

Implementing the DAG:

But for n=5000, building adjacency lists for all possible edges would require O(n^2) memory. For example, for each node, storing a list of all nodes it has edges to. For n=5e3, this could be 5e3 * 5e3 = 25e6 entries, which is manageable in Python.

But in practice, for each x, the edges would be added to x's adjacency list. For each x, we can collect all y where x must come before y (i.e., edges x → y).

Wait, no. For example, if p[x] > p[y] +k → x must come after y. So add an edge y → x.

So for each such pair (y, x), add an edge from y to x.

Thus, for each x, we need to collect all y where p[y] +k < p[x]. So for x's in-degree, it's the number of y where p[x] > p[y] +k.

Similarly, if p[y] > p[x] +k → add edge x → y. So x must come before y.

So for x, its adjacency list includes all y where x must come before y.

Thus, to build the adjacency list:

For each x in 1..n:

   for each y in 1..n where y !=x:

      if p[x] > p[y] +k → add y →x edge.

      elif p[y] > p[x] +k → add x →y edge.

But checking all pairs.

But for n=5e3, this is O(n^2) =25 million operations, which may be manageable.

But with Python's loops being slower, perhaps this would be tight. So we need to optimize this.

Alternative approach:

Precompute for each x the list of y where p[y] < p[x] -k (add edge y→x).

And for each x, the list of y where p[y] > p[x] +k (add edge x→y).

So for each x, we can iterate through all other elements y and check these conditions.

But again, O(n^2) time.

But in Python, perhaps it's possible. Let's see.

The code for building the adjacency list and in-degrees:

Initialize in_degree as a list of zeros for each node.

adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]  # 1-based indexing.

Then, for each x in 1..n:

   for each y in 1..n:

      if x == y:

         continue

      if p[x-1] > p[y-1] +k:

         adj[y].append(x)  # add edge y →x.

         in_degree[x] +=1

      elif p[y-1] > p[x-1] +k:

         adj[x].append(y)  # add edge x →y.

         in_degree[y] +=1

But wait, this will process each pair twice. For example, x=1, y=2 and x=2, y=1. So for the same pair (1,2), it will check both directions. Which is redundant.

But with n=5e3, this is 25 million iterations, which may be slow in Python.

Alternative approach: iterate over all pairs (x, y) where x < y.

For each such pair:

   if p[x] > p[y] +k:

      add edge y →x. (x must come after y)

      in_degree[x] +=1

      if p[y] > p[x] +k:

         # impossible since p[x] > p[y]+k implies p[y] +k < p[x] → p[y] < p[x] -k. So p[y] can't be > p[x] +k.

         pass

   elif p[y] > p[x] +k:

      add edge x →y. (y must come after x)

      in_degree[y] +=1

   else:

      # check both conditions

      if p[x] > p[y] +k:

          add edge y →x. in_degree[x] +=1

      elif p[y] > p[x] +k:

          add edge x →y. in_degree[y] +=1

      else:

          # no edge

          pass

Wait, no. The initial approach of checking all pairs is better.

But for each pair (x, y) where x < y, check both directions.

For example:

for x in 1..n:

   for y in x+1..n:

      check if p[x] > p[y] +k → add edge y →x, increase in_degree[x].

      check if p[y] > p[x] +k → add edge x →y, increase in_degree[y].

But this way, each pair is processed once. So for n=5e3, this is 5e3 *5e3 / 2 → ~12.5e6 iterations.

Which is manageable.

So code:

for x in range(1, n+1):

   for y in range(x+1, n+1):

      px = p[x-1]

      py = p[y-1]

      if px > py +k:

          adj[y].append(x)

          in_degree[x] +=1

      if py > px +k:

          adj[x].append(y)

          in_degree[y] +=1

This way, each pair is processed once, and the code is O(n^2) but with half the iterations.

This should save time in Python.

Now, after building the adj and in_degree, the next step is to perform the topological sort with priority queue.

The code for the topological sort:

import heapq

heap = []

for x in 1..n:

   if in_degree[x] == 0:

      heapq.heappush(heap, x)

permutation = []

while heap:

   x = heapq.heappop(heap)

   permutation.append(x)

   for y in adj[x]:

      in_degree[y] -=1

      if in_degree[y] ==0:

         heapq.heappush(heap, y)

Once permutation is built, compute the inversion count.

To compute inversion count using Fenwick Tree:

The Fenwick tree will track the elements we've added so far. For each element x in permutation, we want to know how many elements already added are larger than x. The sum of these counts is the inversion count.

The Fenwick tree can be 1-based. The elements are the indices in the original permutation (1..n). For each x, when we insert x into the Fenwick tree, we query the sum from x+1 to n. This gives the number of elements already present that are larger than x.

So the code for Fenwick Tree:

class FenwickTree:

    def __init__(self, size):

        self.n = size

        self.tree = [0]*(self.n +1)

    def update(self, index, delta):

        while index <= self.n:

            self.tree[index] += delta

            index += index & -index

    def query(self, index):

        res =0

        while index >0:

            res += self.tree[index]

            index -= index & -index

        return res

Then, compute inversion count:

ft = FenwickTree(n)

inv_count =0

for x in permutation:

    # query the number of elements already added that are > x → which is (total added so far) - query(x)

    # since the Fenwick tree is 1-based, query(x) returns the sum up to x.

    # elements larger than x are from x+1 to n.

    # sum of elements from x+1 to n is (current count in tree) - query(x)

    current_count = ft.query(n) - ft.query(x)

    inv_count += current_count

    ft.update(x, 1)

return inv_count

Putting it all together.

Now, test the code on sample input 3:

Sample Input 3:

5 2

p = [5,4,3,2,1]

Indices 1-5 have p values 5,4,3,2,1.

So processing pairs (x < y):

For example, x=1 (p=5) and y=2 (p=4):

5 >4+2 →5>6 → no. 4>5+2 →4>7 → no. So no edges.

x=1 and y=3 (p=3):

5>3+2 →5>5 → no. 3>5+2 → no. So no edges.

x=1 and y=4 (p=2):

5>2+2 →5>4 → yes. Add edge from 4 to 1. So in_degree[1] increases by 1.

y=4's p is 2. 2>5+2 → no. So no edge from 1 to 4.

x=1 and y=5 (p=1):

5>1+2 →5>3 → yes. Add edge from 5 to 1. in_degree[1] +=1.

1's p is 5. 1>5+2 → no. So no edge from 1 to 5.

Similarly, for x=2 (p=4):

y=3 (p=3): 4>3+2 →4>5 → no. 3>4+2 → no. No edges.

y=4 (p=2): 4>2+2 →4>4 → no. 2>4+2 → no. No edges.

y=5 (p=1):4>1+2 →4>3 → yes. Add edge from 5 to 2. in_degree[2] +=1.

Similarly, x=3 (p=3):

y=4 (p=2):3>2+2 →3>4 → no. 2>3+2 → no. No edges.

y=5 (p=1):3>1+2 →3>3 → no. 1>3+2 → no. No edges.

x=4 (p=2):

y=5 (p=1):2>1+2 →2>3 → no. 1>2+2 → no. No edges.

So the edges added are:

For x=1:

edges from 4 and 5 to 1.

For x=2:

edge from 5 to 2.

Other pairs:

x=2, y=5 → edge from 5 to 2.

So the in_degree for 1 is 2 (from 4 and 5), in_degree for 2 is 1 (from 5). Others have in_degree 0.

The initial heap will have 3,4,5 (since their in_degree is zero).

The smallest index is 3. Place 3.

Process its outgoing edges. adj[3] is empty.

Next, heap has 4,5. Place 4. Process its outgoing edges. adj[4] has 1. Decrement in_degree[1] from 2 to 1. Not zero.

Next, heap has 5. Place 5. Process adj[5], which has edges to 1 and 2. Decrement in_degree[1] to 0, in_degree[2] to 0.

Add 1 and 2 to the heap. The heap now has 1 and 2. Smallest is 1. Place 1. Process adj[1], which has no edges.

Heap now has 2. Place 2. Process adj[2], which has no edges.

Permutation is [3,4,5,1,2]. inversion count is 6, which matches the sample.

Thus, the code works.

Now, code implementation.

But for n=5000, the code must be efficient. Let's ensure that the data structures are implemented optimally.

Also, the Fenwick tree must be implemented efficiently.

Now, putting it all together:

Read n and k.

Read the list p as a list of integers.

Build the adjacency list and in_degree.

Then, perform the topological sort using a heap.

Then, compute the inversion count.

Now, code:

Testing against sample input 1.

Sample Input 4:

10 3

5 8 6 10 2 7 4 1 9 3

Code should generate the permutation with 18 inversions.

Thus, this code should work.
