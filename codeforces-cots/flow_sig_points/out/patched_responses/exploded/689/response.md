Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of pairs (i, j) where i < j, and the frequency of ai in the prefix up to i is greater than the frequency of aj in the suffix starting at j. Hmm. So for each element ai, we need to calculate how many times it has appeared from the start up to i (including i), and for each aj, how many times it appears from j to the end. Then we need to count all pairs i < j where the first count is greater than the second.

First, I need to figure out how to compute the f(1, i, ai) for all i efficiently. Similarly, compute f(j, n, aj) for all j. That's the starting point. Let's think about that.

For the prefix frequencies, I can iterate from left to right, keeping a frequency map. For each position i, the count is the number of times ai has appeared up to i. So as I go through the array, for each element, I increment its count in the map. Then for each i, f(1,i,ai) is the current count of ai.

Similarly, for the suffix frequencies, I can iterate from right to left, maintaining another frequency map. For each j, f(j, n, aj) is the count of aj from j to the end. So starting from the end, for each element, increment its count and store the count for each j.

Once I have these two arrays (prefix_counts and suffix_counts), the problem reduces to finding all pairs i < j where prefix_counts[i] > suffix_counts[j].

But how to compute this efficiently?

The naive approach would be to compare every i < j pair, but with n up to 1e6, that's O(n^2) which is way too slow. So we need a smarter way.

The key is to process the suffix_counts and for each i, find the number of j's greater than i where suffix_counts[j] is less than prefix_counts[i]. But how to do this efficiently.

Let's think about the data structures involved. Let's say we process each j and store their suffix_counts in a structure that allows us to query, for a given value x, how many entries are less than x. Then, for each i in order, after processing all j's > i, we can query the structure for the count of suffix_counts[j] < prefix_counts[i], and sum those counts. Wait, but how to process the j's in a way that for each i, j is > i?

Alternatively, since j must be greater than i, perhaps we can process the suffix_counts in a way that allows us to compute, for each possible i, the number of j's > i with suffix_counts[j] < prefix_counts[i].

Let me think: the order of processing could be such that we iterate i from 0 to n-1, and for each i, we have all j's > i. So if we can, for each i, have a structure that contains all suffix_counts[j] for j > i, then query how many of those are less than prefix_counts[i]. The sum of all those queries would be the answer.

But how to build this structure. Since j must be greater than i, for each i, the j's considered are those from i+1 to n-1. So the structure must contain all j's > i. So if we process the i's in reverse order (from n-2 down to 0), and insert the j's (i+1) into the structure as we go, then for each i, the structure contains exactly the j's > i. That makes sense.

So here's the plan:

1. Precompute prefix_counts and suffix_counts arrays.
2. Initialize a frequency array or a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) or a Binary Indexed Tree that can handle queries of the form "number of elements <= x". Alternatively, a Binary Indexed Tree that can count elements less than a given value, but since the possible counts can be up to n (since each count is the number of occurrences in a prefix/suffix, which could be up to n, but in practice for each element, the count is the number of times it's in the prefix up to i. For example, if all elements are the same, then prefix_counts[i] = i+1. So the maximum possible value in prefix_counts is up to 1e6. Similarly for suffix_counts.

So the possible values for suffix_counts[j] are up to 1e6. So if we can map these values to a compressed index, then use a Fenwick Tree that can track the frequency of each value and allow us to query the sum of frequencies for all elements less than x.

So here's the approach:

- Compute suffix_counts for all j.
- As we iterate i from n-1 down to 0 (or i from 1 to n in 1-based), for each i, the j's that are valid are those j > i. So for each i, after processing i+1, we need to have all j's from i+1 to n added into the structure. Wait, no. Let's think of processing the i's in the order from right to left (i starts at n-2, then n-3, etc., down to 0). For each i, the j's > i are i+1, i+2, ..., n-1. So as we process i, we can have a data structure that contains all j's > i. How to build this? Let's see: initially, the data structure is empty. We start processing from i = n-1, then n-2, etc. For each i, before processing i, we need to have the j's in the structure being those j > i. Wait, when i is processed, the j's are j > i. So when i is processed, we can add j = i+1 (but wait, j must be > i. So when i is processed, j can be i+1 and onwards. But how to collect all j's greater than i. Maybe the correct approach is to iterate i from right to left (i starts at n-1, then n-2, etc.), and for each i, the j's that are valid are j > i. So for each i, after processing i+1, we need to add the j=i+1 into the data structure, then query the structure for the number of elements less than prefix_counts[i]. Wait, no. Because when i is processed, j can be any j > i. So if we process i in the order from right to left, then for i = n-1, there are no j's (since j must be > i, but i is the last index). For i = n-2, j can be n-1. So when we process i, we first add j=i+1 to the data structure, then query the data structure for the count of elements less than prefix_counts[i]. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think:

Start with i = n-1. Since j must be > i, there's no j. So the data structure is empty. So the answer contribution for i =n-1 is zero.

Then i =n-2. We need to consider j =n-1. So first, we add j =n-1's suffix_count into the data structure. Then, for i =n-2, prefix_counts[i] is the count of a[i] in the prefix up to i. Then, we query the data structure for the number of elements in it (which is 1, since we added j=n-1) where suffix_counts[j] < prefix_counts[i]. So that's the contribution to the answer for i =n-2.

Then i =n-3: we first add j =n-2, then j =n-1 (but wait, no. How are the j's added? Because when processing i in reverse order (from n-1 down to 0), perhaps for each i, when we process i, we first add the j=i+1's suffix_counts into the data structure, then query for the current prefix_counts[i]. Because j must be > i. So for example:

Processing order:

i =n-1: no j's. So no addition to the structure. answer is 0.

Then, i =n-2: add j =n-1 (since j =n-1 > i =n-2). Then query how many elements in the structure have suffix_counts[j] < prefix_counts[i]. Then that's the count for this i.

Then, i =n-3: add j =n-2's suffix_count, then query for prefix_counts[i].

Wait, no. Because when i is n-3, j can be n-2, n-1. But in the previous steps, when i was n-2, we added j =n-1. So how to collect all j's >i?

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to iterate i from right to left (from n-1 down to 0), and as we process each i, we add the j=i's suffix_count to the data structure. Wait, but j has to be greater than i. So j can't be i. Wait, no. For example, when i is being processed, the j's that are valid are those j > i. So when processing i, all j's that are j > i are already in the data structure. So how do we ensure that the data structure contains all j's >i?

Let me think again. Let's imagine that the data structure starts empty. We process the i's in reverse order, starting from i =n-1, then i =n-2, down to i=0. For each i, after processing it, we add the j=i+1's suffix count into the data structure. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because when i is n-2, j can be n-1 (which is i+1). But when i is n-3, j can be n-2, n-1, etc.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to process i from n-1 down to 0. For each i, the j's that are valid are those j >i. So when processing i, the j's that are already in the data structure are the ones with j >i. How? Because when we process i, any j that is greater than i would have been processed in the previous steps. Wait, no. Let me think: when processing i, we first compute the answer for i, then add j=i's suffix count to the data structure. Wait, that can't be right. Because j has to be greater than i, so j can't be i.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

For each j from 0 to n-1 (assuming 0-based), we need to collect the suffix_counts[j], and for each i < j, check if prefix_counts[i] > suffix_counts[j]. So the total answer is the sum over all j of the number of i < j where prefix_counts[i] > suffix_counts[j].

So this is equivalent to, for each j, count the number of i < j where prefix_counts[i] > suffix_counts[j]. Then sum all these counts.

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

So the problem reduces to, for each j, compute how many elements in the prefix_counts array (from 0 to j-1) are greater than suffix_counts[j].

The sum over all j of this count is the answer.

So now the problem is transformed into: for each j, count the number of elements in the array prefix_counts[0..j-1] that are greater than a certain value (suffix_counts[j]). Then sum all these counts.

Now, how to compute this efficiently.

If we can process each j, and for each j, query the number of elements in the prefix_counts array up to j-1 that are greater than suffix_counts[j], then the sum of all these is the answer.

The way to compute this is to process the elements in order, maintaining a data structure that allows us to query the number of elements greater than a certain value in the data structure.

But since the j's are processed in order from 0 to n-1, and for each j, we need to query the elements before j, we can build a structure incrementally. For example, after processing j, we add prefix_counts[j] to the structure. Then, for the next j+1, when we need to query the elements before j+1 (which includes j, j-1, etc.), but wait, no: for j+1, the elements are 0 to j, so we can build the structure by adding elements as we process them.

Wait, let's think again: For each j, the elements we need to consider are all i < j, i.e., prefix_counts[0] to prefix_counts[j-1]. So for j=0, there's no elements. For j=1, the elements are prefix_counts[0]. For j=2, elements are 0 and 1, etc.

So we can process j from 0 to n-1, and for each j, we first query the data structure for the number of elements > suffix_counts[j], then add prefix_counts[j] to the data structure. Because when processing j, the elements in the data structure are the prefix_counts[0] to prefix_counts[j-1], which are exactly the i < j elements.

Wait, no. Because for j=0, when we process j=0, there's nothing in the data structure. Then, after processing j=0, we add prefix_counts[0] to the data structure. Then for j=1, we query the data structure (which contains prefix_counts[0]) and check how many are > suffix_counts[1]. Then add prefix_counts[1] to the data structure, and so on. So yes, this approach would work.

So the steps would be:

1. Compute prefix_counts and suffix_counts for all elements.
2. Initialize a data structure that can track the elements added and allows querying the count of elements greater than a certain value.
3. For each j from 0 to n-1:
   a. Before adding prefix_counts[j] to the data structure, query the data structure for the number of elements > suffix_counts[j]. Sum this into the answer.
   b. Add prefix_counts[j] to the data structure.
   
But wait, the order is: for j, the suffix_counts[j] is the value to compare against the elements in the data structure, which are prefix_counts[0], ..., prefix_counts[j-1]. But according to this approach, when processing j, the data structure contains prefix_counts[0], ..., prefix_counts[j-1], because we add prefix_counts[j] after the query. So for j=0, the query is done before adding anything, which is correct (no elements). Then for j=1, the data structure has prefix_counts[0], which is correct. So yes, this approach would work.

So the key is to process j in order, and for each j, query the current data structure (which contains all i < j) for the count of elements greater than suffix_counts[j], then add prefix_counts[j] to the data structure.

So the problem now reduces to efficiently implementing this.

The challenge is to implement a data structure that can handle up to 1e6 insertions and 1e6 queries, each query being the count of elements greater than a certain value.

What data structures allow this? A Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree) or a Segment Tree, both of which can handle these operations in O(log M), where M is the maximum possible value in the elements.

But the possible values in prefix_counts can be up to 1e6 (since each prefix count is the number of occurrences up to that point, which for a single element could be up to n). Similarly for suffix_counts.

So we need to map the possible values to a compressed range to make the Fenwick Tree feasible. Let's see. The possible values in prefix_counts are from 1 to n (since for the first occurrence of an element, the count is 1, then increases). So the maximum possible value is n. The same for suffix_counts.

So the values can be up to 1e6. But for n=1e6, a Fenwick Tree with 1e6 elements is feasible. But perhaps even better to compress the values. However, since the maximum possible is 1e6, which is manageable (as each node in the Fenwick Tree is O(1) in memory), the total memory would be acceptable.

Alternatively, we can collect all possible values of prefix_counts and suffix_counts, sort them, assign ranks, and then use the compressed ranks. But perhaps it's easier to use the values directly.

Wait, but the Fenwick Tree is 1-based. So when using a Fenwick Tree to track the frequencies, the elements must be in a range that can be mapped to indices. So for example, if the maximum possible value is 1e6, then the Fenwick Tree can have size 1e6 +1, and for a query of x, we can compute the number of elements greater than x as sum from x+1 to max_val.

But how?

The Fenwick Tree can track the frequency of each value. So when we add a value v, we update the frequency at index v. Then, the number of elements greater than x is the sum of frequencies from x+1 to max_val.

But for that, we need to know the maximum possible value. The maximum possible value in prefix_counts is up to n (since each element's count can be as high as n). Similarly, the suffix_counts can be up to n.

So the maximum possible x in the queries (suffix_counts[j]) is up to n. So the Fenwick Tree needs to handle values up to n. So the size of the Fenwick Tree is O(n).

But n can be up to 1e6, which is manageable. Each node in the Fenwick Tree is a 4-byte integer, so 1e6 elements would take 4MB, which is acceptable.

So here's the plan:

1. Compute the prefix_counts and suffix_counts arrays.

For prefix_counts:
- Initialize a dictionary (frequency map) to track counts as we iterate from left to right. For each element in the array, increment its count in the map, and assign prefix_counts[i] to the current count.

For suffix_counts:
- Similarly, iterate from right to left, track counts, and assign suffix_counts[j] to the current count for each element.

2. Initialize a Fenwick Tree that can track the frequency of elements and allow sum queries for a range.

3. Iterate over each j from 0 to n-1 (0-based indices):
   a. For the current j, query the Fenwick Tree for the sum of elements greater than suffix_counts[j]. This gives the number of elements in the data structure (i.e., prefix_counts for i < j) that are greater than suffix_counts[j].
   b. Add this count to the answer.
   c. Insert prefix_counts[j] into the Fenwick Tree by updating the frequency.

So the Fenwick Tree needs to support two operations:
- Update: increment the frequency of a value v.
- Query: sum of frequencies from l to r.

In this case, the query needed is the sum of frequencies where value > x. So the query is from x+1 to max_val.

The Fenwick Tree can compute the sum from 1 to x (inclusive) using a prefix sum. Then, the sum from x+1 to max_val is total_elements (sum from 1 to max_val) minus sum from 1 to x.

But wait, the Fenwick Tree here is tracking the frequencies. So the sum from 1 to x is the number of elements <=x. The total elements in the tree is the sum from 1 to max_val. Therefore, the number of elements >x is sum_total - sum_1_to_x.

But the total elements in the tree is the same as the number of elements inserted so far. Wait, no. Because each insertion increases the frequency of a particular value by 1. So the sum_total is the total number of elements inserted so far. So for each j, when we query, the sum_total is the number of elements in the Fenwick Tree (i.e., j elements, since we've processed j elements from 0 to j-1). Wait, no. Because when j=0, we process j=0, which requires checking the Fenwick Tree (which is empty) then adding prefix_counts[0]. For j=1, we process j=1: query the Fenwick Tree (which has one element, prefix_counts[0]), then add prefix_counts[1]. So for j, the Fenwick Tree contains j elements after processing j (after adding prefix_counts[j]). So during the processing of j, the Fenwick Tree contains the elements from prefix_counts[0] to prefix_counts[j-1], which are j elements. So the sum_total for the query during j is j elements (since before adding prefix_counts[j], the Fenwick Tree has j elements). So the query for j is: how many elements in the Fenwick Tree (of size j) are > suffix_counts[j].

But according to the plan, for each j, before adding prefix_counts[j], we query the Fenwick Tree. So during processing j, the Fenwick Tree has the elements from 0 to j-1. So for j=0, the Fenwick Tree is empty. For j=1, the Fenwick Tree has the elements from 0 (j=0). So the plan is correct.

Now, the Fenwick Tree needs to support the following operations:

- Update: add 1 to the count at position v (since each element is inserted once, so when we insert a value v, we increment the frequency at v by 1).
- Query: sum of frequencies for values in [x+1, max_val], which can be computed as total_elements_so_far - sum_frequencies_up_to_x.

The total_elements_so_far is equal to the sum of all frequencies, which is the same as the number of elements inserted so far. So for each query, we can compute it as:

sum_greater = total_elements - fenwick.query(x)

Where fenwick.query(x) returns the sum of frequencies up to x.

So the Fenwick Tree needs to support querying up to x.

So the Fenwick Tree's query function returns the sum from 1 to x. Then, sum_greater is (current_total) - query(x).

But the current_total is the number of elements inserted so far. However, since each insertion is a single element (each prefix_counts[j] is added once), the current_total is j during the processing of j. Because before processing j, we have added j elements (from 0 to j-1). So when processing j, the current_total is j.

Wait, no. For j=0: before processing, we have 0 elements. Then, after the query (which is 0), we add prefix_counts[0], so current_total becomes 1. Then j=1: before processing, current_total is 1 (elements 0), then after query, add prefix_counts[1], current_total becomes 2, etc. So during processing j, the current_total is j (since j runs from 0 to n-1). Because when j=0, before adding, the current_total is 0. Then, after adding, current_total is 1. But for j=0, the query is for the elements before j, which is none (since j=0 has i<j=0, which is none). Wait, this suggests that the code is correct.

But perhaps during processing j, the current_total is the number of elements in the Fenwick Tree, which is j (since we process j in order 0 to n-1, and for each j, before adding, the Fenwick Tree has j elements. Because for j=0, after adding, the Fenwick Tree has 1 element. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's think:

Processing each j in 0-based order:

For j=0:

- Before adding, the Fenwick Tree is empty. So current_total is 0.

- We query for the number of elements in the Fenwick Tree (0) that are greater than suffix_counts[0]. The answer is 0.

- Then we add prefix_counts[0], so the Fenwick Tree now has 1 element (value of prefix_counts[0]).

For j=1:

- Before adding, the Fenwick Tree has 1 element (from j=0).

- Query the Fenwick Tree for elements > suffix_counts[1]. The answer is sum_greater = current_total (1) - fenwick.query(suffix_counts[1]).

- Then add prefix_counts[1], so the Fenwick Tree has 2 elements.

So yes, the current_total is j during the processing of j. Because for j=0, current_total is 0. For j=1, current_total is 1.

So the sum_greater for j is (j) - fenwick.query(suffix_counts[j]).

But how to track the current_total. Since each insertion adds exactly one element (each prefix_counts[j] is added once), the current_total is simply the number of insertions done so far, which is j. Because during processing j, we have done j insertions (0 to j-1).

Yes. So when processing j, the current_total is j. So sum_greater = j - fenwick.query(x), where x is suffix_counts[j].

So the Fenwick Tree needs to support query(x) which is the sum of frequencies up to x.

Therefore, the Fenwick Tree implementation needs to have the following methods:

- update(v): add 1 to the frequency of v.

- query(x): returns the sum of frequencies for all values <=x.

So the Fenwick Tree can be implemented as follows.

Now, considering the maximum possible value of x in query is up to n. So the Fenwick Tree needs to have a size of n+1 (assuming 1-based indexing). For example, if the maximum possible value is 1e6, then the Fenwick Tree's size is 1e6 +1.

But in Python, creating a list of size 1e6+2 is manageable, as each integer in Python is about 28 bytes (but even then, for 1e6 elements, it's 1e6 *4 bytes if using a list of integers, which is 4MB, acceptable).

So now, let's outline the code steps.

First, compute prefix_counts and suffix_counts.

For prefix_counts:

Initialize a dictionary (like a default dict) to count occurrences. Then, for each element in the array from left to right, increment the count in the dictionary and store the current count in prefix_counts.

For example:

a = [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1]

prefix_counts would be:

1:1 → 1
2:1 → 1
1:2 → 2
1:3 →3
2:2 →2
2:3 →3
1:4 →4

So prefix_counts array is [1,1,2,3,2,3,4].

Similarly, for suffix_counts:

Process from right to left. For each element, increment the count and store the current count.

For the same example:

Process 1 (index 6): count is 1 → suffix_counts[6] =1.

index 5: 2 → count 1 → suffix_counts[5] =1.

index 4:2 → count becomes 2 → suffix_counts[4] =2.

index 3:1 → count 2 (from index 6 and 3) → suffix_counts[3] =2.

index 2:1 → count becomes 3 (indices 6,3,2) → suffix_counts[2] =3.

index 1:2 → count 3 (indices 4,5,1) → suffix_counts[1]=3.

index 0:1 → count 4 (indices 6,3,2,0) → suffix_counts[0]=4.

So suffix_counts array is [4,3,3,2,2,1,1].

Then, for each j in 0..6:

For j=0, suffix_counts[j] is 4. The Fenwick Tree is empty → sum_greater is 0-0=0. Add prefix_counts[0] =1.

For j=1, suffix_counts[j] is3. Fenwick Tree has [1]. Current_total is 1. sum_greater is 1 - query(3). query(3) is sum of elements <=3 → since the Fenwick Tree has a 1, the sum is 1. So 1-1=0. So this contributes 0. Then add prefix_counts[1] =1.

For j=2, suffix_counts[j] is3. Fenwick Tree has [1,1]. Current_total=2. sum_greater=2 - query(3). query(3) is 2 (since both elements are 1 <=3). sum_greater is 0. Then add 2 (prefix_counts[2] is 2).

For j=3, suffix_counts[j] is2. Current_total is3 (elements are 1,1,2). sum_greater=3 - query(2). query(2) is 3 (since 1+1+2's count if 2 is <=2). So 3-3=0. Add 3.

For j=4, suffix_counts[j] is2. Current_total is4. The elements are 1,1,2,3. query(2) gives 1+1+2 (since 2 is <=2, 3 is not. Wait, Fenwick Tree stores the frequencies. So for elements 1,1,2,3, the frequencies are:

1:2

2:1

3:1

So query(2) would return 2 (frequency of 1) +1 (frequency of 2) =3. sum_greater is 4 -3 =1. So this j=4 contributes 1. Because there are 1 elements (3) in the Fenwick Tree >2. So adding 1 to the answer.

Then add prefix_counts[4] which is 2. Now the elements are 1,1,2,3,2.

For j=5, suffix_counts[j] is1. Current_total is5. elements are 1,1,2,3,2. sum_greater=5 - query(1). query(1) is 2 (since there are two 1's). So 5-2=3. So this contributes 3. Then add prefix_counts[5]=3. Now elements are 1,1,2,3,2,3.

For j=6, suffix_counts[j] is1. Current_total is6. sum_greater=6 - query(1). query(1) is 2 (the two 1's). 6-2=4. So contributes 4. Add prefix_counts[6]=4.

The total answer is 0+0+0+0+1+3+4=8, which matches the first example.

So the approach works.

Now, implementing this in Python.

But what about the Fenwick Tree?

The Fenwick Tree needs to support:

- update(v): add 1 to the frequency of v.

- query(x): sum of frequencies of all elements <=x.

The maximum possible x is the maximum prefix_counts, which can be up to 1e6.

But in Python, building a Fenwick Tree of size 1e6+2 is feasible.

So the code steps are:

Read n.

Read the array.

Compute prefix_counts:

Initialize a dictionary (using a default dict or a regular dict) to track counts. For each element in the array, increment the count and append to prefix_counts.

Compute suffix_counts:

Similarly, iterate from the end, track counts, append to a list (and reverse it at the end).

Then, create a Fenwick Tree with maximum value equal to the maximum possible prefix_count (which is n).

Then, for each j in 0..n-1:

   x = suffix_counts[j]

   ans += (current_total) - fenwick.query(x)

   fenwick.update(prefix_counts[j])

Where current_total is j (since before processing j, the Fenwick Tree has j elements, which are the first j elements of prefix_counts).

But wait, current_total is the number of elements in the Fenwick Tree, which is j (since for j=0, it's 0 elements before processing).

So the code can be:

ans = 0

fenwick = FenwickTree(max_val)

for j in range(n):

    x = suffix_counts[j]

    current_total = j  # since after j-1 insertions, before j-th insertion.

    # the number of elements >x is current_total - fenwick.query(x)

    ans += (current_total - fenwick.query(x))

    fenwick.update(prefix_counts[j])

But wait, the Fenwick Tree starts empty. For j=0, current_total is 0. Then, after adding prefix_counts[0], the Fenwick Tree has one element. For j=1, current_total is 1, and after adding prefix_counts[1], it has two elements, etc.

Yes, this is correct.

Now, implement the Fenwick Tree.

Here's the Fenwick Tree code:

class FenwickTree:

    def __init__(self, size):

        self.size = size

        self.tree = [0] * (size + 1)  # 1-based indexing

    def update(self, index, delta=1):

        # Increment the frequency at 'index' by delta.

        # index is 1-based.

        while index <= self.size:

            self.tree[index] += delta

            index += index & -index

    def query(self, index):

        # Sum from 1 to 'index' (inclusive).

        res = 0

        while index > 0:

            res += self.tree[index]

            index -= index & -index

        return res

Wait, but in the problem, the values can be up to 1e6, but the Fenwick Tree's size is set to max_val. So for example, if the prefix_counts can be up to 1e6, then the Fenwick Tree's size is 1e6.

But in the code, when you call update, the index is prefix_counts[j], which can be up to 1e6.

But when the Fenwick Tree is initialized with size 1e6, then the maximum index is 1e6, and the update and query operations are valid.

But what if some prefix_counts[j] is larger than the size? Then, in the Fenwick Tree, the update would index into a position beyond the size. But that's possible. So to handle all possible values, the size must be at least the maximum possible value in prefix_counts.

So to compute the maximum value in prefix_counts, we can find the maximum after building the prefix_counts array.

Alternatively, since prefix_counts[i] can't exceed i+1 (since it's the count of ai in the first i+1 elements). The maximum possible prefix_counts[i] is n (if all elements are the same). So the Fenwick Tree's size can be set to n.

So during initialization:

max_val = max(prefix_counts)

But for n=1e6, that's O(n) to compute, but manageable.

Alternatively, since each prefix_counts[i] is the count of a_i up to i (left to right), the maximum possible value is n. So the Fenwick Tree's size can be n.

So the code:

Read the array, compute prefix_counts and suffix_counts.

Compute max_prefix = max(prefix_counts)

max_suffix = max(suffix_counts)

The Fenwick Tree needs to handle up to max_prefix.

But in any case, the Fenwick Tree can be initialized with size n, since prefix_counts can't exceed n.

Thus, in the code, the Fenwick Tree is initialized with size n.

But when building the Fenwick Tree with size n, and if some prefix_counts[j] is larger than n, it will crash. But since prefix_counts[j] can't be larger than j+1 (since when processing left to right, each element's count is incremented each time it appears. So for example, the first occurrence is 1, then 2, etc. The maximum possible is when all elements are the same. Then prefix_counts[i] = i+1. So for i=1e6-1 (n=1e6), prefix_counts[i] =1e6. So the maximum possible is 1e6. So the Fenwick Tree's size should be 1e6.

But when n is up to 1e6, the Fenwick Tree's size is 1e6, which is manageable.

Thus, the code can proceed.

Now, testing the first example:

n=7, a = [1,2,1,1,2,2,1]

prefix_counts = [1,1,2,3,2,3,4]

max_prefix is 4. So the Fenwick Tree size is 4. But for j=4, prefix_counts[j] is 2. For j=5, prefix_counts[j] is 3. For j=6, 4. So the Fenwick Tree is initialized with size 4.

When processing j=6 (prefix_counts[j] =4), the update is called with 4. Since the Fenwick Tree size is 4, index 4 is allowed.

So the code works.

Another example: input 3 1 1 1. Then prefix_counts are [1,2,3]. suffix_counts are [3,2,1]. So Fenwick Tree size is 3. All updates are 1,2,3. So when j=2 (third element), suffix_counts[j] is 1. The Fenwick Tree before adding has j=2 elements (1 and 2). sum_greater is 2 - query(1). query(1) is 1 (only the first element). So 2-1=1. So the answer is 0 (for j=0) +0 (for j=1) +1 (for j=2) =1. Which matches the sample.

So the code works.

Now, let's proceed to code.

First, read n.

Then read the array.

Compute prefix_counts:

We can use a dictionary (like a defaultdict(int)) to track the counts. For each element in the array, increment the count and append to prefix_counts.

Similarly for suffix_counts: iterate from the end, track counts in another defaultdict, append the current count, then reverse the list.

But in Python, for the suffix_counts, appending and reversing is O(n). For n=1e6, that's acceptable.

Now, code:

Testing against sample input 1.

```python

class FenwickTree:

    def __init__(self, size):

        self.size = size

        self.tree = [0]*(self.size +2)  # 1-based, up to size

    def update(self, idx):

        # idx is 1-based

        while idx <= self.size:

            self.tree[idx] +=1

            idx += idx & -idx

    def query(self, idx):

        res =0

        while idx >0:

            res += self.tree[idx]

            idx -= idx & -idx

        return res

def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    input = input_stream.read().split()

    n = int(input[0])

    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))

    # Compute prefix_counts

    prefix_counts = []

    freq = defaultdict(int)

    for num in a:

        freq[num] +=1

        prefix_counts.append(freq[num])

    # Compute suffix_counts

    suffix_counts = []

    freq_suffix = defaultdict(int)

    for num in reversed(a):

        freq_suffix[num] +=1

        suffix_counts.append(freq_suffix[num])

    # reverse to get the correct order

    suffix_counts = suffix_counts[::-1]

    # Now, process each j, answer is sum over j of (j - query(suffix_counts[j]))

    max_prefix = max(prefix_counts) if n else 0

    # Fenwick Tree with size up to max_prefix

    ft = FenwickTree(max_prefix)

    ans =0

    for j in range(n):

        x = suffix_counts[j]

        # current_total is j, since before processing j, we have j elements (0..j-1)

        # sum_greater = j - query(x)

        # But need to handle the case where x is larger than max_prefix. In that case, query returns sum up to max_prefix.

        # So sum_greater is j - query(x)

        # but the Fenwick Tree's size is max_prefix. So for x >= max_prefix, query returns sum up to max_prefix. For x > max_prefix, sum_greater is j - sum_total (since all elements are <=max_prefix, so sum_greater is 0 if x >=max_prefix).

        # But how?

        # Suppose x is 5, and the Fenwick Tree has max_prefix 3. Then query(x) is sum up to 3.

        # sum_greater is j - query(x). So it's j - sum of all elements <=3 (which is sum_total). So sum_greater is j - sum_total → which is zero, since all elements are <=3.

        # So if x >=max_prefix, then sum_greater is j - sum_total. But sum_total is the number of elements inserted so far (j elements). So sum_greater is zero.

        # So in code, even if x is larger than the max_prefix, it's handled correctly.

        sum_x = ft.query(x)

        ans += j - sum_x

        # update the Fenwick Tree with prefix_counts[j]

        ft.update(prefix_counts[j])

    print(ans, file=output_stream)

Wait, in the sample explanation, for j=4 (which is the fifth element in the array, 0-based index 4), the current_total is4. The Fenwick Tree has elements [1,1,2,3]. sum_greater is4 - sum up to x=2. sum up to 2 is 1+1+2 (since 2 is <=2). sum is4. 4-4=0.

But according to the sample explanation, j=4's contribution is 1. Hmm. Wait, this suggests a problem in the code.

Wait, the sample for j=4 (index 4) has suffix_counts[j=4] as2. The Fenwick Tree elements are 1,1,2,3. So the elements greater than 2 are 3. So count is1. So sum_greater should be1.

But according to the code, it's current_total (4) - query(2) (sum up to 2 is 1+1+2=4). So 4-4=0. So code returns0, but correct answer is1.

Ah! Here's the problem. The Fenwick Tree's query is summing the frequencies of elements <=x. But when elements are stored as individual elements, the Fenwick Tree's frequencies are counts of how many times each value has been inserted. So in the case where elements are 1,1,2,3:

the Fenwick Tree's data is:

frequency of 1:2

frequency of 2:1

frequency of3:1

So the query for x=2 is sum of frequencies for 1 and 2, which is 2+1=3. So sum_greater is4-3=1.

But according to the code's Fenwick Tree implementation, how is this handled?

Looking at the code:

The Fenwick Tree's update function is called with the value of prefix_counts[j]. For example, when we add a 3, we call update(3), which increments the frequency at index3 by1.

Thus, in the example, after adding 1,1,2,3, the Fenwick Tree's frequencies are:

1:2, 2:1,3:1.

So when querying x=2, the code's query function sums all frequencies from 1 to 2. So 2 (from 1) +1 (from 2) =3. So sum_greater =4-3=1, which is correct.

So why in the code's example, when j=4 (0-based), sum_greater is1. So the code would add 1 to the answer.

But according to the code above, for j=4 (0-based), the current_total is4.

sum_x = ft.query(2) → which is3. ans +=4-3=1. Then add prefix_counts[4]=2. So the Fenwick Tree now has 1,1,2,3,2.

But according to the code, the Fenwick Tree is initialized with size max_prefix, which for the first example is4. So when we add prefix_counts[j=4]=2, which is within the size of4. So the code should correctly update the Fenwick Tree.

Ah, I see. So in the code, the Fenwick Tree's size is set to max_prefix, which is4. So the code is correct.

So why in the code's sample calculation for j=4, sum_greater is1.

But according to the code, the code correctly computes sum_greater as j (4) - query(2) (3) →1.

So the code is correct.

So why did the sample code's code work correctly for j=4?

In the sample code:

For j=4:

x=2.

sum_x = ft.query(2). The Fenwick Tree has elements 1,1,2,3. query(2) returns 3. sum_greater=4-3=1. So ans increases by1.

Yes.

So the code works correctly.

Thus, the code should be correct.

Another example: input 3 1 1 1.

prefix_counts are [1,2,3].

suffix_counts are [3,2,1].

max_prefix=3.

Fenwick Tree size is3.

For j=0:

x=3. current_total is0. sum_x=0. ans +=0-0=0. Add1.

j=1:

x=2. current_total=1. query(2) returns 0 (because Fenwick Tree has 1). sum_greater=1-0=1. But wait, the Fenwick Tree contains 1. query(2) is sum of frequencies <=2. So 1. current_total is1. 1-1=0. So ans is0.

Wait, no. Because for j=1, current_total is1 (j=1). sum_x is query(2). The Fenwick Tree has 1 (added when j=0). So sum_x=1 (since 1<=2). sum_greater=1-1=0. Then add 2 (prefix_counts[1]=2).

j=2, x=1. current_total=2. Fenwick Tree has 1 and 2. query(1) is1. sum_greater=2-1=1. ans is0+0+1=1.

Yes.

Thus, the code works.

Thus, the code should be correct.
