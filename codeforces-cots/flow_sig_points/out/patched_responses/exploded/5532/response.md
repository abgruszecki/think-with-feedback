Okay, let's see. The problem is about replacing consecutive UR or RU pairs with D to minimize the length of the sequence. So, the goal is to find the minimum possible length after all possible replacements are done. Hmm.

First, I need to understand how the replacements work. Each time there's a UR or RU, we can replace them with D. But each replacement reduces the length by 1, right? Because two moves become one. But after replacement, the new D might form a new pair with adjacent moves. For example, if after replacing UR with D, the next character is R or U, maybe that creates another RU or UR pair. Wait, but D is a new character. So D can't form a pair with U or R, right? Because the problem says only UR and RU can be replaced. So once a D is added, it's part of the sequence and doesn't combine with others. So the replacements are done greedily, but perhaps in a way that depends on the order of replacement.

Wait, but the problem states that replacements can be done any number of times until there's no possible pairs left. So the optimal way would be to find the maximum number of possible pairs that can be replaced. Because each replacement reduces the total length by 1 (since two characters become one), the minimal possible length is the original length minus the number of replacements made.

So the key is to find how many non-overlapping pairs of UR or RU we can find in the sequence. Wait, but overlapping pairs can be processed in a way that allows more replacements. For example, consider the sequence RUR. If we first replace the first two R and U as D, then the remaining R is left. So total replacements is 1. Alternatively, if the sequence is URRU, maybe overlapping pairs can be handled in a way that allows more replacements.

Wait, but the problem allows any order of replacement. So perhaps the best approach is to model this as a greedy problem. But how?

Alternatively, think of it as counting the number of transitions between R and U. Because every time there's a switch between R and U, that's a possible place for a D. For example, the number of times R and U alternate in consecutive steps.

Wait, maybe the minimal length is determined by the number of transitions between R and U. Let's see. For example, the first example input is RUURU. Let's break it down:

Original sequence: R U U R U.

Looking at consecutive pairs:

R and U → replace with D. But after replacement, the next character would be U (from the second U). Wait, maybe the way to model this is to count the number of times two different characters appear consecutively. Because each such occurrence can be replaced once.

Wait, let's take the first example: RUURU.

Breaking it down:

Positions: 0:R, 1:U, 2:U, 3:R, 4:U.

Pairs are RU (0-1), UU (1-2), UR (2-3), RU (3-4). So there are three RU/UR pairs here. Replacing each of those would reduce the length by 3. Original length is 5, 5-3=2? But the sample output is 3. Hmm. Wait, maybe the replacements can't all be done because they overlap.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model this as the number of transitions between R and U in the original sequence, and the minimal length is the original length minus the number of transitions. Or maybe not.

Alternatively, think of the problem as grouping consecutive R's and U's. For instance, consecutive R's or U's can't be replaced. So the minimal length is the sum of the counts of each group, but with each transition between R and U allowing for a possible D.

Wait, here's an idea. Let's process the sequence into runs of R and U. For example, for the first example:

R, UU, R, U → four groups. Each transition between groups is a possible point where a pair could be formed. But how does that help?

Wait, perhaps the maximum number of possible D's is equal to the number of transitions between R and U. Because each transition corresponds to a possible pair. For example, in the first example, the transitions are between R and U (after first character), then U to R (after third), then R to U (after fourth). So three transitions, which matches the three possible replacements (the three pairs RU, UR, RU). So each transition allows one replacement, which would sum up to the number of transitions. But then the total number of D's would be equal to the number of transitions, and the remaining characters would be the number of groups (since each group is a run of same characters). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Suppose the original sequence is split into k groups of consecutive R or U. Then the number of transitions between R and U is k-1. For each transition, we can have a possible pair (like the last character of the previous group and the first of the next group). But each replacement consumes two characters (the last of the previous group and the first of the next), which would merge the two groups into one (since replacing RU or UR with D would leave D, and the next group would now be adjacent to the previous group's new D). Hmm, maybe this approach is not straightforward.

Alternatively, think of each time two consecutive different characters are present. Each such occurrence can be replaced by a D. But once replaced, the D is a new character, which doesn't form any pairs. So the replacement process can't affect the adjacent characters once a D is placed. Wait, but that's not the case. Because after replacement, the D is in the sequence. So, the replacement of two consecutive R and U with D would split the sequence into parts. For example, suppose we have RUR. Replacing the first two as D gives DR. Then, D and R can't be replaced. So total replacements here is 1.

But in the case of RURU, if we replace the first two as D, then we have D RU. Then, the RU can be replaced as D, leading to two replacements, total length 2 (original 4, 4-2=2). So how many pairs are there here? The original sequence has RU followed by RU. Each pair can be replaced once, leading to two replacements.

So in this case, the number of possible replacements is equal to the number of such consecutive pairs, but they can't overlap. Wait, but in this case, they are overlapping. So in RURU, the pairs are positions 0-1 (RU), 1-2 (UR), 2-3 (RU). So three possible pairs. But when replacing, each replacement uses two characters, so overlapping pairs can't all be replaced. For example, replacing 0-1 as D, the sequence becomes D RU. Then replace 1-2 (now D is at 0, R at 1, U at 2). Wait, no, after replacement, the D is the first character, then the next two are R and U. So after replacing the first RU, the sequence is D followed by RU. Then, replacing RU again gives DD, which is two replacements. So total of two. But the original three pairs can't all be replaced. So the maximum possible is two.

So the key is that overlapping pairs can't be all replaced. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs of RU or UR. But how?

Alternatively, the maximum number of replacements possible is equal to the number of transitions between R and U in the original sequence. For example, each transition between R and U (like R followed by U, or U followed by R) allows for one replacement.

Wait, in the first example, the transitions are R→U (after first character), U→R (after third), R→U (after fourth). So three transitions. The maximum number of replacements is three. Original length is 5, 5 - 3 = 2. But the sample output is 3. Wait, that doesn't match. So maybe this approach is incorrect.

Wait the sample input 5 is RUURU. The initial sequence is R U U R U. The transitions are R→U, then U→R (after the third character), R→U (after the fourth). So three transitions. But the sample output is 3. Original length is 5. 5-3=2, but the output is 3. So this approach is not working.

Hmm. So what's wrong here?

Wait in the first example, after all possible replacements, the minimal length is 3. So 5-2=3. So the number of replacements is 2. How?

Let's see. The initial sequence is R U U R U.

Possible replacements:

- The first pair R U can be replaced by D. Then the sequence becomes D U R U. Then, the pair U R can be replaced by D. Now it's D D U. Length 3. So two replacements. So total of 2, 5-2=3. So how to find that the maximum number of replacements is 2.

Hmm. So how to model the maximum number of possible replacements.

Another approach: Let's model the problem by finding the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs of RU or UR. Each pair can be replaced once, but after replacement, the new D cannot form any pairs. So the algorithm is to scan the sequence and whenever a pair RU or UR is found, replace it with D, and then skip the next character (since it's part of the pair). But since the replacement can be done in any order, the optimal way is to greedily replace as many pairs as possible.

Wait, but the order might affect the total. For example, consider the sequence RURU. If we replace the first RU as D, then the next RU can be replaced as D. So two replacements. But if the sequence is URRU, then replacing the first UR gives DRU, then the RU can be replaced, leading to two replacements as well. So perhaps the optimal way is to process the sequence from left to right, replacing whenever possible.

So the maximum number of replacements can be found by scanning the string and whenever a RU or UR is found, count it as a replacement and skip the next character.

Let's see. For the first example: RUURU.

Indices 0-1: RU → replace, count 1. Skip index 1. Then next is index 2 (U), but index 2 and 3 are UR → replace, count 2. Skip index 3. Next is index 4 (U), no pair. Total 2. So 5-2=3. Which matches the sample.

Another example: the second input is UUURRRRRUUURURUUU. Let's see. The original length is 17. The sample output is 13. So 17-4=13. So four replacements.

Let's think about how to count the replacements. Let's process the string:

Original: UUU RRRRR UUU R U R UUU.

Processing from left:

UUU RRRRR → transitions from U to R. The first R is at index 3, so the pair U (3-1) and R (3) would be UR. But since the R's are consecutive, perhaps the first possible pair is at the transition points. Wait, maybe the approach is to count the number of times consecutive R and U appear. So the maximum number of replacements is the number of transitions between R and U. But in the first example, the transitions are 3, but the number of replacements is 2. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of transitions is k. Then the maximum number of replacements is floor(k/2). Or (k+1)/2? Hmm.

Alternatively, the maximum number of replacements is equal to the number of times a pair of RU or UR appears, but considering that each replacement removes two characters and replaces them with one, which can't form new pairs. So the problem becomes similar to finding the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs in the sequence, where a pair is any two consecutive RU or UR.

But how to model this.

Let's model the sequence as a list of characters. We can iterate through the sequence and whenever we find a pair (current and next character is RU or UR), replace them with D, increment the count, and then skip the next character (since it's part of the pair). This is a greedy approach. Let's test this on the first example.

Original: R U U R U.

Iterate from left:

i=0: current is R, next is U → replace. count=1. i increments by 2 (now i=2). Now the next pair is U and R (i=2 and 3). Replace. count=2. i increments by 2 (i=4). Now i=4 is the last character. So total replacements 2. So 5-2=3. Correct.

Second example input: UUURRRRRUUURURUUU.

Original sequence:

UUU RRRRR UUU R U R UUU → groups are U (3), R (5), U (3), R (1), U (1), R (1), U (3). So transitions between groups are 6 transitions.

Processing with the greedy approach:

Start at i=0:

Check i=0 and 1: U and U → no. So move to i=1: same. i=2: U and R (i=2 and 3)? No. Wait, the first group is UUU, then R's. So the first R is at index 3. So pair at i=2 (U) and i=3 (R): UR. So in the original string, positions 2-3 are UR. So during processing, we can replace them.

But perhaps the greedy approach is:

i=0: check s[0] and s[1]. If they are a pair, replace, count +=1, i +=2. Else, i +=1.

So in the first example, the first pair is R and U (i=0 and 1). So count 1, i becomes 2. Then i=2: U and R (positions 2 and 3). Count becomes 2, i becomes 4. Then i=4: U (position 4) and next is nothing? So done. So total 2.

So for the second example, let's see:

Original sequence: U U U R R R R R U U U R U R U U U.

Let's process step by step.

i=0: s[0]=U, s[1]=U. Not a pair. i=1.

s[1]=U, s[2]=U → same. i=2.

s[2]=U, s[3]=R → pair UR. Replace. count +=1. i becomes 4.

Now i=4: s[4]=R, s[5]=R → same. i=5.

s[5]=R, s[6]=R → same. i=6.

s[6]=R, s[7]=U → pair RU. Replace. count +=1. i becomes 8.

s[8]=U, s[9]=U → same. i=9.

s[9]=U, s[10]=R → pair UR. Replace. count +=1. i becomes 11.

s[11]=U, s[12]=R → pair UR. Replace. count +=1. i becomes 13.

s[13]=R, s[14]=U → pair RU. Replace. count +=1. i becomes 15.

s[15]=U, s[16]=U → same. i=16. End of string.

Total count is 5? Then original length is 17, 17-5=12. But the sample output is 13. So this approach overcounts. Wait, sample input 2's output is 13, which implies 17-4=13. So the number of replacements is 4, but according to this approach, we have 5. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe the problem with the approach is that after replacing a pair, the D is inserted, but in the original problem, the replacement allows further replacements. Wait, no. Because once you replace a pair, the D is part of the sequence, but the next steps would process the new sequence. However, the approach of processing the original sequence greedily in passes may not capture all possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more complex. Because replacing a pair may allow another pair to form. For example, suppose we have R U R. If we replace the first R U as D, then the D R would not form a pair. But if we replace the U R pair, then R D is not a pair. So the order of replacement affects the total count.

But in the problem statement, Mikhail can perform replacements in any order until no more can be done. So the optimal approach would be to find the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs possible, considering that each replacement can be done in any order, including possibly allowing overlaps in the original string to be replaced.

Wait, but after replacing a pair, the new D is in the sequence and can't form new pairs. So the order of replacements can affect how many total replacements are possible. For example, consider the sequence RURUR.

Original sequence: R U R U R.

If you replace the first RU (positions 0-1) as D, the sequence becomes D R U R. Then, replace RU (positions 2-3) → D R D. Total replacements 2. Final length 3.

Alternatively, replace positions 1-2 (UR) → R D U R. Then replace positions 2-3 (DU → no. So no further replacements. Total 1. So the first approach is better.

So to maximize the number of replacements, we need to choose pairs in a way that allows as many non-overlapping pairs as possible. The optimal way is to greedily replace pairs when possible, perhaps by scanning left to right.

Thus, the approach of scanning the original sequence and whenever a pair is found, replace it (count it) and skip the next character, would give the maximum number of possible pairs. Because this allows the maximum possible non-overlapping pairs.

But in the sample input 2, the approach of this greedy method gives a higher count than the sample's expected result. So there's a problem.

Wait sample input 2:

Original sequence is UUURRRRRUUURURUUU (length 17).

Sample output is 13 → 17-13=4. So only 4 replacements are possible.

But according to the previous approach, the count was 5. So that's a discrepancy.

What's going on here?

Let me re-examine the sample input 2.

The input is:

UUURRRRRUUURURUUU.

Let me write out the entire string as individual characters:

Indices 0: U, 1:U, 2:U, 3:R,4:R,5:R,6:R,7:R,8:U,9:U,10:U,11:R,12:U,13:R,14:U,15:U,16:U.

So the string is:

U U U R R R R R U U U R U R U U U.

Let's process this with the greedy approach:

Initialize count=0, i=0.

i=0: s[0] is U, s[1] is U → same. Move to i=1.

i=1: U and U → same. Move to i=2.

i=2: U and R (s[3] is R). So UR pair. count +=1. i becomes 4.

i=4: s[4] is R, s[5] R → same. Move to i=5.

i=5: R and R → same. i=6.

i=6: R and R → same. i=7.

i=7: R and U (s[8] is U). Pair RU. count +=1. i=9.

s[9] is U, s[10] U → same. i=10.

i=10: U and R (s[11] R). Pair UR. count +=1. i=12.

s[12] is U, s[13] R → UR. count +=1. i=14.

s[14] is R, s[15] U → RU. count +=1. i=16.

s[16] is U, and that's the end. So count is 5. So 17-5=12. But sample output is 13. So why the discrepancy?

The sample output is 13. So according to that, the correct number of replacements is 4. But according to this greedy approach, it's 5. Which is impossible. So the approach is wrong.

Hmm. So where is the mistake?

Wait maybe the order of replacements in the original problem allows for certain pairs to be processed which the greedy approach is not considering. For example, perhaps some pairs can't be processed in the same way as the greedy approach, leading to fewer replacements.

Wait let's think of the sample input 2's original sequence. Let's see what replacements are possible.

Original string:

UUURRRRRUUURURUUU → let's group into runs:

UUU (3), RRRRR (5), UUU (3), R (1), U (1), R (1), UUU (3).

Transitions between R and U: 6 transitions.

So the transitions are U→R (after first group), R→U (after second group), U→R (after third group), R→U (after fourth group), U→R (after fifth group), R→U (after sixth group).

So 6 transitions. But the sample output is 13. 17-13=4. So 4 replacements. So the number of transitions is 6, but the number of possible replacements is 4. So how?

Hmm. Let's try to find the actual replacements.

The sample's expected output is 13. So the original length is 17, and the minimal possible is 13. So 4 replacements.

So where are these 4 replacements in the original string?

Let's look for possible pairs:

Possible pairs in the original sequence:

At index 2 and 3: U and R (UR).

At index 7 and 8: R and U (RU).

At index 10 and 11: U and R (UR).

At index 12 and 13: U and R (UR).

At index 13 and 14: R and U (RU).

At index 14 and 15: U and R (UR).

Wait, but perhaps some of these pairs can't all be replaced because they are overlapping.

For example:

If we replace the pair at positions 2-3 (UR), then positions 7-8 (RU), then 10-11 (UR), then 12-13 (UR). But these are non-overlapping.

Wait, let's see:

After replacing positions 2-3: UR becomes D. So the new sequence is UU D RRRUUURURUUU. Then, the next pair is R and U (positions 5 and 6 in the original sequence, but after replacement, the sequence is different). Hmm, perhaps this approach is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to replace as follows:

1. Replace the UR at positions 2-3 → becomes D. The new sequence is UU D RRRRUUURURUUU. Now length is 16.

2. Replace the RU at positions 6-7 (original R at 7 and U at 8, but after first replacement, the positions shift. So after the first replacement, the R's are RRRR (since original 3 R's after the D? Wait, perhaps this is getting too messy.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum number of replacements is the number of transitions divided by 2, rounded down.

In the first example, transitions are 3, so 3//2=1. But sample output required 2 replacements. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, the number of transitions is the number of times the direction changes. For each pair of consecutive transitions, perhaps we can count one replacement.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal number of replacements is the number of transitions between R and U minus 1 divided by 2. For example, transitions+1 // 2.

But in the first example, transitions is 3 → (3+1)/2=2, which matches the sample. For the second example, transitions is 6 → (6)/2=3. But sample's required replacements are 4. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Alternative approach: For each pair of consecutive RU or UR in the original string, check how many can be replaced, but considering that each replacement consumes two characters. So overlapping pairs can't be replaced.

The maximum number of non-overlapping pairs is the answer. But how to model this.

The problem reduces to finding the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs of RU or UR in the original sequence.

For example:

In the first example, the pairs are RU (0-1), UU (1-2) no, UR (2-3), RU (3-4). So possible pairs are at 0-1, 2-3, 3-4. But overlapping. So the maximum non-overlapping pairs would be 0-1 and 3-4 (two), or 2-3 and 3-4 (also overlapping). So the maximum is two.

Which matches the sample.

In the second example, the pairs are at positions 2-3 (UR), 7-8 (RU), 10-11 (UR), 12-13 (UR), 13-14 (RU), 14-15 (UR).

These pairs are:

0. 2-3 (UR)

1. 7-8 (RU)

2. 10-11 (UR)

3. 12-13 (UR)

4. 13-14 (RU)

5. 14-15 (UR)

We need to select the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs.

So, for example:

Select 2-3 (UR) → occupies positions 2 and 3.

Then next pair can start at position 4. The next possible pair is 7-8 (RU). Then 10-11 (UR). Then 12-13 (UR). Then 14-15 (UR). So that's 4 pairs.

But wait, 12-13 is followed by 13-14, which overlaps. So if we select 12-13, we can't select 13-14. So perhaps after 12-13, the next possible is 14-15. So total of 5 pairs.

But sample output indicates that only 4 replacements are possible.

Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternative idea: the maximum number of pairs is the number of transitions between R and U divided by 2. Because each transition is a point between two different characters. Each pair consumes two transitions.

Wait, in the first example, transitions are R→U, U→R, R→U (3 transitions). The number of pairs is 3/2 rounded down. Which is 1. But the sample requires 2 pairs. So that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of pairs is the number of transitions plus 1 divided by 2. For example, transitions +1 // 2.

In the first example: (3+1)//2=2. Which matches. For the second example, transitions is 6. (6+1)//2=3.5 → 3. But sample requires 4. So no.

Hmm.

Alternative approach: let's model the problem as follows. Each replacement of a pair of UR or RU with D reduces the sequence length by 1. The goal is to find the maximum possible number of such replacements. Once all possible replacements are done, the minimal possible length is the original n minus the number of replacements.

So how to compute the maximum number of replacements.

We can model the problem as a greedy choice. We iterate through the string, and whenever a pair is found (current and next character are RU or UR), we replace them (count +=1) and skip the next character. This way, we process the string in passes, ensuring that each replacement is non-overlapping.

But in the sample input 2, according to this approach, we counted 5 replacements, but the sample expects 4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis of the sample input 2.

Let me re-calculate the sample input 2 using the greedy approach.

Sample input 2's original sequence:

Indices 0-16: U U U R R R R R U U U R U R U U U.

Processing with the greedy approach:

Start at i=0.

i=0: s[0] = U, s[1] = U. Not a pair. i becomes 1.

i=1: s[1] = U, s[2] = U. Not a pair. i=2.

i=2: s[2] = U, s[3] = R. Pair UR. count +=1 (now 1). i becomes 4.

i=4: s[4] = R, s[5] = R. No pair. i=5.

i=5: s[5] = R, s[6] = R. No. i=6.

i=6: R, s[7] = R. No. i=7.

s[7] = R, s[8] = U. Pair RU. count +=1 (now 2). i becomes 9.

i=9: s[9] = U, s[10] = U. No. i=10.

s[10] = U, s[11] = R. Pair UR. count +=1 (now 3). i becomes 12.

s[12] = U, s[13] = R. Pair UR. count +=1 (now 4). i becomes 14.

s[14] = R, s[15] = U. Pair RU. count +=1 (now 5). i becomes 16. End.

So count is 5. So the length would be 17-5=12. But the sample output is 13. So something's wrong here.

But according to the sample, the correct number of replacements is 4. So the greedy approach is overcounting.

What's the mistake?

Ah! Because when we replace a pair, the replacement introduces a D, which could break the sequence and prevent further pairs that were previously possible. But the greedy approach is done on the original string, not the modified one.

Ah, right! The approach of iterating through the original string and counting pairs greedily is incorrect because it ignores the fact that replacing a pair may merge adjacent characters, which could allow for additional replacements. Wait no, no. Because when you replace a pair, the D is inserted, which would prevent further pairs from forming with the previous or next characters. However, the greedy approach we are using is not modeling this. Because it's processing the original string, not the modified one.

For example, in the original problem, after replacing a pair, the new sequence may have D followed by other characters. But the D cannot form pairs with those characters. So the order of replacements is important.

But our approach of processing the original string is not capturing the dynamic changes to the string after each replacement. Thus, the count can be higher than the actual possible replacements.

So the initial approach is incorrect. We need to model the actual replacements and how they affect the sequence.

So how to correctly model this?

The key insight is that each replacement affects the sequence, possibly merging new characters that could form new pairs. Or wait, no. Because when two characters are replaced by D, the D is part of the sequence. So for example, suppose the original sequence is RURU. If you replace the first RU as D, the sequence becomes D U. Then, there's no pair. So only one replacement. But if you replace the second RU first (positions 2-3), then the sequence is R D. Again, one replacement. But if you replace the first RU (positions 0-1) and then the next RU (positions 2-3) in the original string, the count would be 2. But this is impossible because after replacing the first pair, the remaining is U and R, which are now next to each other. So in the original problem, the order of replacements matters, and the maximum number of replacements depends on the order.

But this complicates things. So the problem requires us to find the maximum possible number of replacements, regardless of the order. How can this be modeled?

This sounds like a dynamic programming problem. For each position in the string, we can track whether the previous character was part of a replacement.

Alternatively, let's model the process as follows:

We can iterate through the string and whenever a pair is found, we replace it, but the replacement affects the subsequent pairs.

Thus, the correct way is to process the string while considering the current state after each replacement.

For example:

We can model the current state of the processed string as a list. We iterate through the list, checking for pairs. When a pair is found, we replace it with D and continue processing from the next position. But this would take O(n) time, which is acceptable given the small input size (n up to 100).

But this approach is not efficient for very large n, but since n is up to 100, it's manageable.

So the steps would be:

1. Initialize a list with the characters of the original string.

2. Iterate through the list from left to right. For each position i, check if i and i+1 form a pair (RU or UR). If so, replace them with D, increment the count, and skip the next character (since it's part of the pair). Then, continue processing from i+2.

3. Repeat this process until no more pairs are found.

But this approach is a greedy left-to-right scan, which may not capture all possible replacements. For example, in the case where there are overlapping pairs, scanning left to right may find some pairs, but other orders may find more.

However, given the time constraints, perhaps the left-to-right greedy approach is sufficient to find the maximum number of pairs.

But in the sample input 2, when applying this approach to the original string, the count is 5, but the sample requires 4. So what's the issue?

Wait, perhaps the sample input 2's correct replacement count is 4. But according to the approach above, it's 5. So why?

Let's re-examine the sample input 2's original string:

UUURRRRRUUURURUUU.

After applying the greedy approach:

Replaced pairs at positions 2-3 (UR → D), 7-8 (RU → D), 10-11 (UR → D), 12-13 (UR → D), 14-15 (RU → D). Total of 5 replacements.

But according to the sample's output, the minimal length is 13, which implies 17-13=4 replacements. So this suggests that the greedy approach is incorrect.

But the sample's explanation says that the shortened sequence is UUDRRRDUDDUUU (length 13). Let's see how many replacements that implies.

Original: UUURRRRRUUURURUUU.

The sample's output is UUDRRRDUDDUUU. Let's count the replacements:

- The first D is replacing UR at positions 2-3. So one.

- Then RRRR → no replacements. Then D is replacing RU at positions 7-8. Two.

- Then UU becomes UU. Next D replaces UR at positions 10-11. Three.

- Then U R becomes UR → replaced by D. Four.

So four replacements. Hence, the sample's output is 13, which requires four replacements.

So why does the greedy approach count five?

Because the approach is applied to the original string and not the modified string. So in reality, after some replacements are made, the modified string may have new pairs formed that were not present in the original string. But the approach of processing the original string in a single pass may not account for that.

Ah! So the initial approach is wrong because it doesn't account for the fact that replacements can create new pairs. Wait, but no. Because when you replace a pair, the new D is inserted. So in the modified string, the D is followed by the next character. But D can't form a pair with R or U. So new pairs are not created. Thus, the order of replacements in the original string doesn't matter. The maximum number of replacements is determined by the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs in the original string.

But why is there a discrepancy in the sample input 2?

Wait, perhaps the sample input 2's correct answer is 13, which implies 4 replacements. Let's see:

Original length 17-4=13.

So the maximum number of replacements is 4. So the greedy approach's count of 5 is wrong.

So the greedy approach's method of processing the original string is incorrect. Therefore, the way to model the problem must be different.

Hmm. So what's the correct way to model this?

Let me think again. When we replace a pair of characters, they are replaced by D, which does not form any pairs. So the process is that any replacements after that must be made on the remaining characters (those not part of any previous pair). So the order of replacement does not affect the maximum possible number of pairs. Because once a pair is replaced, the new D cannot form any new pairs. Thus, the maximum number of pairs is the number of non-overlapping pairs in the original string, where overlapping pairs are processed optimally.

But then, why does the sample input 2's greedy approach count 5, but the sample requires 4?

Ah, perhaps the initial analysis of the greedy approach's count for the sample input 2 is incorrect.

Wait, the sample input 2's original string is:

UUURRRRRUUURURUUU.

Let's re-examine the indices:

0: U

1: U

2: U

3: R

4: R

5: R

6: R

7: R

8: U

9: U

10: U

11: R

12: U

13: R

14: U

15: U

16: U.

Applying the greedy approach:

Start at i=0.

i=0: s[0]=U, s[1]=U → same. i=1.

i=1: U and U → same. i=2.

i=2: U and R (s[3]) → pair UR. count=1. i becomes 4.

i=4: s[4]=R, s[5]=R → same. i=5.

i=5: R and R → same. i=6.

i=6: R and R → same. i=7.

i=7: R and U (s[8]) → pair RU. count=2. i becomes 9.

i=9: s[9]=U, s[10]=U → same. i=10.

i=10: U and R (s[11]) → pair UR. count=3. i becomes 12.

i=12: U and R (s[13]) → pair UR. count=4. i becomes 14.

i=14: R and U (s[15]) → pair RU. count=5. i becomes 16.

i=16: no next character. So total count is 5.

But according to the sample, the correct count is 4. So why?

Ah! Because when you replace some pairs, you may be replacing pairs that are not part of the optimal selection.

For example, in the greedy approach, after replacing the pair at 2-3 (UR), then at 7-8 (RU), then 10-11 (UR), then 12-13 (UR), then 14-15 (RU).

But the sample's explanation's solution has only four D's. Let's see:

Sample output is UUDRRRDUDDUUU.

This implies:

- The first D is at position 2 (original pair UR).

- The second D is after RRRR (original RU at 7-8).

- Then another D at position 10-11 (UR).

- Then another D (from UR at 12-13? Or from UR and then another replacement).

Wait, the sample's output has four D's.

So how is this achieved?

Perhaps the optimal way is to replace the pairs at 2-3 (UR), 7-8 (RU), 10-11 (UR), 12-13 (UR). Then, the next pair is 13-14 (RU), but that would overlap with 12-13. So this would be four replacements.

So after replacing those four pairs, the sequence becomes UU D RRRR D U D D UUU. Which has length 13.

But how is this possible?

Original string after replacements:

- Replace 2-3 (UR) → D. Now the sequence is UU D R R R R U U U R U R U U U.

- Replace 7-8 (RR R U → after first replacement, the sequence's 7th character is U. Wait, perhaps this approach is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to replace non-overlapping pairs in the original string, but in a way that allows more pairs to be replaced later. But how?

The problem is that the greedy approach assumes that the pairs are processed in the original string, but the actual replacement process may merge some pairs and not allow others.

But since each replacement introduces a D which cannot form new pairs, the order in which pairs are processed in the original string affects which other pairs can be processed.

Thus, the greedy approach of processing pairs left to right may not give the maximum possible count.

This suggests that the optimal solution requires a dynamic programming approach, where we track the maximum number of replacements possible up to each position in the string.

Let's model this with DP.

Define dp[i] as the maximum number of replacements possible in the substring s[0..i].

We can process each character and decide whether to replace the current pair or not.

For each position i:

- If s[i] and s[i+1] form a pair (UR or RU), then we can choose to replace them. In this case, the number of replacements is 1 + dp[i-2], assuming that i-2 is >=0. Or, the previous state is up to i-2.

Alternatively, if we don't replace this pair, the number of replacements is dp[i-1].

Thus, the recurrence is:

dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], (if pair exists) 1 + dp[i-2]).

This is similar to the classic problem of counting maximum non-overlapping pairs.

Yes! This dynamic programming approach would correctly model the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs.

So for the string, we can model it as follows:

Initialize a DP array of size n, where dp[i] represents the maximum number of replacements up to index i.

For each i from 0 to n-1:

- If i is 0: dp[0] = 0 (no pairs possible).

- If i >= 1:

   if s[i-1] and s[i] form a pair (UR or RU):

      then dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], (i >=2 ? dp[i-2] : 0) + 1).

   else:

      dp[i] = dp[i-1]

Thus, the maximum number of replacements is dp[n-1].

Let's test this approach with the first sample input.

Sample 1: RUURU → indices 0-4.

n=5.

Initialize dp array of size 5.

i=0: dp[0]=0.

i=1: check s[0] and s[1] (R and U → pair). So dp[1] = max(dp[0], 0 +1) → 1.

i=2: check s[1] and s[2] (U and U → no). So dp[2] = dp[1] → 1.

i=3: check s[2] and s[3] (U and R → pair). So dp[3] = max(dp[2], dp[1] + 1) → max(1, 1+1=2) → 2.

i=4: check s[3] and s[4] (R and U → pair). dp[4] = max(dp[3], dp[2]+1) → max(2, 1+1=2) → 2.

So total replacements is 2. Which matches the sample.

For sample input 2:

The string is UUURRRRRUUURURUUU.

Let's process this with the DP approach.

The DP array for each i would be calculated as follows:

We can process each i from 0 to 16.

But this will take some time. Let's proceed step by step.

The string is:

0:U, 1:U, 2:U, 3:R,4:R,5:R,6:R,7:R,8:U,9:U,10:U,11:R,12:U,13:R,14:U,15:U,16:U.

n=17.

Initialize dp array of size 17.

i=0: dp[0] = 0.

i=1: s[0] and s[1] are U and U → no. dp[1] = dp[0] = 0.

i=2: s[1] and s[2] are U and U → no. dp[2] = dp[1] =0.

i=3: s[2] and s[3] are U and R → pair. So dp[3] = max(dp[2] (0), (i-2 >=0 ? dp[1] :0) +1 → 0+1=1). So dp[3]=1.

i=4: s[3] and s[4] are R and R → no. dp[4] = dp[3]=1.

i=5: R and R → no. dp[5] =1.

i=6: R and R → no. dp[6] =1.

i=7: R and R → no. dp[7]=1.

i=8: s[7] and s[8] are R and U → pair. So dp[8] = max(dp[7]=1, (i-2=6: dp[6]=1) +1 → 2. So dp[8]=2.

i=9: s[8] and s[9] are U and U → no. dp[9]=2.

i=10: s[9] and s[10] are U and U → no. dp[10]=2.

i=11: s[10] and s[11] are U and R → pair. So dp[11] = max(dp[10]=2, dp[9]=2 +1=3). So dp[11] =3.

i=12: s[11] and s[12] are R and U → pair. So dp[12] = max(dp[11]=3, dp[10]=2 +1=3). So dp[12]=3.

i=13: s[12] and s[13] are U and R → pair. So dp[13] = max(dp[12]=3, dp[11]=3 +1=4). So dp[13]=4.

i=14: s[13] and s[14] are R and U → pair. So dp[14] = max(dp[13]=4, dp[12]=3 +1=4). So dp[14]=4.

i=15: s[14] and s[15] are U and U → no. dp[15]=4.

i=16: s[15] and s[16] are U and U → no. dp[16]=4.

So the maximum number of replacements is 4. So 17-4=13, which matches the sample.

Thus, the dynamic programming approach correctly computes the maximum number of replacements.

Therefore, the correct approach is to use dynamic programming to model the maximum number of non-overlapping pairs possible.

So the plan is:

1. Iterate over the string from left to right.

2. For each position i, check if s[i] and s[i+1] form a pair.

3. Use the DP recurrence to compute the maximum possible replacements.

Once we have the maximum number of replacements, subtract that from the original length to get the minimal possible length.

Now, the code implementation.

The code will read the input n and the string. Then, compute the DP array.

But the string length can be up to 100. So the DP array will have size n.

For each i from 0 to n-1:

Initialize a DP array of size n, initialized to 0.

Then, for i from 1 to n-1:

Check if the current pair (i-1 and i) is a RU or UR.

If yes:

   dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], (dp[i-2] if i-2 >=0 else 0) + 1).

Else:

   dp[i] = dp[i-1].

The maximum number of replacements is dp[n-1].

Wait, because i represents the current position. For example, i=1 corresponds to the pair at 0-1. So when i is 1, we check the first two characters.

But the code's indices need to be handled carefully.

Wait, the string is s of length n. For each i in 0..n-1:

The pairs are at positions i and i+1. But when iterating up to i = n-2.

But in the DP approach, the indices are handled as follows:

For each i in 0 to n-1:

For each i, we check if the current character and the next character form a pair. But in the DP approach, we need to model the maximum number of pairs up to the current index.

Alternatively, in the DP approach, for each i (current index), we check the pair ending at i. So for i >=1:

if s[i-1] and s[i] form a pair, then we can take 1 + dp[i-2], or dp[i-1].

Thus, the code should be:

s = input().strip()

n = len(s)

if n < 2:

    print(n)

else:

    dp = [0]*n

    for i in range(1, n):

        pair = (s[i-1] != s[i])

        if pair:

            current = 1

            if i-2 >=0:

                current += dp[i-2]

            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], current)

        else:

            dp[i] = dp[i-1]

    max_replace = dp[-1]

    print(n - max_replace)

Wait, let's test this code.

Sample 1: input is 5, "RUURU".

n=5.

s = ['R', 'U', 'U', 'R', 'U'].

DP array initialized to [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

i=1:

check s[0] and s[1] → R and U → pair. So pair is True.

current = 1 + dp[i-2] (i-2 is -1 → 0). So current is 1.

dp[1] = max(dp[0]=0, 1) → 1.

dp array now [0, 1, 0, 0, 0].

i=2:

check s[1] and s[2] → U and U → no pair. dp[2] = dp[1] =1.

i=3:

s[2] and s[3] → U and R → pair.

current = 1 + dp[1] → 1+1=2.

dp[3] = max(dp[2]=1, 2) → 2.

i=4:

s[3] and s[4] → R and U → pair.

current = 1 + dp[2] → 1+1=2.

dp[4] = max(dp[3]=2, 2) → 2.

max_replace is 2. 5-2=3. Correct.

Sample 2:

n=17, string "UUURRRRRUUURURUUU".

The code's DP array for i=3 (s[2] and s[3] → UR → pair) → current = 1 + dp[1] → 0+1=1. dp[3] = max(0,1) →1.

At i=8: s[7] and s[8] → R and U → pair. i=8-2=6. dp[6] is 1. current is 2. dp[8] is max(1, 2) →2.

At i=11: s[10] and s[11] → U and R → pair. i-2=9. dp[9] is 2. current is 3. dp[11] becomes 3.

At i=13: s[12] and s[13] → U and R → pair. current is 1 + dp[11] (3) →4. dp[13] is max(3,4) →4.

Thus, the code will return 17-4=13. Which matches the sample.

Thus, the code is correct.

The code reads the input, constructs the DP array, and computes the maximum replacements. The minimal length is the original length minus the maximum replacements.

Now, the code needs to be written in Python, handling the case where n is 1.

So the code is:

Read n, then the string. But according to the input format, the second line is the sequence. So:

n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

But the problem says that the input is a sequence of n characters. So len(s) should be n. So the code proceeds as:

n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

if len(s) < 2:
    print(len(s))
else:
    dp = [0]*len(s)
    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        if s[i-1] != s[i]:
            current = 1
            if i >= 2:
                current += dp[i-2]
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], current)
        else:
            dp[i] = dp[i-1]
    max_replaces = dp[-1]
    print(len(s) - max_replaces)

Yes.

Now, testing the sample input 2:

The code correctly computes 4 replacements, leading to 17-4=13.

Thus, this code should work.
</think>

```python
n = int(input())
s = input().strip()

if n < 2:
    print(n)
else:
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i-1] != s[i]:
            current = 1 + (dp[i-2] if i >= 2 else 0)
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], current)
        else:
            dp[i] = dp[i-1]
    print(n - dp[-1])
```
