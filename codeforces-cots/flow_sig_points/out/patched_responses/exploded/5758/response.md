Okay, let's see. The problem is about determining which cows can show their hands. The condition is that for a cow to be able to show, all other cows must be either ALLIN or FOLDED. And the cow's own status has to be either ALLIN or IN.

So first, let's parse the input. We have n cows, each with a status of A, I, or F. For each cow that's not FOLDED (so either A or I), we need to check if all other cows are either A or F.

Wait, wait. Wait, the condition is: all other players (so excluding the current cow) must be either ALLIN or FOLDED. So for each cow i, if their status is A or I (so they're not folded), then we check the rest of the cows. So for each such cow, we need to count how many of the other cows are not in A or F. Because if there's even one other cow that's not in A or F (i.e., is I), then the current cow can't show.

Wait, the other cows' statuses need to be either ALLIN (A) or FOLDED (F). So any other cow that's IN (I) would invalidate the current cow's possibility to show.

So the steps to solve this:

1. Count the number of 'I's in the entire list. Also, count the number of 'I's and 'A's and 'F's.

But for each candidate cow (those that are not F), we have to check if all others (excluding itself) are either A or F.

So for a cow at position i:

If the cow's status is F, skip.

Otherwise (A or I), we need to check if all other cows are A or F. But how to do this efficiently?

The straightforward approach would be for each non-F cow, check all other cows. But with n up to 2e5, that's O(n^2) which is way too slow.

So we need a smarter way.

Let me think: the condition is that for a cow i (A or I), all other cows must be A or F.

So the problem reduces to: how many non-F cows are there where the number of non-A/F cows in the entire list (excluding themselves) is zero.

Wait, but the other cows must be A or F. So, for cow i, the rest (n-1 cows) must have all A or F.

So let's precompute the total number of non-A/F cows in the entire array. Because non-A/F is 'I's. So the total I count is, say, total_Is.

Now, when considering cow i:

If the cow is not F (i.e., is A or I), then for it to be allowed, the total_Is minus (if the cow itself is I, subtract 1) must be zero.

Wait, no. Because the other cows (all except i) must have no Is. So total_Is minus (1 if i is I) must be equal to the number of Is in other cows.

So, for cow i:

If the cow is F: skip.

Else (A or I):

The other cows must have no Is. So total_Is in the entire array must be equal to 0, if the current cow is not I. Or if the current cow is I, then the total_Is must be 1 (since the current cow is the only I, and others have 0).

Wait, let me rephrase:

The total number of I's in the entire array is total_Is.

For a cow i which is A or I:

The number of I's in other cows is total_Is - (1 if cow i is I else 0). This must be zero for the condition to hold.

Because the other cows can't have any I's. So for the current cow i (if it's allowed to be considered), the other cows must have zero I's.

So the condition is: (total_Is - (1 if i is I else 0)) == 0.

So for each non-F cow i:

Check if (total_Is - (current cow is I ? 1 : 0)) == 0.

If yes, then this cow can show.

So the algorithm would be:

- Count the total number of I's in the array. Let's call it total_I.

- For each cow in the array:

   - If status is F: skip.

   - Else:

      - If total_I - (1 if current cow is I else 0) == 0 â†’ increment the answer.

So this is O(n) time, which is acceptable.

Let's test this logic against the examples.

First example:

Input: 6, AFFAAA â†’ the string is A, F, F, A, A, A.

So the statuses are [A, F, F, A, A, A].

total_I is zero, because there are no I's.

For each non-F cow (positions 0,3,4,5):

Each of them is A, so when checking, total_I (0) minus 0 (since cow is A) is 0. So all of them are valid. So answer is 4. Which matches the first sample.

Second example:

Input 3, AFI â†’ statuses A, F, I.

total_I is 1 (the third cow).

Now, check each non-F cow:

First cow is A: check if total_I - 0 (since it's A) == 0 â†’ 1-0=1â‰ 0. So no.

Third cow is I: check if total_I (1) -1 (since it's I) â†’ 0. So yes.

So answer is 1, which matches the sample.

Another test case: if there are two I's. Then, no cows can be counted. Because for any non-F cow, the total_I - (1 if I) would be 2-1=1 (if the cow is I), or 2-0=2 (if cow is A). Either way, not zero. So answer is zero.

Another case: a single I. Then, for that I, total_I is 1. So 1-1=0 â†’ valid. So that I can be counted. But also any A's. Because for an A, total_I is 1, so 1-0=1â‰ 0. So only the I can be counted. For example, input "I" would not be possible because nâ‰¥2, but say n=2 and input "IA". Then total_I is 1. For the I cow: 1-1=0 â†’ valid. For the A cow: 1-0=1â‰ 0 â†’ invalid. So answer is 1.

So this logic seems to work.

So the steps are:

1. Count the total number of I's in the input.

2. For each character in the input:

   a. if it's F: skip.

   b. else (A or I):

      i. calculate required_Is = total_Is - (1 if current is I else 0)

      ii. if required_Is == 0 â†’ count this cow.

So the code can be written as:

Read n.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    s = input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").strip()

    total_I = s.count('I')

    count = 0

    for c in s:

       if c == 'F':

          continue

       # else, check if other I's are zero.

       # required_Is is total_I minus (1 if current is I)

       required_Is = total_I - (1 if c == 'I' else 0)

       if required_Is == 0:

          count +=1

    print(count, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
3
AFI
""",
            "output": \
"""\
1
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Second sample:

s is 'AFI' â†’ total_I=1.

The first character is A â†’ required_Is=1-0=1 â†’ no. The F is skipped. The third character I: required_Is=1-1=0 â†’ yes. So count is 1.

Another test case: n=2, s='II' â†’ total_I=2. For each I, required_Is is 2-1=1 â†’ not zero. So answer 0.

Another case: n=2, s='AI' â†’ total_I=1. The A: required_Is=1-0=1 â†’ no. The I: 1-1=0 â†’ yes. So answer 1.

Yes. So this code should work.

Now, considering the constraints. The code runs in O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.

Memory usage is also minimal. So this should be the optimal solution.

```python
n = int(input())
s = input().strip()
total_i = s.count('I')
count = 0
for c in s:
    if c == 'F':
        continue
    required = total_i - (1 if c == 'I' else 0)
    if required == 0:
        count += 1
print(count)
```
