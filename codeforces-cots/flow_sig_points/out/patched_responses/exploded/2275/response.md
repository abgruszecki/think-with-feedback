Okay, I need to solve this problem. Let's read the problem carefully.

The problem is about a card game where you can earn coins by playing pairs of the same type. The deck has n cards, each of k types (n and k are even). The initial step is to draw k cards from the top. Then, each turn:

1. Play two cards of the same type to get a coin.
2. Draw two more from the deck if it's not empty.
3. The game ends when both hand and deck are empty.

The goal is to find the maximum coins possible.

Hmm. Let's think about the process. The key is to maximize the number of pairs. Each pair gives a coin. But the order in which you play the pairs might affect how many you can form, especially considering the cards drawn later.

Let's consider the structure of the game. The initial hand has k cards. Then, each turn after playing two cards, you draw two from the deck (if possible). So the total number of turns is (n - k + k) / 2 ? Wait, wait. Wait, initial hand is k cards, which is even. Then each turn you play two cards, so the hand size decreases by two. But after that, if the deck isn't empty, you draw two, so the hand size goes back to the same as before (since you subtract two, add two). But when the deck becomes empty, after playing two, you don't draw. So the number of turns is (number of initial cards plus the possible draws) divided by 2.

But perhaps the key is to model the state of the hand and deck as the game progresses. But with n up to 1000, a dynamic programming approach might be feasible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a greedy approach here. Like, whenever possible, pair up the same types first. But I need to think of possible scenarios where a greedy approach would fail.

Wait, but the problem is that the cards in the hand can be paired in any order, but future draws might have pairs that could be better saved for later. For example, if you have two pairs of type A, but the deck has more A's that could be paired. But if you play them now, you might miss out on forming more pairs later.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to pair as many as possible, regardless of future draws. Because each pair gives a coin, and delaying pairing might not help if there's no way to form more pairs later.

Wait, but the deck is processed in order. So the initial hand is the first k cards, then you draw two each time. So the order in which the deck is processed is fixed. So perhaps the problem can be modeled by keeping track of the current hand, and the next cards to draw, but this might not be feasible for n=1000.

Alternative approach: Since the deck is processed in a fixed order (top to bottom), perhaps the process is deterministic. The initial hand is the first k cards. Then, after each play of two cards, you draw the next two from the deck. So the sequence of draws is fixed. So the problem reduces to selecting pairs from the initial hand and the drawn pairs in a way that maximizes the total.

But how do the cards flow? Let me think:

At each turn, you have a current hand. You choose two cards to play. Then, if there are still cards in the deck, you draw two, adding them to your hand. The next turn's hand is the remaining cards plus the new two (if any). So the order in which you process the initial and drawn cards matters.

But tracking all possible hands would be impossible for n=1000. So we need a smarter way.

Let me think about the structure. Let's model the process as follows:

The game starts with the first k cards (hand). Then, for each step:

- Remove two cards (a pair if possible), add a coin if they are the same.

- Then, if there are cards left in the deck (which starts with n -k cards), draw two from the top, add to hand.

This repeats until both the hand and deck are empty.

But the order in which you remove the two cards affects the possible pairs in the future. For example, suppose you have two A's and two B's. If you pair the A's first, but in the next step you draw two A's, you can pair those. Alternatively, if you pair B's first and then pair the A's. But the total coins would be the same in this case.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as:

Each time you have a hand of cards, which is made up of the initial k cards, plus two each time you draw. But each time you play two cards, the choice of which two to play affects the remaining cards. To maximize the coins, we need to choose pairs optimally.

But how can we model this? Let's think of the process as stages. Each stage (turn) involves playing two cards and possibly drawing two more. The deck is processed in order, so the two drawn each time are fixed (the next two in the deck). So after the initial hand, the deck has (n -k) cards. Since each time two are drawn, and n is even, the number of times you can draw is (n -k)/2. So the total number of stages is (k + 2 * t) / 2, where t is the number of draws. Wait, perhaps the number of stages is (k/2) + ( (n-k)/2 ), since each stage removes two cards. Let's see: initial hand is k cards. Each turn, two are removed. Each time you draw two, but you can draw only (n -k)/2 times, adding two each time. So total cards processed are k + 2 * (number of draws) = k + (n -k) ) = n. So total stages are n / 2, since each stage removes two. For example, in the first example: 4 cards, k=2. So initial hand is 2. Then two are played. The deck has 2 cards, but since after playing two, you check the deck. The deck is not empty, so you draw two. But then your hand is now two again, play again, then deck is empty. Wait, initial hand is 2. Play two, then draw two (since deck has 2). Then hand has two again, play them. Now deck is empty. So total stages are (4 cards) / 2 per stage = 2 stages. So the initial hand is 2, then after first play you draw 2, then play again.

But the deck is processed in order, so the two cards drawn each time are fixed. So the problem is to model how the hand evolves, considering which two cards are played at each step, given that new cards are added in a fixed order.

Hmm. So the hand after each step is a combination of remaining cards from previous steps and new drawn cards. But for n=1000, the maximum possible steps is 500. So perhaps a dynamic programming approach where we track the state of the hand and the position in the deck (i.e., how many cards have been drawn so far) could be feasible. But the state would need to track the counts of each type in the current hand, which could be up to k types, and each count can be up to, say, the initial count plus possible additions. But with k up to 1000, that's not feasible.

Wait, but perhaps the order in which the cards are drawn is fixed. So after the initial k cards, the next two are added each time. So the problem can be viewed as the hand starts with the first k cards. Then, after each play of two cards, we add the next two from the deck. So the process is determined by which two cards are played at each step, and the added cards are fixed.

So the challenge is to model the state of the hand at each step, and for each possible state, track the maximum coins so far.

But even then, the state of the hand could be quite large. For example, if there are k types, each with a count in the hand, but the sum of counts is the current hand size (which starts at k, then after each play, it's (hand size -2) + 2 (if drawn), so after each play, the hand size is same as before (if drawn), else decreases by 2.

But this seems complicated. Let's think of another approach.

Alternative idea: The maximum number of coins is equal to the total possible pairs in the entire deck, but with some constraints based on the order in which cards are drawn and played. For example, you can't pair two cards that are in the deck but not drawn until after their possible pairs have been used.

Wait, but the deck is processed in order. So the first k cards are the initial hand. Then, each time you play two cards, you add the next two from the deck, in order. So the entire deck is processed in batches of two, after each play.

So the order in which the deck is processed is fixed. So perhaps the problem can be broken down into the initial hand and the sequence of two-card draws. Then, the problem is to choose pairs to play in each step such that the sum of coins is maximized.

But how do the choices affect future steps? For example, if I have a pair in the initial hand, playing them now gives a coin, but maybe if I save one of them for a later pair that comes from the deck, I can get more coins.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal approach is to greedily pair as many as possible as early as possible. Because once a pair is available, not using it could prevent forming a pair later if the other cards are used in other pairs.

But how can we model this?

Another approach: Let's consider that each time two cards are drawn, they are added to the current hand. So the hand is a collection of cards that can be used in any order, as long as they are in the hand. So the problem is similar to a sliding window of possible cards. But given that the order of drawing is fixed, perhaps we can model the hand as a collection of cards that have been drawn up to a certain point, and then find the best way to pair them.

But even this seems difficult. Let's think of the problem in terms of possible pairs.

Each pair is two cards of the same type. The maximum possible coins is the sum over all types of floor(count[type]/2). However, the order of processing may prevent this maximum. For example, if two cards of the same type are in the deck, but when they are drawn, their possible pairs have already been used.

For instance, in the first example:

4 2

1 2 1 2

The initial hand is [1, 2]. You have to play two cards. They are different, so no coin. Then you draw the next two (1,2). Now your hand is [1,2]. Play them, again no coin. So total 0.

But the maximum possible pairs is (two 1's and two 2's), which would be 2. But the way the cards are drawn and played makes this impossible.

So the problem is not just about the counts of each type, but the order in which they can be paired.

This suggests that the problem requires considering the order of play and the availability of pairs as the deck is processed.

So the key is to model the hand and the sequence of draws, and for each step, choose the best two cards to play to maximize the total.

But with n up to 1000, how can we model this efficiently?

Let's think of the process as follows:

The initial hand is the first k cards. Then, for each step t from 0 to m-1 (where m is the number of steps), you have:

At step t, the deck has (n - k - 2t) cards left. Wait, no. Because after each step, two cards are drawn from the deck. So the deck starts with (n -k) cards. Each step after the first play, you draw two. So the number of draws possible is (n -k)/2. Because each draw takes two cards. So the total steps (plays) are (k/2 + (n -k)/2) ) = n/2. Which makes sense, since all n cards are played.

So the steps are as follows:

1. Initial hand: first k cards. Deck has (n -k) cards. Step 0.

2. Play two cards. Then, if deck is not empty, draw two (next two in order). Step 1.

3. Repeat until all cards are played.

So the process has s = n/2 steps, since each step plays two cards.

Now, the deck is processed in order. So the first two cards after the initial hand are added after the first play, then the next two after the next play, etc.

So the problem can be modeled by the order in which the deck is processed, and the way pairs are formed from the current hand at each step.

But how to model the hand's state?

An alternative idea is that the hand consists of:

At step i, the hand is the initial k cards minus any played in previous steps, plus the first 2i drawn from the deck. Wait, no. Because each step after the initial, you can draw two cards. So for step 0 (the first play), the hand is the initial k. After playing two, if deck is not empty, you draw two. So after step 0, if deck had at least two cards, the hand is (k-2) + 2 = k cards again. But in the next step, you play two again. So for each step, the hand size is k - 2 * (i) + 2 * (i) = k. Wait, no. Let's see:

Initially, hand is k cards.

Step 0: play two, hand size is k-2. Then draw two (if possible). So if deck is not empty, hand size becomes k-2 + 2 = k again.

So for each step, after playing two, if there are cards left in the deck, draw two, maintaining the hand size at k. Once the deck is empty, after playing two, you don't draw, so the hand size decreases by two each step until it's zero.

Wait, but the deck has (n -k) cards. Each time two are drawn. So the number of draws possible is (n -k) / 2. So after (n -k)/2 steps of drawing, the deck is empty.

But each play is followed by a possible draw, except when the deck is empty.

So the total steps (number of plays) is:

Initially, hand has k cards, which is even. Each play reduces the hand by two. When the deck is empty, after each play, the hand size decreases by two. The total plays are (k + (n -k)) ) / 2 = n/2.

So the process is divided into two phases:

1. During the first (n -k)/2 draws: after each play, two cards are added.

   For these steps, after playing two, the hand size remains k - 2 + 2 = k. So during this phase, the hand size is always k. But the composition changes.

2. After the deck is empty, each play reduces the hand size by two. The hand size starts at k, and after each play, it decreases by two until zero.

So, the maximum number of steps in the first phase is (n -k)/2. Then, the second phase steps are (k - (n -k)) ) / 2? Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, the total cards in the deck is (n -k). So when we have drawn all (n -k) cards (i.e., (n -k)/2 times, two per draw), the deck is empty. So the first phase has (n -k)/2 steps where after playing two, we draw two. Then, after that, each step just plays two from the hand, with no draws.

So the total steps is (n/2) steps, as the total cards is n, and each step uses two.

So during the first (n -k)/2 steps, after each play, two are drawn. Then, the remaining steps (k/2 - (n -k)/2) ) = (k - (n -k))/2 ) = (2k -n)/2 = k -n/2. But since n and k are even, this makes sense.

So for example, if n=8, k=4:

Deck has 4 cards. So after two draws (each of two), the deck is empty.

So steps where you draw are first two plays. Then, the next two plays (since total steps is 4) are in the second phase.

So the initial hand is 4 cards. After first play (step 0), draw two (deck now has 2 left). After second play (step 1), draw two (deck empty). Then step 2: play two, no draw. Step 3: play two, no draw.

So for the first two steps (0 and 1), you draw after each play. For steps 2 and 3, no draws.

So the hand size during steps 0 and 1 remains 4 (since each play removes two, then draws two). Then, after that, steps 2 and 3 reduce the hand size by two each.

Now, the problem is to model the hand at each step, but considering which cards are available and how to pair them optimally.

But for n up to 1000, the maximum steps is 500. For each step, the hand can have up to k cards. But k can be up to 1000. So how can we model this efficiently?

An alternative idea is to represent the hand as a frequency count of each type, and track the maximum possible coins for each state. However, the state would be the current step (how many cards have been drawn so far) and the frequency counts of the current hand. But with k up to 1000, this is not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a greedy approach. For example, at each step, play a pair if possible, to get a coin. But this might not always be optimal.

But when would a greedy approach fail? For example, if there's a choice between two pairs, and choosing one now leads to more pairs later. For example:

Suppose current hand has two A's and two B's. The next two cards to draw are A and B. If you play the two A's now, then in the next step you have two B's and the new cards (A and B). Then you can pair B's, then the next two (A and B) can be paired as well. That's 3 coins.

Alternatively, if you play B's first, then next step you have two A's plus A and B. Then play A's, then B's. Also 3 coins. So same result.

But what if the next two cards are two A's?

Wait, initial hand: two A's and two B's. Next two cards to draw are two A's. If I play two A's now: then I get a coin. Then draw two A's. Now hand is two B's and two A's. Play two A's again (another coin). Then draw two (if any). But perhaps the deck is empty. Then, after that, play B's. Total coins: 2 (from A's) + 1 (from B's) = 3.

If instead, play B's first: coin. Then draw two A's. Hand is two A's and two A's. Play two A's (coin), then two A's (another coin). Total coins: 3. Same.

So in this case, the order of pairing doesn't matter.

But what about a more complex scenario:

Current hand: A, A, B, B.

Next two cards to draw: B, B.

If you play A's now:

Coin for A's. Then add B, B. Hand becomes B, B, B, B. Then play two B's (coin), then two B's (another coin). Total coins: 3.

If you play B's first:

Coin for B's. Then add B, B. Hand becomes A, A, B, B. Then play A's (coin), then B's (coin). Total coins: 3. Same.

So again, the order doesn't matter.

Hmm. Maybe the greedy approach of pairing as many as possible each step is optimal. Because each pair contributes a coin, and any delay in pairing may not help, as future pairs can still be formed.

But why?

Wait, perhaps the maximum possible coins is equal to the maximum possible pairs that can be formed in the entire sequence, but constrained by the order in which cards are available.

But how to compute this?

Another idea: the problem is equivalent to selecting pairs of cards such that, for any pair, the two cards are in the hand at the same time. The cards are added in a fixed order (the initial k, then two each step). So the pairs must be formed from cards that are present in the hand during the same step.

So the maximum coins is the maximum number of such pairs that can be selected without overlapping.

But how to model this?

Alternatively, perhaps the process can be viewed as a sequence of hands. The initial hand is first k cards. Then, each step adds the next two cards from the deck (if possible) and subtracts two played cards. The maximum coins is the sum of pairs chosen at each step.

But how to model this sequence.

Wait, perhaps we can model the problem with dynamic programming, where the state is the current index in the deck (i.e., how many two-card groups have been drawn so far) and the current hand's frequency counts. For each state, we track the maximum coins possible up to that point.

But for k up to 1000 and deck size up to 1000, this could be feasible if the state representation is manageable.

But for example, if the current hand is a frequency dictionary, the state would be the counts of each type. However, with k types (up to 1000), the state space would be too large. For example, if there are 1000 types, each count can be up to 1000 (since the hand size is up to 1000). So this is not feasible.

Alternative approach: Since the hand size is fixed during the first phase (k cards), maybe the order in which pairs are played doesn't affect the possibility of forming other pairs as long as the counts are even.

Wait, perhaps not. For example, if you have 3 A's and 1 B in the hand. You can't pair all. So you need to play two A's now, leaving one A and one B, then next step draw two more. But if the next two are B and B, then you can pair them. So total coins would be 1 (A's) + 1 (B's) = 2.

Alternatively, if you could pair B's first, but that's impossible. So in this case, the choice is forced.

But perhaps the maximum possible pairs is determined by the sum of floor(count[type]/2) for each type. But constrained by the order in which cards are available.

Alternatively, think about the entire sequence of cards that are available in the hand over time. The initial hand plus the drawn cards. For each type, the number of possible pairs is the number of pairs that can be formed in the entire sequence, but each pair's two elements must be in the hand at the same time.

But how to model this?

Alternatively, consider that when you draw two new cards, they are added to the current hand. So for each step, you have a new hand that's the previous hand minus two played cards plus two new (if drawn). The problem is to select two cards to play each step, to maximize the sum of coins.

But with n up to 1000 and steps up to 500, and for each step, possible choices (which two cards to play) being up to (hand size choose 2) which can be large, it's challenging.

But perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming, using the current counts of each type and the number of steps taken so far. However, the state would be the counts for each type, which is not feasible for k=1000.

Alternative idea: The maximum number of coins is the sum of the minimum of the number of pairs available in the initial hand and the possible pairs added by the deck.

Wait, but the deck is processed in order. So when you draw two cards, they are added to the hand. So the hand at any step is the initial hand minus some pairs played, plus the drawn cards up to that step.

But perhaps the optimal strategy is to pair as many as possible in the initial hand, then as the new cards are added, pair as many as possible again.

But how to handle overlapping pairs.

Alternatively, think of it as each time you add two new cards, you can pair any two in the current hand, including the new ones. The best way to maximize the pairs is to pair as many as possible each time.

But in this case, the greedy approach of pairing as many as possible each step would be optimal.

But how to test this?

Let's look at the examples.

First example:

Input:

4 2

1 2 1 2

Initial hand: [1,2]. Possible pairs: none. So play any two (no coin). Then draw [1,2]. Again, no pairs. So total coins 0. Which matches the output.

Second example:

8 2

2 1 2 2 1 2 1 2

Initial hand: [2,1,2,2]. So counts are 2:3, 1:1. Possible pairs: two 2's. Pair them. Get 1 coin. Then draw the next two: 1,2. Hand becomes [1,2,2,1,2]. Wait, initial hand after first play: after removing two 2's (count becomes 1), add two drawn (1 and 2). So new hand is [1,2,1,2,2]?

Wait, initial hand is 4 cards. After playing two, you have two left. Then add two, making four again. Then play two again.

Wait, maybe the order in which you remove the two cards affects the hand. For example, in the initial hand [2,1,2,2], possible pairs are two 2's. So after playing them, the hand is [1,2]. Then you draw two (1 and 2), making the hand [1,2,1,2]. Then play two (e.g., 1 and 1, 2 and 2, but no). So no coins. Then draw two more (1,2), making the hand [1,2,1,2]. Then play two again. No coins. Then no more cards. So total coins is 1.

Which matches the sample output.

But what if there was a way to pair later cards?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible is indeed 1 in this case.

So the greedy approach of pairing whenever possible seems to work here.

Another example:

Third example:

4 4

1 2 1 2

Initial hand: all four cards. So two pairs. Play both pairs, get two coins. Output is 2. Which matches.

Fourth example:

6 4

3 2 3 1 2 1

The initial hand is 3,2,3,1. Counts: 3:2, 2:1, 1:1. Pair the two 3's for a coin. Then draw two cards: 2 and 1. Hand becomes 2,1,2,1. Pair 2 and 2 (no, they are not in the hand). Wait, after initial play of two 3's, the hand is 2,1. Then you draw 2 and 1, making the hand [2,1,2,1]. Now, possible pairs: 2 and 2, 1 and 1. Play those two pairs, two coins. Then deck has two left (1), but wait the original input is 6 cards. So n=6, k=4. The deck has 6-4=2 cards. So after the first play, you draw those two. Then the deck is empty. So after playing those two pairs (in two steps), you have no cards left. So total coins is 1 + 2 =3. Which matches the output.

So the greedy approach works here.

Another example:

Input:

6 4

3 2 3 3 2 1

Initial hand: 3,2,3,3. Counts: 3:3, 2:1. Play two 3's (coin 1). Then hand is 3,2. Draw next two: 2,1. Hand becomes 3,2,2,1. Now, possible pairs: 2 and 2. Play them (coin 2). Then deck is empty. Hand is 3,1. Play them (no coin). So total 2. Which matches the sample.

So the greedy approach of pairing as possible each time works.

But what about a case where delaying a pair could lead to more coins?

Suppose:

Initial hand: 1,1,2,2.

Deck has two cards: 2,2.

If you pair 1's and 2's now:

First step: pair 1's (coin 1). Hand becomes 2,2. Draw two 2's. Hand is 2,2,2,2. Next step: pair two 2's (coin 2). Then two 2's (coin 3). So total 3.

Alternatively, if you pair 2's first:

Step 1: pair 2's (coin 1). Hand is 1,1,2. Then draw two 2's. Hand is 1,1,2,2,2. Wait, no. Wait, initial hand is 4 cards. After playing two 2's, hand is 1,1. Then draw two 2's. Hand becomes 1,1,2,2. Now pair 1's (coin 2), then pair 2's (coin 3). Same total.

But what if the deck's cards are 1,1 instead?

Initial hand: 1,1,2,2.

Deck: 1,1.

If we pair 1's now:

Hand becomes 2,2. Draw 1,1. Hand is 2,2,1,1. Pair 2's (coin 2), then pair 1's (coin 3). Total 3.

If instead, pair 2's first:

Hand becomes 1,1,2. Then draw 1,1. Hand is 1,1,2,1,1. Which is 5 cards. Wait, but the hand size must be even? Because each step plays two cards and draws two (if possible). Wait, no. After the first play of two, the hand is 2 cards (1,1,2,2) minus two 2's → 1,1. Then draw two 1's → hand is 1,1,1,1. Then play two, etc.

Wait, no. Let's think again. 

In this scenario, n=6, k=4. Deck has two cards (1,1).

Step 0: initial hand is [1,1,2,2]. Play two cards. Let's say pair 1's → coin 1. Hand becomes [2,2]. Then draw two 1's → hand is [2,2,1,1]. Step 1: play two 2's → coin 2. Hand becomes [1,1]. Then deck is empty. Step 2: play two 1's → coin 3. Total coins 3.

Alternatively, step 0: pair two 2's. Hand becomes [1,1,2]. Then draw two 1's → hand is [1,1,2,1,1]. But hand size is 5, which is odd. This can't be right. Because according to the problem statement, each step you play exactly two cards. So the initial hand is even, and after each play, the hand size is even minus two, but then adding two (if deck is not empty) brings it back to even. But in this case, after playing two 2's (hand becomes [1,1,2], which is 3 cards?), that's impossible. Wait, no. The initial hand is four cards. After playing two, the hand has two cards (1,1,2,2 minus two 2's → 1,1). Then you add two from the deck (1,1) → hand becomes 1,1 + 1,1 = 4 cards.

So in this case, pairing 2's first leads to:

Step 0: play two 2's → hand is 1,1. Draw two 1's. Hand is 1,1,1,1. Step 1: play two 1's (coin 1). Step 2: play two 1's (coin 2). Then deck is empty, no more steps. Total coins 1+2=3. Same as before.

So the order of pairing doesn't matter in this case.

Another scenario where delaying could help:

Initial hand: 1,1,1,1. Deck has 2,2,2,2.

If I pair two 1's in the first step, then draw two 2's. Hand is 1,1,2,2. Pair two 1's again (coin 2), draw two 2's. Hand is 2,2,2,2. Pair two 2's, then two 2's → total coins 4.

If I instead, pair 1's first, same result.

But what if the deck has 1,1,2,2, etc.?

Hmm. It seems that the order in which pairs are played doesn't affect the total maximum possible coins, as long as you pair as much as possible each step.

Therefore, the greedy approach of pairing any two cards of the same type each step is optimal. So the solution is to simulate the process and count the maximum possible coins by greedily pairing any possible pairs at each step.

But how to implement this efficiently?

The problem is that for each step, we need to select two cards of the same type from the current hand. To maximize the total coins, we should choose to pair as many as possible. But how to model the hand and track which cards are left.

But the problem allows us to choose any two cards of the same type. So for each step, the maximum possible coins is to select any pair available, and the choice of which pair to select first doesn't affect the total count.

So the optimal strategy is to count the number of pairs for each type in the current hand, choose to pair one pair (any type), and proceed. For example, for the current hand's frequency counts, we can take any type with at least two cards, subtract two from its count, and add one to the coins.

Thus, the maximum coins can be computed by maintaining a frequency dictionary for the current hand. For each step:

1. Find all types with count >= 2.

2. Select one pair (the choice of type may not matter, as we want to maximize the total pairs over all steps).

3. Subtract two from the chosen type's count.

4. Add one coin.

5. If there are cards left in the deck, add the next two cards to the frequency counts.

Repeat until the hand is empty.

But the problem is that the choice of which pair to take at each step may affect future steps. For example, choosing to pair a type with two cards now may prevent having three cards of another type in the future, which could form two pairs.

But based on the earlier examples, perhaps the greedy approach of always pairing any available pair is optimal.

Alternatively, the optimal strategy is to pair the type with the maximum current count first. For example, if a type has three cards in the hand, pairing it now will leave one card, which may pair with future cards. Or perhaps pairing the type with the least count first.

But how to determine which choice is better.

This suggests that a dynamic programming approach is needed, but with n=1000 and steps=500, and possible states, this may not be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum coins can be determined by considering the frequency of each type over all cards that can be present in the hand at any step.

But how?

Another idea: the entire sequence of cards processed is the initial k cards plus the remaining (n-k) cards in order. So all the cards are processed, and the hand at each step is a subset of these cards. So the maximum coins is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed such that the two cards in each pair are in the same hand at the same time.

This is equivalent to selecting pairs such that for each pair, both cards are in the hand during some step. And each pair must be disjoint (each card can be used in at most one pair).

So the problem reduces to finding the maximum matching in this way.

But how to compute this.

This seems like a problem that can be modeled with a graph where edges represent possible pairs, and the maximum matching is what we need. However, the complexity of such a model is prohibitive for n=1000.

Alternative approach: simulate the process and greedily pair as many as possible each step.

To implement this, we can represent the current hand as a frequency dictionary. For each step:

1. Check if any type has at least two cards. If yes, increment the coins by one, subtract two from that type's count.

2. If no pairs are possible, select any two cards (different types), subtract one from each, no coin.

3. Add the next two cards from the deck (if any).

But how to choose which pair to take in step 1.

If there are multiple types with pairs, which one to choose.

The choice may affect future steps. For example:

Current hand has two pairs (A and B). Next two cards to draw are A and A. If you pair B now, then after adding the two A's, you have three A's. You can't pair all of them. But if you pair A now, then after adding A and A, you have two A's and two B's. Then you can pair both.

So choosing to pair A now would yield two coins, whereas pairing B now would yield one.

So in this case, the choice of which pair to take first affects the total.

Thus, the greedy approach of pairing any available pair may not be optimal.

Thus, we need a way to model the state of the hand and the current position in the deck, and for each state, track the maximum coins possible.

But how to do this.

The state can be represented as the current deck index (i.e., how many two-card draws have been made so far) and the frequency counts of the current hand.

But with deck index up to (n -k)/2 = 500 steps, and frequency counts that could be up to k/2 for each type, this is not feasible for k=1000.

Alternative idea: For each step, the hand consists of the initial k cards plus the first 2i cards drawn from the deck. So the hand at step i is a combination of the initial k cards and the first 2i cards drawn.

But each step after i requires that two cards are played from the hand.

So the problem can be modeled as follows:

At each step, the hand is the initial k cards plus the first 2i drawn cards, minus the pairs played in previous steps.

But how to track this.

Another observation: the process is deterministic once the pairs chosen at each step are determined. So the maximum coins is determined by the sequence of pairs chosen.

But even with this, the problem requires considering all possible choices of pairs at each step, which is not feasible for large n and k.

Alternative idea: the maximum coins is equal to the sum of the minimum between the number of pairs in the initial hand and the pairs formed from the deck, but this seems unclear.

Alternatively, for each type, the maximum possible pairs is the minimum between the number of cards of that type in the entire deck and the number of pairs that can be formed given the order of processing.

But this is not straightforward.

Perhaps a dynamic programming approach is needed. Here's an outline:

We can model the problem as follows:

At each step i, which corresponds to the i-th time we've drawn two cards from the deck (if possible), the state is the current frequency counts of the hand. The DP state would track the maximum coins possible up to this point.

For each step, for each possible state (frequency counts), we can choose to pair any two cards of the same type, then update the frequency counts and move to the next step.

But with n=1000, k=1000, and steps up to 500, this would be computationally intensive.

But maybe there's a way to optimize this. For example, the hand size is k during the first phase (drawing phase), and then decreases by two each step.

But even with this, the state space would be huge.

Alternative Idea:

The process can be viewed in terms of the initial hand and the deck. The initial hand has k cards. Each time we play two cards, we can choose any pair. Then, we draw two more (if available) from the deck. The goal is to maximize the number of pairs.

But the deck is processed in order, so the two cards added each time are fixed. So perhaps we can model the process by keeping track of the current hand's frequency counts, and for each step, process the next two cards from the deck.

At each step, the possible actions are to choose any pair from the current hand (if possible), leading to a new state (hand minus two of that type), then add the next two cards.

But how to implement this.

Let's try to think of the steps:

Initialize hand as the first k cards.

For each step from 0 to (n -k)/2 steps:

   Play a pair from the current hand (if possible), incrementing coins.

   Add the next two cards from the deck to the hand.

After all deck cards are drawn, process the remaining hand by pairing as much as possible.

But how to handle cases where there's no pairs available in the current hand.

Wait, the problem says that you have to choose exactly two cards each turn, even if they are not a pair (but you earn a coin only if they are a pair).

So even if there are no pairs, you must play two cards (any two). So during the steps where the deck is not empty, after playing two cards (whether pair or not), you draw two new.

So the process is:

Initial hand: k cards.

For steps in the drawing phase (deck not empty):

   Choose two cards to play. If they are same type, add a coin.

   Draw next two cards.

Repeat until deck is empty.

Then, process the remaining cards by playing two at a time (no draws).

So the challenge is to choose which two cards to play at each step to maximize the total coins.

This is a decision problem where each decision (which two cards to play) affects future decisions.

To model this, dynamic programming is needed. The state must include the current hand's frequency counts and the position in the deck.

But for large k and n, this is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: For each step, after adding the new two cards, the maximum possible pairs is the sum of floor(count[t]/2) for all types t. But this is not possible because the order of playing pairs affects the availability of cards for future pairs.

But perhaps, during the drawing phase (when deck is not empty), the optimal strategy is to play as many pairs as possible each time. Because after each play, you have two new cards, so any pairs in the new cards can be formed.

But even this may not be optimal.

Alternatively, the maximum number of coins is equal to the sum over all types of the number of pairs in the entire sequence of cards, minus the number of pairs that are split between different hands.

But how to compute this.

Another observation: during the drawing phase (deck not empty), after each play, two new cards are added. So the hand size remains k. This phase has (n -k)/2 steps. Then, the remaining cards (k cards) are processed by playing two at a time, but no draws. So during the drawing phase, the hand size is always k. Once the deck is empty, the hand size decreases by two each step.

Thus, the process can be divided into two phases:

1. Drawing phase: (n -k)/2 steps. Each step involves playing two cards (possibly a pair) and adding two new.

2. Non-drawing phase: (k/2) steps. Each step plays two cards (possibly a pair) and no new cards are added.

Thus, the problem can be split into two parts. For the first phase, model the hand after each step, and for the second phase, simply compute the maximum pairs possible in the remaining hand.

But even this requires modeling the first phase, which is challenging.

But perhaps during the first phase, the optimal strategy is to always play a pair if possible, and if not, play any two cards. Because any pairs left in the hand can be used in future steps when new cards are added.

But this may not be the case.

For example:

Hand has 1,1,2,3.

Deck has 2,2,3,3.

If in the first step, we play 1 and 1 (coin 1). Then add 2 and 2 → hand is 2,2,3,3. Next step play 2 and 2 (coin 2). Add 3 and3 → hand is 3,3,3,3. Play two 3's (coin 3), then two 3's (coin 4). Total coins 4.

Alternatively, in the first step, play 1 and 2 (no coin). Add 2,2 → hand is 1,3,2,2. Then play 2 and 2 (coin 1). Add 3,3 → hand is 1,3,3,3. Play 3 and 3 (coin 2), then 1 and3 (no coin). Total coins 2.

So the choice of playing a pair early is better.

Thus, the optimal strategy is to play pairs as soon as possible.

Thus, the greedy approach of always choosing a pair when possible in each step is optimal.

Thus, the solution is to simulate the process:

1. Initialize the hand as the first k cards.

2. For each of the (n-k)/2 steps in the drawing phase:

   a. If there are any pairs in the hand, play one (increment coins by 1), remove two cards of that type.

   b. Else, play any two different cards (no coin).

   c. Add the next two cards from the deck.

3. Once the deck is empty, process the remaining hand by pairing as many as possible.

But how to efficiently simulate this.

The key is to track the counts of each type in the hand. For each step:

- Check if any type has count >= 2.

- If yes, choose that type, decrement its count by 2, and increment coins.

- If no, choose any two different types, decrement each by 1.

- Then add the next two cards from the deck.

But when you have multiple types with count >= 2, which one to choose? The choice may affect future steps. For example, choosing to pair a type with two cards now leaves room for future pairs of another type.

But in the earlier example, it didn't matter. So perhaps any choice of pair is fine as long as a pair is chosen.

Thus, in the simulation, when multiple pairs are possible, we can choose any, and it will yield the maximum coins.

But how to prove this.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of pairs is fixed regardless of the order in which pairs are formed. But this is not true. For example, suppose:

Hand has 2 A's and 2 B's. Deck has two C's.

Step 1: play two A's → coin. Add C's. Hand becomes B's and C's. No pairs. Play B and C → no coin. Step 2: add C's → hand becomes B, C, C. Now, no pairs. So total coins 1.

Alternative scenario: step 1 play B's → coin. Add C's. Hand is A's and C's. No pairs. Play A and C → no coin. Step 2: add C's. Hand becomes A, C, C. No pairs. Total coins 1.

Same result.

But if the deck has different cards.

Hand: 2A, 2B. Deck: A, A.

Step 1: play A's → coin. Add A's. Hand is 2B, 2A. Step 2: play A's → coin. Add no (deck empty). Then play B's → coin. Total 3.

If step 1 play B's → coin. Add A's. Hand is 2A, 2A. Step 2: play A's → 2 coins. Then step 3: play A's → 1 more. Total 3.

So regardless of the order, total coins are the same.

Thus, perhaps the order in which pairs are played during the first phase doesn't affect the total maximum coins. As long as you pair as much as possible each step, the total will be the same.

Thus, the simulation can be done by greedily pairing any available pair.

Thus, the algorithm is:

- Maintain a frequency dictionary for the current hand.

- For each step in the drawing phase:

   - Check if there's any type with count >=2.

   - If yes, select any such type, increment coins by 1, subtract 2 from its count.

   - Else, subtract 1 from two different types (no coin).

   - Add the next two cards from the deck to the frequency dictionary.

- After the deck is empty:

   - For the remaining hand, add floor(count[t] / 2) for each type to the coins.

Thus, the code can be structured as follows:

1. Read the initial k cards and count their frequencies.

2. Read the remaining (n -k) cards into a list, say 'deck'.

3. Initialize 'coins' to 0.

4. For i in 0 to ( (n -k) // 2 ) - 1:

   a. Try to find a type with count >= 2.

   b. If found, coins +=1, count[type] -= 2.

   c. Else, find two different types with count >=1, subtract 1 from each.

   d. Add the next two cards from 'deck' (index 2i and 2i+1) to the counts.

5. After processing all deck draws:

   a. Process the remaining hand by adding floor(count[t] / 2) for all t.

But wait, after the deck is empty, there are k cards left (since each step during the drawing phase adds two and removes two, keeping the hand size at k). Then, in the non-drawing phase, each step removes two cards. So the remaining hand is processed as follows:

For example, if the hand has m cards (initially k), then each step removes two. The maximum coins from this phase is the sum of (count[t] // 2) for all t in the current hand.

Thus, after the deck is empty, the remaining hand can be processed by simply summing count[t] // 2 for all t.

But why?

Because during the non-drawing phase, the hand is processed in steps, each step playing two cards. The optimal way is to play as many pairs as possible. So the maximum coins possible in this phase is exactly the sum of floor(count[t]/2) for all types.

Thus, the code can be implemented as follows.

Now, let's test this logic with the first example:

Example 1:

n=4, k=2.

Initial hand: [1, 2]. count = {1:1, 2:1}.

Deck has 2 cards: [1, 2].

Steps in the drawing phase: (n -k)/2 = (4-2)/2 = 1 step.

Step i=0:

Check for pairs: none.

So subtract one from two different types. count becomes {1:0, 2:0}.

Add the next two cards (1,2). count is {1:1, 2:1}.

After this step, deck is empty.

Processing the remaining hand: sum (1//2 + 1//2) = 0. Coins remains 0.

Thus, the output is 0.

Which matches the sample.

Another example: input 3:

4 4

1 2 1 2.

Initial hand: 4 cards. count {1:2, 2:2}.

Drawing phase steps: (4-4)/2 =0 steps. So no steps. Proceed to non-drawing phase.

Sum 2//2 + 2//2 = 1 +1 = 2. So coins 2. Which matches.

Example 2:

n=8, k=2.

deck has 6 cards: [2,1,2,1,2,1,2]. Wait, original input is 8 2, the sequence is 2 1 2 2 1 2 1 2.

Wait, the initial hand is the first k=2 cards: [2,1]. count {2:1, 1:1}.

Deck has 6 cards: [2,2,1,2,1,2].

Steps in drawing phase: (8-2)/2 =3 steps.

Step 0:

No pairs in hand.

Play two different cards. Subtract 1 from each. count becomes {2:0, 1:0}.

Add next two cards: 2 and 2. count {2:2}.

coins remains 0.

Step 1:

Check for pairs. 2 has count 2. coins +=1. count becomes 0.

Add next two cards: 1 and 2. count {1:1, 2:1}.

Step 2:

No pairs. Play two different. subtract 1 from each. count becomes 0.

Add next two cards: 1 and 2. count {1:1, 2:1}.

Deck is now empty.

Processing remaining hand: sum 0. So total coins 1.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the logic works for this case.

Another example: input 5.

6 4

3 2 3 3 2 1.

Initial hand: 3,2,3,3 → count {3:3, 2:1}.

Deck has 2 cards: 2,1.

Steps in drawing phase: (6-4)/2 =1 step.

Step 0:

Find a pair. 3 has 3 >=2. coins +=1. count {3:1, 2:1}.

Add 2 and 1 → count {3:1, 2:2, 1:1}.

Deck is empty.

Processing remaining hand: sum 3//2 (1//2=0), 2//2=1, 1//2=0 → total 1. coins +=1 → total 2. Which matches the sample.

Thus, the code logic works.

Now, how to implement this.

Implementation Steps:

1. Read n and k.

2. Read the array a of n elements.

3. Split into initial_hand (first k elements) and deck (remaining elements).

4. Count frequencies for initial_hand.

5. Process each of the (n -k) / 2 steps in the drawing phase:

   For each step i from 0 to ( (n -k)//2 ) -1:

      a. Check if there's any type with count >= 2.

      b. If yes, select the first such type (order might not matter), increment coins by 1, subtract 2 from count.

      c. If not, subtract 1 from two different types.

      d. Add the next two cards from deck (at positions 2*i and 2*i+1) to the count.

6. After processing all steps in the drawing phase, process the remaining hand:

   coins += sum( (count[t] // 2) for all t in count )

7. Output coins.

Now, in step 5b, the choice of which type to select when multiple types have pairs may affect the outcome. But earlier examples suggest that any choice leads to the same total coins. So for the simulation, we can choose any type, like the first one encountered.

To efficiently find a pair, we can iterate through the keys of the count dictionary and check for counts >=2.

But in Python, dictionaries do not preserve order. However, since the order may not matter, we can iterate through the keys in any order.

But to handle this, for each step, we can iterate through the count dictionary and pick the first type with count >=2.

Implementing this:

def find_pair(count):

    for key in count:

        if count[key] >=2:

            return key

    return None

Thus, in each step, we check for any key in the count with count >=2. Once found, subtract 2 and increment coins.

If no pair is found, select two different types and subtract 1 from each. To do this, we can collect the types with count >=1 and subtract from the first two.

For example:

keys = [t for t in count if count[t] >0]

if len(keys) >=2:

   count[keys[0]] -=1

   count[keys[1]] -=1

else:

   # impossible, since hand has even size.

But since the hand size is always even (during the drawing phase, we add two and subtract two, maintaining even size. In non-drawing phase, we subtract two each step.), the code should always find two different types when needed.

But during the drawing phase steps, after each step, the hand size is k. So during step processing, if there are no pairs, there must be at least two different types with count >=1.

Thus, the code can proceed.

Now, let's code this.

But for efficiency, we can represent the count as a dictionary.

Let's test the code with example 6:

Input:

18 6

5 6 1 1 6 5 4 1 5 1 1 6 2 6 2 2 6 3

Initial hand: first 6 elements: [5,6,1,1,6,5]

Count:

5:2, 6:2, 1:2.

Coins += 2 (5's pair) + 2 (6's pair) + 2 (1's pair) → no, wait, wait. Wait, during the initial hand processing in the first steps.

Wait, the initial hand is 6 cards. The drawing phase steps are (18-6)/2 =6 steps.

Let's see.

Initial count:

5:2, 6:2, 1:2.

 coins =0.

During each step:

Step 0:

Find a pair. All three types have counts >=2. Choose any, say 5. coins +=1, count[5] becomes 0.

Add next two cards:4 and 1. count becomes 6:2, 1:3, 4:1.

Step 1:

Find a pair:6 has 2. coins +=1 (total 2), count[6] becomes 0. Add next two:5 and 1. count becomes 1:4,4:1,5:1.

Step 2:

Find pair:1 has 4 >=2. coins +=1 (3). subtract 2: count[1] = 2. add next two:1 and 6. count:1:3, 4:1,5:1, 6:1.

Step 3:

Find pair:1 has 3. no. wait 3 >=2. yes. coins +=1 (4). subtract 2: count[1]=1. add next two:2 and 6. count:1:1,4:1,5:1,6:2, 2:1.

Step4:

Find pair:6 has 2. coins +=1 (5). subtract 2:6:0. add next two:2 and 2. count:1:1,4:1,5:1,2:3.

Step5:

Find pair:2 has 3 >=2. coins +=1 (6). subtract 2: 2:1. add next two:6 and3. count:1:1,4:1,5:1,2:1,6:1,3:1.

Deck is now empty.

Processing remaining hand:

sum(1//2,1//2,1//2,1//2,1//2,1//2) → 0. So total coins 6.

Which matches the sample.

Thus, the code works for this case.

Now, implementing the code in Python.

The code will:

- Read n and k.

- Read the list a.

- Split into initial_hand and deck.

- Build a frequency dictionary using a Counter.

- Process each step in the drawing phase:

   For each i in 0 to (n-k)//2 -1:

      find a type with count >=2.

      if found, increment coins, subtract 2.

      else, subtract 1 from two different types.

      add the next two cards from deck (deck[2*i], deck[2*i+1]).

- After the drawing phase, process the remaining counts.

Now, the code:
