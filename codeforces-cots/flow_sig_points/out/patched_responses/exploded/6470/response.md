Okay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is, given a complete undirected graph with N vertices, we need to find the maximum shortest path between any pair of nodes. Wait, but the graph is complete, so every pair is directly connected. But maybe there's a shorter path through other nodes. So for each pair of nodes (i,j), we need to compute the shortest path distance between them, and then find the maximum among all these distances.

The constraints say N is up to 10, which is very small. So even a O(N^3) algorithm like Floyd-Warshall should work here, right? Because 10^3 is 1000 operations, which is way under the time limit.

So the plan is:

1. Use Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute all-pairs shortest paths.
2. For each pair (i,j), find their shortest path distance.
3. Find the maximum of these distances.

Wait, but the graph is undirected and complete, but the edge weights can vary. For example, in the first sample input:

3 nodes. The edges are:
0-1:1, 0-2:1, 1-2:4. The shortest path from 1 to 2 is either the direct edge (4) or via node 0 (1+1=2), which is shorter. So the answer is 2, which is the maximum of all pairs' shortest paths.

So, using Floyd-Warshall makes sense here. Let's think about how to implement that.

The steps for Floyd-Warshall are:
Initialize a distance matrix, same as the input.
Then for each k from 0 to N-1:
   for each i and j:
      distance[i][j] = min(distance[i][j], distance[i][k] + distance[k][j])

After filling this matrix, we look for the maximum value in the upper triangle (excluding the diagonal) since the matrix is symmetric.

Wait, but since it's undirected, the matrix is symmetric. So for i and j, the distance is same as j and i. So after running Floyd-Warshall, we can just iterate over all i < j pairs and find the maximum among those.

So the steps are:

Read N.
Read N lines, each with N integers, which is the adjacency matrix. Let's call it dist, initialized as the input.

Then for k in 0 to N-1:
   for i in 0 to N-1:
      for j in 0 to N-1:
          dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j])

Once all pairs are computed, find the maximum value in the dist matrix for i != j.

But wait, the problem says to output the maximum of all shortest paths between any pair. So after computing all pairs, we just take the maximum value in the entire matrix (excluding the diagonal where i == j).

Yes.

So the code can be structured as follows:

Read N.

Read N lines, each line as a list of integers. The distance matrix is stored as a 2D array.

Apply Floyd-Warshall.

Compute the maximum value in the matrix where i != j.

Return that maximum.

But what about the time and space? For N=10, the distance matrix is 10x10. Floyd-Warshall runs in O(N^3) = 1000 operations. That's way within the time constraints. Memory-wise, storing a 10x10 matrix is negligible. So this approach is feasible.

Now, implementing this in Python.

The input part: first line is N, then N lines, each line has N numbers. So for example, the first sample input:

3
0 1 1
1 0 4
1 4 0

We read this into a 3x3 matrix.

Then, for each k in 0..2, i in 0..2, j in 0..2, we update dist[i][j] to be the min between current value and dist[i][k] + dist[k][j].

After processing all k, the dist matrix contains the shortest paths.

Then, the maximum is found by checking all i and j where i != j.

Wait, but since it's symmetric, checking i < j would suffice, but checking all pairs is easier.

So in code:

max_dist = 0

for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if i != j:
            if dist[i][j] > max_dist:
                max_dist = dist[i][j]

print(max_dist)

Yes.

Now, code steps:

Read N.

Read N lines, each split into integers.

Initialize the dist matrix.

Then perform Floyd-Warshall.

Then compute the maximum.

Now, for the code.

But in Python, lists are mutable. So the code can be written as:

n = int(input())
dist = []
for _ in range(n):
    row = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dist.append(row)

Then, Floyd-Warshall:

for k in range(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]:
                dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]

Wait, but in Python, this is straightforward.

But in some cases, you need to create a copy, but here, since the updates are done in place, it's okay.

Wait, Floyd-Warshall's standard implementation uses a dynamic programming approach where for each k, the intermediate nodes are allowed to be up to k. So for each k, the distance is updated by considering paths that go through 0..k as intermediates.

So the code as written is correct.

Once that's done, compute the maximum.

So the code is:

max_val = 0
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if i != j:
            if dist[i][j] > max_val:
                max_val = dist[i][j]
print(max_val)

This should handle all cases.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))
    dist = [list(map(int, input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n").split())) for _ in range(n)]

    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]:
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]

    max_distance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j and dist[i][j] > max_distance:
                max_distance = dist[i][j]

    print(max_distance, file=output_stream)



def test():
    import io

    TEST_CASES = [
        {
            "input": \
"""\
4
0 1 2 3
1 0 4 5
2 4 0 6
3 5 6 0
""",
            "output": \
"""\
5
""",
        }, 
    ]

    for i, test_case in enumerate(TEST_CASES):
        in_stream = io.StringIO(test_case["input"])
        expected_output = test_case["output"].rstrip()

        out_stream = io.StringIO()
        main(in_stream, out_stream)
        real_output = out_stream.getvalue().rstrip()

        assert real_output == expected_output, \
            f'Test case {i} failed.\nExpected: {expected_output!r}\nGot: {real_output!r}'

    print('Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    test()


```

<RUN_SNIPPET>
```output
Tests passed ðŸ˜Ž

```

Second sample input:

4
0 1 2 3
1 0 4 5
2 4 0 6
3 5 6 0

After Floyd-Warshall:

The shortest paths between all pairs.

For example, between 1 and 3 (assuming 0-based indices):

Direct edge is 5. But perhaps via node 0: 1's edge to 0 is 1, 0's edge to 3 is 3. Sum is 4, which is better than 5. So the shortest path is 4.

But the sample output is 5. Let's see:

Wait, the sample output is 5. So perhaps the maximum shortest path is 5. Let's see.

Looking at all pairs:

0-1: 1

0-2: 2

0-3:3

1-2: via 0:1+2=3, which is better than direct 4. So shortest is 3.

1-3: via 0:1+3=4, which is better than 5. So 4.

2-3: via 0:2+3=5, but direct is 6. So 5.

So all pairs:

0-1:1

0-2:2

0-3:3

1-0:1

1-2:3

1-3:4

2-0:2

2-1:3

2-3:5

3-0:3

3-1:4

3-2:5

So the maximum is 5 (between 2 and 3 or 3 and 2). So the output is 5, which matches the sample.

So the code would correctly compute this.

Thus, the approach is correct.

        if i != j and dist[i][j] > max_distance:
