<think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is about moving pancakes between dishes to make the array non-increasing with the least number of moves. Hmm. So each move is shifting a pancake from one dish to an adjacent one. We need to find the minimal total moves required.

First, I need to figure out what the target configuration looks like. Because the array has to be non-increasing, each dish must have at least as many as the next one. But there might be multiple possible non-increasing arrays that sum up to m. However, the key here is that the target array has to have the same sum as the original, since we're just moving pancakes. So the problem reduces to finding the optimal non-increasing array (same sum) that can be reached with minimal moves.

Wait, but how do we model this? The minimal moves would depend on how we arrange the pancakes in the target array and how each pancake's movement is calculated.

Let me think. The minimal moves are the sum of the distances each pancake moves from its original position. So for each pancake in the original array, when we move it to a new position in the target array, the distance between original and new position contributes to the total moves. So the problem becomes finding a non-increasing array where the sum of (original position - target position) for all pancakes is minimized. Wait, but each move is moving a pancake one step. So each move of a pancake from position i to j (j can be i-1 or i+1, etc.) would accumulate |i-j| moves for that pancake.

So the total moves required is the sum over all pancakes of the distance they are moved. So the optimal target array is the non-increasing array that minimizes this total distance.

Therefore, the problem can be approached by finding such a target array and computing the sum of the distances each pancake is moved.

But how do we model the target array? Let's think step by step.

The target array must be non-increasing. So, for each position i from 1 to n-1, target[i] >= target[i+1].

Moreover, the sum of the target array must be m, same as the original.

We need to compute for each possible target array (non-increasing and sum m) the minimal movement cost. Then choose the minimal cost.

But enumerating all possible non-increasing arrays is not feasible, especially since m can be up to 250. We need a dynamic programming approach here.

Hmm. Let's think of building the target array from left to right. For each position i, the value can't exceed the previous value. So for each position i, the possible value is up to the previous value. But how to model this efficiently?

An alternative approach is to model the problem as a dynamic programming problem where we track for each position i and possible value v, the minimal cost to assign v to position i, given that the previous positions are non-increasing.

But the possible values for v can be up to m. For n up to 250 and m up to 250, the total possible states would be O(n*m), and for each state, transitions would depend on possible values for the next positions.

Wait, but each position's value must be <= the previous one. So for position i+1, the maximum possible value is the value of position i. So the DP state could be (i, current_max) where current_max is the maximum allowed value for position i. Then, for each position, we can try all possible values up to current_max, and track the remaining pancakes.

But how to model the remaining pancakes? The sum up to position i would be s, and the remaining positions (i+1..n) would have sum (m - s). So the sum up to position i is needed.

So the DP state would need to track the current position, the allowed maximum value for the current position, and the remaining sum of pancakes to allocate.

Wait, but for each position i, the sum allocated so far (sum of a_1 to a_i) is s, and the sum remaining (m - s) must be allocated to the remaining positions (i+1 to n) in a way that each is <= the previous. For example, for the next position i+1, its value can be at most the value of position i, and the sum of the remaining positions must be m - s.

Hmm. So the DP state can be defined as (i, prev_val, remaining_sum), where i is the current position, prev_val is the value of the previous position (so the current position's value can't exceed prev_val), and remaining_sum is the sum that must be allocated from position i to n.

Wait, no. Wait, the sum up to position i-1 is s_prev, then the current position i can have a value up to prev_val (the value of position i-1), and the remaining sum (m - s_prev) must be allocated from i to n. For each position i, the value must be <= prev_val and such that the sum from i to n is (remaining_sum). So for the DP state, perhaps the parameters are position i, the maximum allowed value for i (which is the value of i-1), and the sum that remains to be allocated from i to n.

But even with n up to 250 and m up to 250, the possible states could be manageable. Let's see: for each position i (up to 250), possible prev_val (up to 250), and remaining sum (up to 250). So the total number of states is 250 * 250 * 250 = around 15 million. Which might be a bit high for Python, but maybe manageable with memoization and optimizations.

Alternatively, we can model the DP with two parameters: current position i and the maximum allowed value for this position (which is the value of i-1), and the remaining sum to allocate from i to n. Then, for each state (i, prev_val, rem_sum), we can try all possible values v for position i where v <= prev_val, and v * (n - i + 1) >= rem_sum (since each of the remaining positions must be <= v, but the sum has to be exactly rem_sum). Wait, no. For example, if the remaining sum is rem_sum, and we are at position i, then the sum of positions i to n must be rem_sum. The maximum possible sum is v * (n - i + 1), but if rem_sum is larger than that, then it's impossible. Wait, but the sum must be exactly rem_sum. So for a given v (value of position i), the remaining positions (i+1 to n) must sum to (rem_sum - v). And each of those positions must be <= v.

So when choosing a value v for position i, we need to ensure that the sum rem_sum - v can be split into (n - i) positions, each <= v. The minimal sum for the remaining positions is 0 (if all are 0), but the sum must be exactly rem_sum - v.

So, for the DP, when choosing a value v for position i, we need to have:

sum_{k=i+1 to n} a_k' = rem_sum - v

and for each k from i+1 to n, a_k' <= a_{k-1}'.

But since a_{k-1}' is the value of position k-1 (which is the next in the DP), perhaps we can model this by considering that each next position must be <= v.

Wait, no. Because when we choose v for position i, then position i+1 can be at most v, and position i+2 can be at most position i+1's value, etc. So the minimal sum for the remaining positions is the sum of 0 + 0 + ... + 0 (if all are zero), which is zero. The maximum sum is v + v + ... + v (for (n - i) terms), which is v*(n - i). So rem_sum - v must be between 0 and v*(n - i).

So, the condition for a possible v is:

0 <= rem_sum - v <= v * (n - i)

Which can be rewritten as:

v >= ceil( (rem_sum - v) / (n - i) )

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think: For the remaining positions (i+1 to n) which are (n - i) positions, each can be at most v. So the maximum sum possible for those positions is v*(n - i). The sum required is rem_sum - v. So rem_sum -v must be <= v*(n - i). Also, since each position can be zero or more, rem_sum - v must be >= 0.

So, combining these:

rem_sum -v >=0 → v <= rem_sum.

and

rem_sum -v <= v*(n -i) → rem_sum <= v*(n -i +1 )

So, for a given i, rem_sum, and n, the possible v must satisfy:

v >= ceil( rem_sum / (n -i +1) )

Wait, because:

v*(n -i +1) >= rem_sum → v >= rem_sum/(n -i +1 )

But since v must be an integer, we have v >= ceil( rem_sum / (n -i +1) ).

But also, v can't exceed prev_val (the maximum allowed value from the previous position), and can't exceed rem_sum (since rem_sum -v must be >=0).

So the possible v's for the current position i are in the range [ ceil(rem_sum/(n -i +1)), min(prev_val, rem_sum) ) ]

Wait, but rem_sum is the sum to be allocated from position i to n. So for position i, the maximum possible v is min(prev_val, rem_sum) (since rem_sum is the sum needed, and the remaining positions after i can't contribute if v is larger than rem_sum). Also, the minimal v is ceil( rem_sum / (n -i +1) ), because if each of the positions i to n can be at most v, then the minimal v is the ceiling of the average, because if you have sum S and k positions, the minimal maximum is ceil(S/k). Wait, yes. For example, if S=5 and k=2, you can have 3 and 2, so the maximum is 3. So yes, the minimal possible v (the maximum possible value for position i) is ceil(S/(k)), where S is the sum and k is the number of positions. But in our case, the positions after i can have values up to v (since they have to be non-increasing). So the sum of the remaining positions (i+1 to n) must be S = rem_sum -v. And for those (n-i) positions, each can be up to v, but their sum is S. So the minimal possible value of v is ceil( (rem_sum) / (n -i + 1) ). Because the sum of (n-i+1) elements (position i and i+1 to n) is rem_sum, and each can be at most v. So the minimal v that allows this is ceil(rem_sum/(n-i+1)).

So for each position i, the possible v is in [ceil(rem_sum/(n-i+1)), min(prev_val, rem_sum)].

If this interval is invalid (i.e., min(prev_val, rem_sum) < ceil(...)), then this v is not possible, and we can skip it.

But how to model this in DP.

So the DP approach would be:

Define dp[i][prev_val][rem_sum] as the minimal cost to assign values to positions 1..i, with the i-th position having value <= prev_val, and the remaining sum (from i to n) being rem_sum.

Wait, no. Maybe the DP state should be:

We are processing the i-th position. The previous position (i-1) has a value of prev_val. The sum that needs to be allocated from i to n is rem_sum. We need to choose a value v for position i such that v <= prev_val and the sum from i to n is rem_sum. Then, the sum from i+1 to n must be rem_sum - v.

But the sum from i+1 to n is (rem_sum - v), and each of those positions must form a non-increasing sequence. So for each possible v for position i (<= prev_val), we need to check if (rem_sum - v) can be split into (n -i) positions, each <= v. Which requires that rem_sum -v <= v*(n -i). Also, rem_sum >= v.

Wait, so for a given v, the conditions are:

1. v <= prev_val
2. v <= rem_sum (since rem_sum -v >=0)
3. (rem_sum -v) <= v*(n -i) → rem_sum <= v*(n -i +1)
   → which is equivalent to v >= rem_sum/(n -i +1)
   So v >= ceil( rem_sum / (n -i +1) )

So combining these:

v must be in [lower, upper], where:

lower = max( ceil(rem_sum/(n -i +1)), 0 )

upper = min( prev_val, rem_sum )

But how to compute ceil( rem_sum/(n -i +1) )? For example, if rem_sum is 5 and (n-i+1) is 2, then ceil(5/2) is 3. So yes, the minimal v is 3.

So for each possible v in this range, we can proceed to the next state (i+1, v, rem_sum - v), and calculate the cost for choosing this v.

But how to compute the cost? The cost for the current position i's value v would be the sum of the movement costs from the original a array to the target array. Wait, but the original array is given. So for each position i in the target array, the number of pancakes assigned is v. But the original a_i might have some pancakes. So the movement cost is the sum over all pancakes' movement distances. But how do we track that?

Alternatively, the movement cost is the sum of |original position of each pancake - target position|. But since each pancake can be moved in any way as long as the target array is achieved, the minimal total moves is the sum of all |x_i - y_i| for each pancake, where x_i is the original position of the pancake, and y_i is the target position. But since pancakes are indistinct (only the counts matter), the total moves can be computed as the sum for each position j of the number of pancakes in j (original) multiplied by the absolute difference between j and their new position. But how to model this.

Wait, perhaps the total movement cost can be precomputed based on the target array. For each position in the target array, the number of pancakes there is v. The movement cost for that position is the sum of the distances each pancake in the original array moved to reach this position.

But for that, we can model the problem as follows:

For each possible target array a', which is non-increasing, the cost is the sum over all positions i of the sum of distances for the a'_i pancakes that are in i in the target array. But since pancakes are indistinct, the minimal cost is achieved by assigning the closest possible original pancakes to each target position.

Wait, this is similar to the problem of finding the minimal total distance to move elements into certain positions. For example, the problem where you have elements and you want to group them into certain positions with minimal moves. The optimal arrangement is to have the elements in their respective target positions, sorted. But perhaps here, the target array's structure (non-increasing) complicates things.

But perhaps we can model the movement cost as follows:

For each target array a', the cost is the sum over each position i of the number of pancakes in a'_i multiplied by the difference between i and the original positions of those pancakes. However, since we don't track individual pancakes, we need a way to compute this efficiently.

Alternatively, the movement cost can be computed using prefix sums and other cumulative data structures. Let's think.

Suppose we have a target array a'. The total movement cost is the sum for each target position j of the sum over all pancakes in a'_j of |original position of the pancake - j|. But since the original array has a_i pancakes in position i, we can model this as follows:

We can precompute for each position j (target), the cumulative movement cost if we move all pancakes from the original array to their new positions in j.

But this is not straightforward. Alternatively, for the target array a', the movement cost is the sum for each i (original position) of a_i multiplied by the sum of the distances between i and the positions of the a_i pancakes in the target array. But again, since the target array's structure is non-increasing, this is difficult.

But perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's model the problem in terms of the target array. Let's say the target array is a', which is non-increasing. We need to assign each of the m pancakes to a position in the target array. The movement cost is the sum of |original position (o) - new position (n)| for each pancake.

The minimal total movement is achieved when the pancakes in the original array's positions are moved to the new positions in a way that for each new position, the original positions of the pancakes assigned to it are as close as possible.

But since the pancakes are indistinct, the optimal assignment is to assign the closest possible original positions to each target position. But how do we model this?

An alternative approach is to note that the total movement cost can be computed as the sum over all positions i in the original array of the sum of the distances from i to the new positions where those a_i pancakes are moved. For example, if in the original array, position i has x pancakes, and in the target array, those x pancakes are distributed across various positions j, then the total movement cost is sum over j (count_j_i * |i - j| ), where count_j_i is the number of pancakes moved from original position i to new position j. The sum of count_j_i for all j must equal a_i.

But this seems computationally expensive, but perhaps we can find a way to precompute this.

Wait, but for a given target array a', the optimal way to assign the original pancakes to the target positions is to greedily assign the original pancakes from the left to the target positions in a way that minimizes the sum. But how?

Alternatively, the minimal movement cost is the same as the Earth Mover's Distance between the original array and the target array. The Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) is the minimal cost to move the mass (pancakes) from the source (original) distribution to the target distribution. The EMD can be computed using dynamic programming in this case.

But how to compute the EMD between the two arrays. Let's think.

The original array is a vector a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, and the target is a'_1, a'_2, ..., a'_n. We need to find the minimal sum of |i-j| * f_ij, where f_ij is the number of pancakes moved from i to j, subject to sum_j f_ij = a_i, sum_i f_ij = a'_j, and sum_ij f_ij = m.

The minimal EMD for 1D arrays can be computed using a greedy approach. For example, we can process the arrays from left to right, keeping track of the surplus or deficit of pancakes. For each position, the movement needed is the cumulative sum of the surplus/deficit multiplied by the distance.

This is similar to the problem of finding the minimal number of moves to equalize the array, but here it's between two arbitrary distributions. The minimal cost is the sum of the absolute differences of the prefix sums, as per the EMD in 1D.

Yes! The minimal EMD between two distributions a and a' is the sum over i of |F_i - F'_i|, where F_i is the prefix sum of a up to i, and F'_i is the prefix sum of a' up to i. Because moving a pancake from i to j (j>i) requires passing through all positions in between. The cumulative effect is captured by the difference in the prefix sums.

Wait, I remember that for the Earth Mover's Distance in 1D, the minimal cost is indeed the sum of the absolute differences between the prefix sums of the two arrays. For example, in the problem where you have a histogram and you want to compute the minimal cost to transform one into another, the answer is the sum of |F_i - F'_i| where F is the prefix sum.

So, if we have the original array's prefix sums S and the target array's prefix sums T, then the minimal movement cost is sum_{i=1 to n} |S_i - T_i|.

Yes! Because each unit of difference in the prefix sum at position i implies that there is a pancake that has to cross the i-th position, contributing 1 to the cost for each such crossing.

So, the minimal movement cost is the sum of absolute differences between the prefix sums of the original and target arrays.

This is a crucial insight. So, given the target array a', the movement cost is sum_{i=1 to n} |S_i - T_i|, where S_i is the prefix sum of the original array up to i, and T_i is the prefix sum of the target array up to i.

So, the problem reduces to finding a non-increasing array a' (sum m) that minimizes the sum of absolute differences between the original and target prefix sums.

This is a big simplification. Now, the problem is to find a non-increasing array a' such that sum(a') = m, and the sum of |S_i - T_i| is minimized, where S is the prefix sum of the original array and T is the prefix sum of a'.

So, the DP approach can now be modified to track the prefix sum T_i of the target array up to position i. For each position i, we need to choose T_i such that T_i >= T_{i+1} (since a' is non-increasing), and sum(T_n) = m.

Wait, no. Wait, T_i is the prefix sum up to position i. So T_1 = a'_1, T_2 = a'_1 + a'_2, ..., T_n = m. The a' array is non-increasing, so each a'_i >= a'_{i+1}, which implies that T_i - T_{i-1} >= T_{i+1} - T_i → rearranged as T_i >= (T_{i+1} + T_{i-1}) ) / 2. But perhaps this is not the easiest way to model it.

Alternatively, since a' is non-increasing, the differences between consecutive T's are non-increasing. Because T_i = T_{i-1} + a'_i. So, since a'_i >= a'_{i+1}, then T_i - T_{i-1} >= T_{i+1} - T_i. So T_i - T_{i-1} is non-increasing.

But perhaps this is not the way to model it. Let's think again. The target a' array is non-increasing, so a'_1 >= a'_2 >= ... >= a'_n. Therefore, the increments in the prefix sum T must be non-increasing: T_i - T_{i-1} >= T_{i+1} - T_i for all i from 1 to n-1. So the increments (the a'_i's) must form a non-increasing sequence.

But in terms of the prefix sums T, the sequence must satisfy T_1 >= T_2 - T_1 >= T_3 - T_2 >= ... >= T_n - T_{n-1}.

So, for each position i, the difference between T_i and T_{i-1} must be >= the difference between T_{i+1} and T_i.

But how to model this in a DP.

The idea is to build the prefix sums T_i for the target array, ensuring that the increments are non-increasing. Then, for each i, the minimal sum of |S_i - T_i| is computed.

The DP state can be defined as (i, last_increment), where i is the current position, and last_increment is the increment from T_{i-1} to T_i. Then, for the next position i+1, the increment (T_{i+1} - T_i) must be <= last_increment.

Additionally, since T_n must equal m, the sum of all increments (a'_1 + ... + a'_n) must be m. So the DP must track the current sum and the last_increment.

But considering that the sum up to position i is T_i, and the remaining sum is m - T_i, which must be distributed over (n -i) positions with each increment <= last_increment.

So the DP state can be (i, T_i, last_increment). Then, for each state, we can choose the next increment (a'_{i+1}) to be <= last_increment, and such that the sum of all remaining increments (a'_{i+1} + ... + a'_n) = m - T_i. And each subsequent increment must be <= the previous one.

But the problem is that this could lead to a very large number of states. For example, T_i can be up to m (250), last_increment can be up to m. So for each i (up to 250), T_i (up to 250), last_increment (up to 250), the number of states is 250*250*250 = 15 million. But multiplied by 250 positions, it's 3.75e9, which is way too big.

Hmm. So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative idea: since the increments are non-increasing, the minimal possible last_increment for the next step is 0, and the maximum is the previous last_increment. So for each step, the possible next increment is between 0 and the current last_increment. But how to model the remaining sum and the number of positions left.

Wait, for the next position, i+1, the increment (a'_{i+1}) must be <= last_increment. Also, the sum of all remaining increments (from i+1 to n) must be m - T_i. Let's say that we have k positions left (n - i). Then, the sum of the next increment (x) and all subsequent increments must be (m-T_i), and each subsequent increment must be <=x and so on.

The minimal possible x is ceil( (m-T_i) /k ), because x is the first increment (for i+1) and must be >= the average of the remaining sum. Because the remaining k positions can have at most x each. So sum_{j=1 to k} x_j <= k *x. But the sum must be exactly (m-T_i). So x >= (m-T_i)/k. Since x must be an integer, x >= ceil( (m-T_i)/k ). Also, x can't exceed the previous last_increment.

So for each state (i, T_i, last_increment), the possible x for the next increment is in [ceil( (m-T_i)/(k) ), min(last_increment, m-T_i) )], where k = n -i.

If this interval is invalid (ceil(...) > min(...)), then this state is invalid and can be skipped.

So the DP transitions can be defined as follows:

For each state (i, T_i, last_incr):

   remaining_sum = m - T_i

   k = n - i

   if k == 0:

      if remaining_sum ==0, then the cost is sum of |S_i - T_i| so far.

      else, invalid.

   else:

      min_x = ceil( remaining_sum / k )

      max_x = min( last_incr, remaining_sum )

      if min_x > max_x: invalid.

      for x in min_x to max_x:

          next_T_i = T_i + x

          next_remaining_sum = remaining_sum -x

          next_k = k-1 = n - (i+1)

          the next state is (i+1, next_T_i, x)

          the cost added is | S_{i+1} - next_T_i | (since the prefix sum up to i+1 is next_T_i)

          then, we can proceed to the next step.

The base case is the first position (i=0, T_0=0, last_incr=infinity). Because for i=0, the next increment (i=1) can be any value x, as long as the remaining sum (m -x) can be split into (n-1) increments, each <=x. So for the first position, last_incr is effectively unbounded (since there's no previous increment), so the possible x is between ceil(m/n) and m.

But this seems manageable.

So the DP state is (i, T_i, last_incr), and for each state, we track the minimal cost (sum of absolute differences of prefix sums up to i).

The goal is to compute the minimal cost for state (n, m, x) (any x), but since the last_incr can be any value <= previous, but after n positions, the sum must be m.

So the initial state is (i=0, T_i=0, last_incr=infinity), and the cost is 0.

But how to handle the last_incr for the first step.

Alternatively, for the first step (i=1), the last_incr is x, which can be any value >= ceil(m/n) (since after that, the remaining sum m -x must be split into n-1 positions, each <=x). So x must be >= ceil( (m) / n ). Also, x can't exceed m.

So the possible x for the first step is [ceil(m/n), m], and then for each x, the remaining sum is m -x, which must be split into n-1 positions, each <=x.

So for the first step, the state is (i=1, T_i =x, last_incr=x), and the cost is |S_1 -x|.

Then, for each subsequent step, the transitions are as before.

But how to model this in code. Because the DP has a lot of states, but with memoization and pruning, it might be feasible.

In Python, for n and m up to 250, the number of possible states is 250 (i) * 250 (T_i) * 250 (last_incr) = 15,625,000. Which is manageable, but in practice, many of these states may not be reachable or may have overlapping transitions.

So the plan is:

1. Precompute the original prefix sums S.

2. Use a dynamic programming approach where the state is (i, T_i, last_incr), tracking the minimal cost to reach that state.

3. For each state, iterate over possible next increments x (in the allowed range), compute the next state (i+1, T_i +x, x), and update the cost with the absolute difference between S[i+1] and T_i +x.

4. The answer is the minimal cost among all states where i ==n and T_i ==m.

But in code, how to represent the DP table.

We can use a dictionary or a 3D array. However, given that i can be up to 250, T_i up to 250, and last_incr up to 250, a 3D array of size 250 * 251 * 251 (since T_i can be up to m=250, but T_i can also be up to m) would be manageable.

Wait, for i=0 to n, T_i can be up to m. For i=1, T_i is x, which can be up to m. For i=2, T_i is x + x2, etc. So yes, T_i can go up to m.

So, the DP can be represented as a 3D array: dp[i][t][l] = minimal cost to reach position i with total sum t and last increment l.

But in Python, even a 3D list of size 250*250*250 is 15,625,000 elements. Which is manageable if we use integers and fill them efficiently.

But perhaps we can optimize space by using a dictionary to track only the possible states for each i.

Alternatively, for each step i, we can track a dictionary of (T_i, last_incr) to the minimal cost. Then, for each possible (t, l) in the current step, we generate the possible next (t +x, x) for x in the allowed range, and update the next step's dictionary.

This approach would use less memory, as for each i, only the possible (t, l) pairs are stored.

So the code can be structured as follows:

- Precompute the prefix sums S of the original array.

- Initialize a dictionary (dp) for i=0 with state (t=0, last_incr=infinity) and cost 0.

Wait, but how to handle the first step. For i=1, the first increment is x, which must be >= ceil(m/n) and <=m.

But for the first step, the state is (i=1, t=x, last_incr=x), and the cost is |S[1] -x|.

Then, for each i from 1 to n-1:

   for each state (t, l) in dp[i], for each possible x in [ceil( (m-t) / (n-i) ), min(l, m-t) ) ]:

       new_t = t +x

       new_l = x

       new_cost = current_cost + |S[i+1] - new_t|

       update dp[i+1][new_t][new_l] to be the minimum between existing value and new_cost.

Finally, after processing all i up to n, the answer is the minimal cost in dp[n] where t is m.

But how to handle the initial step.

Wait, for i=0, T_0 is 0. Then, for the first position (i=1), the increment x is a'_1. The sum after i=1 is x. Then, the remaining sum is m -x, which needs to be split into (n-1) positions, each <=x. So x must be >= ceil( (m -x) / (n-1) ). But this seems complicated. Alternatively, for the first step (i=1), x can range between ceil(m /n ) and m, since (m-x) must be >=0, and x must be >= ceil( (m -x) / (n-1) ), but this depends on x. But perhaps the minimal x is ceil(m/n), and the maximum x is m. For example, if m=6 and n=3, then x can be from 2 (ceil(6/3)=2) to 6. But for x=6, the remaining sum is 0, which is okay.

But how to compute the possible x for the first step.

Wait, for i=1:

k = n -1

remaining_sum = m -x

So x must satisfy:

remaining_sum >=0 → x <=m

and:

remaining_sum <=x *k → x >= remaining_sum /k → x >= (m -x)/k → x*k >= m -x → x (k +1) >=m → x >= ceil( m/(k+1) )

since k =n-1 (for i=1, k= n-1), then x >= ceil(m/(n)).

But how to compute x for the first step.

So for the first step (i=1), possible x is between ceil(m/n) and m.

So the initial state (i=0) is (t=0, last_incr= infinity). Then, for x in the first step, possible x is >= ceil(m/n) and <=m. But since the previous last_incr is infinity (or any large value), x can be any of these values.

So, in code, for the first step, the code would generate x from ceil(m/n) to m, and for each x, check if x >= (m -x)/(n-1), which is:

x >= (m -x)/(n-1)

But since x >= ceil(m/n), and (m -x) <=m - ceil(m/n) → (m -x)/(n-1) could be <=x.

But perhaps for the first step, it's sufficient to iterate x from ceil(m/n) to min(m, ... )

Alternatively, the code can proceed to generate all possible x in the first step, and for each, check if the remaining sum (m-x) can be split into (n-1) positions with increments <=x.

But even if it can't, the code would skip those x during the next steps.

But perhaps it's better to generate all possible x for the first step, and let the subsequent steps handle the pruning.

So, in code, the steps are:

Read n, m.

Read a array.

Compute the prefix sums S of the original array. S[0] =0, S[1] =a[0], S[2] =a[0]+a[1], etc. Wait, the problem says the input is a_1 to a_n. So in code, the a array is zero-based or one-based?

In Python, we'll read the input as a list. Let's assume it's zero-based. So S[0] =0, S[1] =a[0], S[2] =a[0]+a[1], etc.

Then, the DP starts with i=0, t=0, last_incr=infinity (or a large number like m+1), and cost=0.

But since in Python, we can represent last_incr as a variable. However, for the first step, the last_incr is x, so for i=1, last_incr can be any x >= ceil(m/n).

So the code can proceed as follows:

Initialize the DP as a list of dictionaries, where for each step i, we have a dictionary that maps (t, l) to the minimal cost.

But how to represent this. For each i, we can have a dictionary where the keys are tuples (t, l), and the value is the minimal cost.

So code outline:

n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
prefix = [0] * (n+1)
for i in range(1, n+1):
    prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + a[i-1]

# Initialize DP
from collections import defaultdict
dp = [defaultdict(dict) for _ in range(n+2)]  # dp[i] is for step i

# Initial state: i=0, t=0, last_incr is a large value (unrestricted)
dp[0][(0, float('inf'))] = 0

for i in range(n):
    current_states = dp[i]
    for (t, last_incr), cost in current_states.items():
        if i == 0:
            # First step: i=0 → i+1=1
            # Possible x is from ceil(m/n) to m
            k = n -1  # remaining positions after i=1
            if k <0:
                # n=1, then x must be m
                x = m
                new_t = t +x
                new_last_incr = x
                new_cost = cost + abs(prefix[1] - new_t)
                if new_t == m and i+1 ==n:
                    # update the final answer
                    dp[i+1][(new_t, new_last_incr)] = min(dp[i+1].get((new_t, new_last_incr), float('inf')), new_cost)
                else:
                    # proceed
                    key = (new_t, new_last_incr)
                    if key not in dp[i+1] or new_cost < dp[i+1][key]:
                        dp[i+1][key] = new_cost
                continue
            min_x = (m + n -1) // (k +1)  # ceil(m/(k+1)) = ceil(m/n)
            max_x = m
            for x in range(min_x, max_x+1):
                remaining_sum = m -x
                # Check if remaining_sum can be split into k steps, each <=x
                # since the next increments must be <=x, and sum must be remaining_sum
                # The minimal sum for the remaining steps is 0 (if all x_2 ... x_n =0)
                # So as long as remaining_sum >=0 and remaining_sum <=x *k, which:
                if remaining_sum <0:
                    continue
                if remaining_sum > x *k:

                new_last_incr =x
                new_cost = cost + abs(prefix[1] - new_t)
                # Add to dp[1]
                key = (new_t, new_last_incr)
                if key not in dp[i+1] or new_cost < dp[i+1].get(key, float('inf')):
                    dp[i+1][key] = new_cost
        else:
            # i >=1
            remaining_sum = m -t
            k = n -i
            if k ==0:
                # must have remaining_sum ==0
                if remaining_sum ==0 and i ==n:
                    # add to the final state
                    key = (t, last_incr)
                    dp[i+1][key] = min(dp[i+1].get(key, float('inf')), cost)
                continue
            min_x = (remaining_sum + k -1) // k  # ceil(remaining_sum /k)
            max_x = min(last_incr, remaining_sum)
            if min_x > max_x:
                continue
            for x in range(min_x, max_x+1):
                new_t = t +x
                new_last_incr =x
                new_cost = cost + abs(prefix[i+1] - new_t)
                key = (new_t, new_last_incr)
                if key not in dp[i+1] or new_cost < dp[i+1].get(key, float('inf')):
                    dp[i+1][key] = new_cost

# After processing all steps, the answer is the minimal cost in dp[n] where t ==m
minimal_cost = float('inf')
for (t, l), cost in dp[n].items():
    if t ==m:
        minimal_cost = min(minimal_cost, cost)

print(minimal_cost)

Wait, but in the code, for the first step (i=0), when n=1, then after x is chosen (must be m), and then there are no more steps. So the code needs to handle that.

But when n=1, the code for i=0 (the first step) will set i+1=1, which is n. So the state is (x, x) with x=m, and cost is |S[1] -x|. Since x must be m, S[1] is the original a[0], which sums to m. So the cost is |m - m|=0.

So the code should handle that.

Testing this code against the examples:

Let's take example 3:

Input:
3 6
2 1 3

Output: 1.

The original array is [2,1,3]. The sum is 6.

The target array must be non-increasing. The optimal target is [3,2,1], which sum is 6. The movement cost is computed as the sum of prefix differences.

Original prefix sums S are [0, 2, 3, 6].

Target prefix sums T are [0,3,5,6]. The differences are |0-0| + |2-3| + |3-5| + |6-6| =0 +1 +2 +0 =3. But according to the example, the correct output is 1.

Wait, this suggests a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, the minimal movement cost is 1. How?

In the example, the input is [2,1,3], which is not non-increasing. The optimal target array is [2,3,1]? No, that's not non-increasing. Wait, perhaps the correct target is [3,2,1], but how?

Wait, in the sample input 3:

Input:
3 6
2 1 3 → sum is 6.

The output is 1. The explanation says that after moving one pancake from position 3 to 2, the array becomes [2,1+1,3-1] = [2,2,2], which is non-increasing. Wait, no. 2,2,2 is non-increasing. But the minimal moves is 1.

But according to the code, the target array is [2,2,2], which is non-increasing. The prefix sums are 2,4,6.

Original prefix sums are 0, 2, 3, 6.

The sum of absolute differences between prefix sums:

|0-0| =0

|2-2|=0

|3-4|=1

|6-6|=0 → total cost 1. Which matches the sample output.

Ah! So the code's approach is correct.

So, in the code, the target array's prefix sums are tracked, and the sum of absolute differences between the original prefix sums and the target prefix sums gives the minimal movement cost.

Thus, the code should work.

Another example: the first sample input:

6 19

5 3 2 3 3 3 → sum 5+3+2+3+3+3=19.

The target array is [4,3,3,3,3,3]. The prefix sums for the target are:

0,4,7,10,13,16,19.

Original prefix sums are:

0,5,8,10,13,16,19.

The differences are 0 (0-0), 1 (5-4), 1 (8-7), 0 (10-10), 0 (13-13), 0 (16-16), 0 (19-19). Sum is 1+1=2, which matches the sample.

So the code's approach is correct.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, the code in Python:

But in the code, the way the initial step is handled for i=0.

Wait, in the code outline, for i=0:

current_states = dp[0].items()

But for i=0, the code checks if i==0 and handles the first step (i+1=1) by generating possible x values.

But in Python, the initial state is stored in dp[0][(0, inf)] =0.

Then, for each i in 0 to n-1:

So for i=0, the code generates x values for the first step (i+1=1).

But for the case where n=1:

Then, the code for i=0 will have k =n-1=0. So:

if k <0: (but k is 0 → no)

Else:

min_x = (m + (k)) // (k+1) → since k= n-1=0, so (m +0) //1 = m.

max_x =m.

So x ranges from m to m, so x =m. Then, remaining_sum = m -x =0. So proceed.

new_t =x =m.

new_last_incr =x.

new_cost = cost (0) + |S[1] -x|. S[1] is a[0], which for n=1, sum is m. So new_cost is 0.

Thus, the state is added to dp[1], and when i=1 ==n, the code checks if t==m. So it's correct.

Thus, the code should handle all cases.

The code is as follows:

```python
n, m = map(int, input().split())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))

prefix = [0] * (n + 1)
