<think>
Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the maximum possible intersection length after removing exactly one segment from the given n segments. Let's think about how to approach this.

The problem says that the intersection of the remaining n-1 segments should be as long as possible. The key here is to figure out, for each segment, what the intersection would be if we remove that segment, and then find the maximum among all those possibilities.

But how do I compute that efficiently? Because if I naively check each segment's removal by recalculating the intersection of all others, that would be O(n^2) time, which is definitely not feasible for n up to 3e5.

Hmm. Let's think about what the intersection of all segments except the i-th one would be. The intersection of a set of segments is determined by the maximum left endpoint and the minimum right endpoint of all those segments. So, for the remaining segments after removing the i-th, the left would be the maximum of all lefts except the i-th's left, and the right would be the minimum of all rights except the i-th's right. Then the intersection length is max(0, right_new - left_new).

So the challenge is, for each i, quickly find the maximum left except l_i, and the minimum right except r_i.

Wait, but how? Because if we have all the lefts, the maximum left when excluding the i-th is the maximum of the entire array of lefts except the i-th. Similarly for the minimum right.

So, to compute this efficiently, we need to precompute for each i the maximum left when excluding l_i, and the minimum right when excluding r_i.

But how can we do that in O(n) time? Well, for that, we can precompute prefix and suffix maximums for the lefts, and similarly prefix and suffix minimums for the rights.

For example, for the lefts:

We can create two arrays:
- prefix_max_left, where prefix_max_left[i] is the maximum of l_0 to l_i.
- suffix_max_left, where suffix_max_left[i] is the maximum of l_i to l_{n-1}.

Then, for the maximum left when excluding the j-th segment, it's the maximum between prefix_max_left[j-1] (if j>0) and suffix_max_left[j+1] (if j < n-1). So for each j, the max left excluding j is the maximum of the prefix up to j-1 and the suffix starting from j+1.

Similarly, for the rights, we compute prefix_min_right and suffix_min_right. For each j, the min right excluding j is the minimum between the prefix up to j-1 and the suffix starting from j+1.

Wait, but the prefix_max_left for the lefts would need to be the maximum from all segments except j. So for example, when j is removed, the max left is the maximum of all l's except l_j. So yes, by precomputing prefix and suffix arrays, we can get that.

So the steps would be:

1. Precompute prefix_max_left and suffix_max_left for all positions.
2. Precompute prefix_min_right and suffix_min_right for all positions.
3. For each segment j, compute:
   a. current_max_left = the max of all lefts except l_j. This can be found by taking the maximum between prefix_max_left[j-1] (if exists) and suffix_max_left[j+1] (if exists).
   b. current_min_right = the min of all rights except r_j. Similarly, min between prefix_min_right[j-1] and suffix_min_right[j+1].
   c. The intersection length is max(0, current_min_right - current_max_left).
4. The answer is the maximum of all such lengths computed in step 3.

This approach would be O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 3e5.

Let me test this logic against the examples.

Take the first example:

4
1 3
2 6
0 4
3 3

Segments:
0: l=1, r=3
1: l=2, r=6
2: l=0, r=4
3: l=3, r=3

The lefts array is [1,2,0,3]
The rights array is [3,6,4,3]

Compute prefix_max_left:

prefix_max_left[0] =1
prefix_max_left[1] = max(1,2)=2
prefix_max_left[2] = max(2,0)=2
prefix_max_left[3] = max(2,3)=3

suffix_max_left[3]=3
suffix_max_left[2] = max(0,3)=3
suffix_max_left[1] = max(2,3)=3
suffix_max_left[0] = max(1,3)=3

For each j from 0 to 3:

j=0:
current_max_left = max of lefts except 1. So segments 1,2,3: lefts are 2,0,3. Max is 3.
current_min_right = min of rights except 3. Rights are 6,4,3. Min is 3.
So intersection is 3-3=0. But wait, the example says when removing the third segment (j=3?), wait the indices might be different.

Wait in the first example, when j=3 is removed (the segment [3,3]), the remaining segments are 0,1,2. Their lefts are 1,2,0 → max is 2. Their rights are 3,6,4 → min is 3. So intersection is [2,3], length 1. So according to the code:

For j=3 (the fourth segment, index 3 in 0-based), when we remove it, the max left is the max of lefts except l[3] (3). The lefts are 1,2,0. Max is 2. So the code's approach:

prefix_max_left up to j-1 (j=3, j-1=2). prefix_max_left[2] is 2. suffix_max_left[j+1] (j+1=4, which is beyond the array). So current_max_left is 2.

For the rights, current_min_right is the min of rights except r[3] (3). The rights are 3,6,4. Min is 3. So 3-2=1. Which is correct. So the code would compute that.

So how does the code compute current_max_left for j=3?

prefix_max_left[j-1] = prefix_max_left[2] =2. There is no suffix part here. So yes, current_max_left is 2.

Similarly for the other cases. So the approach seems to work.

Another example: the fourth input:

2
3 10
1 5

So segments are [3,10] and [1,5]. Removing the first segment (j=0), the remaining is [1,5]. Its max left is 1, min right is5. So intersection length 4. Removing the second (j=1), remaining is [3,10]. Length 7. So the answer is 7.

In code:

lefts = [3,1]
rights = [10,5]

prefix_max_left for lefts: [3,3]

suffix_max_left: [3,1] (when i=0, suffix starts at 0, which is 3. For i=1, it's 1.)

prefix_min_right for rights: [10,5] (prefix min is 10, then min(10,5) is5)
suffix_min_right: [5,5] (for i=0, the suffix is 10 and5, min is5. For i=1, min is5.)

For j=0: current_max_left is the max of lefts except j=0. So lefts[1] is1. So current_max_left is1. current_min_right is min of rights except 10 (rights[1] is5). So 5. 5-1=4.

For j=1: current_max_left is the max of lefts except 1 (lefts[0] is3). current_min_right is min of rights except5 (rights[0] is10). So 10. 10-3=7. Which is correct.

So the code would correctly compute that.

Thus, the approach seems solid.

Now, the code steps:

First, read n, then read n lines of l and r.

Then, compute prefix_max_left: an array where prefix_max_left[i] is the maximum of l[0..i].

Similarly, compute suffix_max_left[i] as the maximum of l[i..n-1].

Same for prefix_min_right (min of r[0..i]) and suffix_min_right (min of r[i..n-1}).

Once these arrays are computed, iterate over each segment. For each j, compute:

max_left = max of prefix_max_left[j-1] (if j>0) and suffix_max_left[j+1] (if j <n-1). If j is 0, then max_left is suffix_max_left[1]. If j is n-1, then max_left is prefix_max_left[n-2]. For j in the middle, it's the max of prefix_max_left[j-1] and suffix_max_left[j+1].

Similarly, min_right is the min of prefix_min_right[j-1] (if j>0) and suffix_min_right[j+1] (if j <n-1).

Wait, no. Wait the prefix_min_right is computed as the min from 0 to i. So for the j-th element being removed, the min of all rights except r[j] is the minimum of the first j-1 elements and the elements from j+1 to n-1.

But how to compute that? For example, the min of all rights except j would be the min between the prefix up to j-1 and the suffix starting from j+1.

But the prefix_min_right and suffix_min_right arrays can help here.

Wait, let's think of prefix_min_right as the array where prefix_min_right[i] is the minimum of r[0] to r[i].

Similarly, suffix_min_right[i] is the minimum of r[i] to r[n-1].

So, if we want to exclude j, then the min of all rights except j would be the min between the prefix_min_right up to j-1 and the suffix_min_right starting at j+1. Wait, but that's not exactly right. Because the prefix up to j-1 is the min of r[0..j-1], and the suffix starting at j+1 is the min of r[j+1..n-1]. So the min of these two is the overall min except r[j].

Yes. Because the entire array except j is the elements from 0 to j-1 and j+1 to n-1. The min of those two parts is the overall min.

Similarly for the max left.

So for each j:

current_max_left = max( prefix_max_left[j-1] if j>0 else -infinity, suffix_max_left[j+1] if j <n-1 else -infinity )

But in code, how to handle j=0 or j=n-1?

Alternatively, compute for each j:

left_part_max = prefix_max_left[j-1] if j>0 else -infinity

right_part_max = suffix_max_left[j+1] if j <n-1 else -infinity

current_max_left = max(left_part_max, right_part_max)

Similarly for current_min_right:

left_part_min = prefix_min_right[j-1] if j>0 else +infinity

right_part_min = suffix_min_right[j+1] if j <n-1 else +infinity

current_min_right = min(left_part_min, right_part_min)

Wait, but in the case where j is 0, the left_part_min is not present (j-1 is -1). So the left_part_min would be infinity (since there are no elements in the left part). Then, the min between left_part_min (infinity) and right_part_min (which is suffix_min_right[1], which is the min from j+1 to end). So for j=0, the current_min_right is min(infinity, suffix_min_right[1]) → suffix_min_right[1].

Similarly for j=n-1, current_max_left is prefix_max_left[n-2].

So the code would need to handle these edge cases.

Now, how to compute the prefix and suffix arrays.

For prefix_max_left:

Initialize prefix_max_left as a list of size n.

prefix_max_left[0] = l[0]

for i in 1 to n-1:

prefix_max_left[i] = max(prefix_max_left[i-1], l[i])

Similarly for suffix_max_left:

suffix_max_left[n-1] = l[n-1]

for i in n-2 downto 0:

suffix_max_left[i] = max(l[i], suffix_max_left[i+1])

For prefix_min_right:

prefix_min_right[0] = r[0]

for i from 1 to n-1:

prefix_min_right[i] = min(prefix_min_right[i-1], r[i])

For suffix_min_right:

suffix_min_right[n-1] = r[n-1]

for i from n-2 downto 0:

suffix_min_right[i] = min(r[i], suffix_min_right[i+1])

Once all these arrays are built, for each j, compute current_max_left and current_min_right as discussed.

Then calculate the length as max(0, current_min_right - current_max_left).

The maximum of all such lengths is the answer.

Now, for handling the cases where j is the first or last element:

For example, j=0:

current_max_left is the max of all l except l[0], which is suffix_max_left[1] (since j+1 is 1). So if j=0, left_part_max is prefix_max_left[-1], which is undefined. So in code, when j=0, left_part_max is set to a very low value (like -infinity) so that the max between left_part_max and right_part_max is right_part_max.

Similarly for j=n-1, right_part_max is set to -infinity, so current_max_left is left_part_max (prefix_max_left[j-1]).

Same logic applies for min_right.

In code:

So in Python, for each j in 0..n-1:

if j ==0:

left_part_max = -infinity

else:

left_part_max = prefix_max_left[j-1]

if j ==n-1:

right_part_max = -infinity

else:

right_part_max = suffix_max_left[j+1]

current_max_left = max(left_part_max, right_part_max)

Similarly for the min_right:

if j==0:

left_part_min = infinity

else:

left_part_min = prefix_min_right[j-1]

if j ==n-1:

right_part_min = infinity

else:

right_part_min = suffix_min_right[j+1]

current_min_right = min(left_part_min, right_part_min)

Then, compute current_length = max(0, current_min_right - current_max_left)

Now, the code needs to generate all these arrays and then loop through each j to compute the maximum possible current_length.

Now, considering the constraints: n up to 3e5. All these arrays can be computed in O(n) time, and then the loop is O(n) time, so overall O(n) time. Which should be acceptable.

But in Python, handling 3e5 elements is manageable as long as the code is optimized.

Potential issues:

- Handling the cases where j is 0 or n-1. Need to make sure that in those cases, the left_part or right_part are properly set to the correct values.

Testing the code with sample input 4:

Sample 4:

Input:

2

3 10

1 5

Segments:

l = [3,1]

r = [10,5]

Compute prefix_max_left:

prefix_max_left[0] =3

prefix_max_left[1] = max(3,1) =3

suffix_max_left[1] =1

suffix_max_left[0] = max(3,1)=3

prefix_min_right:

prefix_min_right[0] =10

prefix_min_right[1] = min(10,5)=5

suffix_min_right[1] =5

suffix_min_right[0] = min(10,5)=5

For j=0:

current_max_left = suffix_max_left[1] =1.

current_min_right = min(prefix_min_right[j-1] (invalid j=0, so left_part_min is infinity) and suffix_min_right[1] (which is 5). So current_min_right =5. 5-1=4.

For j=1:

current_max_left = prefix_max_left[0] =3.

current_min_right = min(prefix_min_right[0] (10) and suffix_min_right[2] (invalid, so right_part_min is infinity. So min is 10. So 10-3=7. Which is correct.

So the code would output 7.

Yes, correct.

Now, code implementation.

First, read the input.

In Python, for n up to 3e5, reading via stdin can be slow if using input() for each line. So it's better to read all input at once.

But in Python, even with 3e5 lines, using sys.stdin.read().split() is manageable.

So code steps:

Read n.

Then read n lines, each with l_i and r_i. Collect them into two lists: l and r.

Compute prefix_max_left, suffix_max_left.

Compute prefix_min_right, suffix_min_right.

Then, iterate through each j, compute current_max_left and current_min_right, calculate the length, track the maximum.

Now, code:

Import sys.

Read n.

Then read n lines. But for speed, read all input at once.

Something like:

import sys

n = int(sys.stdin.readline())

l = []
r = []
for _ in range(n):
    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    l.append(a)
    r.append(b)

Then compute prefix_max_left:

prefix_max_left = [0]*n
prefix_max_left[0] = l[0]
for i in range(1, n):
    prefix_max_left[i] = max(prefix_max_left[i-1], l[i])

suffix_max_left = [0]*n
suffix_max_left[-1] = l[-1]
for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
    suffix_max_left[i] = max(l[i], suffix_max_left[i+1])

Similarly for prefix_min_right and suffix_min_right.

prefix_min_right = [0]*n
prefix_min_right[0] = r[0]
for i in range(1, n):
    prefix_min_right[i] = min(prefix_min_right[i-1], r[i])

suffix_min_right = [0]*n
suffix_min_right[-1] = r[-1]
for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
    suffix_min_right[i] = min(r[i], suffix_min_right[i+1])

Then loop through each j.

max_length = 0

for j in range(n):
    # compute current_max_left
    if j ==0:
        left_max = -float('inf')
    else:
        left_max = prefix_max_left[j-1]
    if j ==n-1:
        right_max = -float('inf')
    else:
        right_max = suffix_max_left[j+1]
    current_max_left = max(left_max, right_max)
    
    # compute current_min_right
    if j ==0:
        left_min = float('inf')
    else:
        left_min = prefix_min_right[j-1]
    if j ==n-1:
        right_min = float('inf')
    else:
        right_min = suffix_min_right[j+1]
    current_min_right = min(left_min, right_min)
    
    current_length = max(0, current_min_right - current_max_left)
    if current_length > max_length:
        max_length = current_length

print(max_length)

This should work.
