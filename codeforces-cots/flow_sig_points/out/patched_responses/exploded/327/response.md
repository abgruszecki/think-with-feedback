Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to reverse a subarray in a sequence of 1s and 2s such that the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the resulting array is as long as possible. We need to find the maximum possible length after choosing the best possible reversal.

Hmm, first, the initial approach. Let's think about the constraints. The maximum n is 2000. So any O(n^3) algorithm would be 2000^3 = 8e10 operations, which is way too big. So we need a smarter approach.

What's the LNDS for the original array? For a non-decreasing sequence of 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be found by counting the transitions between 1s and 2s. But when we reverse a subarray, how does that affect the LNDS?

Wait, but when you reverse a subarray, the elements in that subarray are reversed. So for example, if the subarray is [1,2,1], reversing it becomes [1,2,1] again. Wait, no: wait, reversing [1,2,1] would become [1,2,1] reversed as [1,2,1] reversed is [1,2,1] again? Wait, no. Wait, original indices l to r. Suppose l=1, r=3. The original array is [1,2,1]. Reversing gives [1,2,1] reversed as [1,2,1] reversed? No, the array would be reversed from l to r. So 1,2,1 becomes 1,2,1 when reversed. Wait, no. Wait, the indices are 0-based or 1-based? The problem statement uses 1-based for l and r. So reversing a subarray [2,3] in the first example (the array is 1 2 1 2) would take positions 2 and 3 (assuming 1-based). So the original subarray is [2,1], reversed becomes [1,2]. So the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which gives a LNDS of length 4.

So the key is that reversing a subarray can change the order of elements in that subarray, which may help in creating a longer non-decreasing sequence.

But how can we find the optimal reversal that maximizes the LNDS?

Let's think about possible scenarios. The optimal LNDS after reversal could be formed by elements before the reversed subarray, some elements within the reversed subarray, and elements after. So perhaps the reversed subarray allows for more 1s followed by 2s in the reversed order.

Wait, maybe the reversed subarray would be a segment that, when reversed, has a longer run of 1s followed by 2s, thereby contributing to a longer LNDS.

Alternatively, the best reversal could be one that allows the maximum possible 1s in the left part and 2s in the right part. For example, if there's a segment that's 2 followed by 1, reversing it would make 1 followed by 2, which could help.

But how do we model this?

The straightforward approach would be to consider all possible subarrays [l, r], reverse them, compute the LNDS for each, and take the maximum. But that's O(n^2) possible subarrays, and for each, computing the LNDS is O(n). So total O(n^3) time, which is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter way.

So we need a way to compute the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal without checking all possible subarrays.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to model the possible maximum contributions from different parts of the array when a certain subarray is reversed.

Let me think about the structure of the LNDS. Since the array consists of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is essentially a sequence that starts with some 1s followed by some 2s. The maximum possible LNDS is the number of 1s before the first 2 plus the number of 2s from that 2 onwards. Wait, but this is for the case where all 1s are before all 2s. However, the actual array might have 1s and 2s interspersed, so the optimal LNDS would be the maximum count of 1s up to some position plus the number of 2s from that position onwards.

Wait, but that's not exactly true. Because the LNDS can have 1s and 2s in a non-decreasing order. So for example, in the array [1,2,1,2], the LNDS can be all 4 elements, but in the original array, the LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2). But after reversing the middle two elements, it becomes [1,1,2,2], which has a LNDS of 4.

So the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum of the original LNDS and some improved version after reversal.

But how to model the best possible reversal.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that after reversing a subarray [l, r], the array becomes a[1..l-1] + reversed(a[l..r]) + a[r+1..n].

We need to find the maximum LNDS across all possible such reversals.

But computing this for each possible [l, r] is too slow.

Another idea: The LNDS after reversal can be decomposed into parts before the reversed subarray, the reversed subarray itself, and after. So perhaps we can precompute for all possible l and r the maximum possible contributions from the reversed subarray and the surrounding parts.

Alternatively, for each possible interval [l, r], compute the maximum number of 1s in the prefix up to l-1, the maximum number of 2s in the suffix after r, and then compute the maximum possible 1s followed by 2s in the reversed subarray.

Wait, that sounds promising. Let's break it down.

Suppose we reverse the interval [l, r]. The reversed subarray is a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]. So the structure is:

prefix (a[1..l-1]) + reversed(a[l..r]) (call this S) + suffix (a[r+1..n]).

The LNDS can be made up of:

- Some 1s from the prefix.

- Some 1s and 2s from S.

- Some 2s from the suffix.

The maximum possible LNDS for this arrangement is:

(number of 1s in prefix up to l-1) + (max 1s followed by 2s in S) + (number of 2s in suffix from r+1 onwards).

Additionally, we can also have sequences that are entirely within the prefix, S, and suffix, but combining them as described might give a longer sequence.

So the idea is to find, for each possible [l, r], the sum of the counts of 1s in the prefix, the maximum possible 1s followed by 2s in the reversed subarray S, and the count of 2s in the suffix. Then take the maximum of all these sums.

But how to compute this efficiently.

First, precompute the number of 1s up to each index (prefix_ones), and the number of 2s after each index (suffix_twos).

Then, for each possible [l, r], compute:

left_ones = prefix_ones[l-1]

right_twos = suffix_twos[r+1]

And then, within the reversed subarray S (which is a[l..r] reversed), compute the maximum length of a non-decreasing sequence. But since S is reversed, the original a[l..r] is reversed. So S is a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]. So the maximum non-decreasing sequence in S would be the maximum of:

the number of 1s followed by 2s in S. For example, in S, how many 1s are there before the first 2, plus the number of 2s from there on. Or, perhaps the longest non-decreasing subsequence in S.

Wait, but the longest non-decreasing subsequence in S is the same as the longest non-decreasing subsequence in the original a[l..r], since reversing doesn't change the order of the elements. Wait, no. Because the elements are reversed. For example, if a[l..r] is [2,1,2], then reversed it becomes [2,1,2]. Wait, no. Wait, the original is a[l] = 2, a[l+1] =1, a[r] =2. So reversed S would be 2,1,2. Then the LNDS here is 2 (like 2,2). But the original a[l..r] is [2,1,2], which has LNDS of length 3 (2,1,2 is non-decreasing? No, 1 is less than 2. Wait, the LNDS for the original is 2,1,2 â†’ the non-decreasing sequences are [2,2], [2,1,2] is not non-decreasing. Wait, no. The sequence must be non-decreasing. So in [2,1,2], the LNDS is 2, which is the maximum of either 2,2 or 2,1 (but 1 <2, so no). Wait, the LNDS here is 2 (the two 2s). Wait, but if you reverse the array to get [2,1,2], then the same as before. Hmm, so the LNDS of S is the same as the LNDS of the original a[l..r], because reversing doesn't affect the order of elements in a way that the subsequence can be rearranged. Wait, no. For example, if the original is [1,2,1], then reversed it's [1,2,1]. The LNDS here is 2 (like 1,2). But the original reversed array may have a different LNDS. Wait, no, because the elements are the same. So the maximum LNDS of the reversed subarray is the same as the original. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify.

The LNDS is the maximum possible length of a subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) that is non-decreasing. Reversing the order of the elements in a subarray can change the possible subsequences. For example, take the subarray [1,3,2]. The LNDS here is 2 (1,3). If we reverse it to [2,3,1], the LNDS is 2 (2,3). So the LNDS can be different. But in the case of 1s and 2s, maybe there's a pattern.

Wait, in the problem, the elements are only 1 and 2. So in any subarray, the LNDS is the maximum between the number of 1s plus the number of 2s (if all 1s are before 2s), or the maximum run of 1s followed by 2s. But when reversed, the subarray may have a different arrangement. For example, if the original subarray is [2,2,1], then the reversed subarray is [1,2,2]. In this case, the LNDS of the reversed subarray is 3 (all elements), whereas the original had a LNDS of 2 (the two 2s). So this is better.

Ah, right. So the LNDS of the reversed subarray can be longer than that of the original. So we need to compute, for each possible reversed subarray [l, r], the maximum possible LNDS within that reversed subarray, and then combine it with the prefix and suffix counts.

Wait, but how can we compute the maximum LNDS within the reversed subarray efficiently for all possible l and r?

Alternatively, for each possible [l, r], compute the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s in the reversed subarray. For example, in the reversed subarray S (which is a[l..r] reversed), the maximum possible 1s followed by 2s. That is, the maximum number of 1s in the beginning of S, then the rest are 2s. Because that would give the maximum possible contribution when combining with the prefix (which has 1s) and the suffix (which has 2s).

But is that the case? For example, in the reversed subarray S, the optimal could be a run of 1s followed by 2s, which allows the maximum possible 1s from the prefix, then the 1s in S, then the 2s in S, then the 2s in the suffix. This would form a longer non-decreasing sequence.

So perhaps for each [l, r], we can compute:

max_1s_in_S_reversed: the number of consecutive 1s starting from the beginning of S (the reversed subarray).

max_2s_in_S_reversed: the number of consecutive 2s starting from the end of S.

Wait, no. Let's think: The reversed subarray S is a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]. So S starts with a[r], then a[r-1], etc.

In S, the maximum possible number of 1s followed by 2s would be the maximum count where we have some 1s at the start of S, then some 2s. For example, if S is [1,1,2,2], then the count is 4. If S is [1,2,1], then the maximum is 2 (the first two elements). If S is [2,1], then the count is 1 (the 1), but perhaps combining with the prefix and suffix, that's not helpful. Wait, but in this case, the reversed subarray S is [1,2], so the count is 2 (1 followed by 2). So the maximum for that S is 2.

So for each [l, r], when we reverse the subarray a[l..r], the S becomes a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]. The best possible contribution to the LNDS from S would be the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s in S. Because this would allow the prefix (with 1s) to contribute their count, then the 1s in S, then the 2s in S, then the suffix 2s. So the total would be left_ones (count of 1s in prefix) + (number of 1s in S's leading part) + (number of 2s in S's trailing part) + right_twos (count of 2s in suffix). But also, the 1s in S's leading part plus the 2s in S's trailing part can have overlapping (since the 1s can be followed by 2s in S).

Wait, perhaps for S, the maximum possible number of 1s followed by 2s is the maximum (number of 1s up to some position in S) plus (number of 2s from that position onwards in S). For example, in S, for each possible split point i in S (i ranges from 0 to len(S)), compute the number of 1s in the first i elements and the number of 2s in the remaining elements, and take the maximum over all i. Then add left_ones and right_twos to that.

But even that seems computationally heavy. But since the elements are only 1 and 2, perhaps we can precompute for all possible intervals [l, r] the maximum possible sum of 1s up to some point in the reversed subarray plus 2s after that point.

So here's the plan:

1. Precompute prefix_ones[i] = the number of 1s in a[1..i] (assuming 1-based indices). Similarly, suffix_twos[i] = the number of 2s in a[i..n].

2. For each possible interval [l, r], compute the reversed subarray S = a[l..r] reversed. For S, compute the maximum possible value of (number of 1s in the prefix of S) + (number of 2s in the suffix of S). Let's call this value max_s.

3. The total candidate for this [l, r] is left_ones = prefix_ones[l-1], plus max_s, plus right_twos = suffix_twos[r+1]. We take the maximum of all such candidates, as well as the original LNDS (without any reversal).

4. The answer is the maximum among all these candidates and the original LNDS.

Now, the question is: how to compute max_s for all possible [l, r] efficiently.

But for each [l, r], S is a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]. So the reversed array of a[l..r] is the same as reading a from r down to l.

So to compute max_s for S, which is the reversed a[l..r], we can think of S as the array starting at a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]. So S is a sequence of (r - l + 1) elements.

For this S, we need to find the maximum sum of 1s in some prefix of S plus 2s in the corresponding suffix. For example, split S into two parts: the first part (up to index i) and the second part (from index i+1). The sum is the number of 1s in the first part plus the number of 2s in the second part. We need to find the maximum over all possible splits (including splitting at 0, which means the first part is empty and the second is all 2s; or splitting at the end, which means the first part is all 1s and the second is empty).

So for S, the maximum such sum is the maximum of:

sum_1s[0..i] + sum_2s[i+1..end], for all i from -1 (split before first element) to end.

But how do we compute this for all possible [l, r] efficiently?

An O(n^2) approach would be to precompute for all possible intervals [l, r] the maximum sum as described. Then, for each [l, r], compute the sum left_ones + max_s + right_twos.

But with n=2000, that's O(n^2) intervals, each of which can take up to O(n) time to compute max_s, leading to O(n^3) time, which is 8e9 operations, which is way too slow.

We need a way to compute max_s for all intervals [l, r] in O(n^2) time.

Hmm. Let's think about the elements. Since the elements are 1s and 2s, perhaps there's a way to model this.

For any interval [l, r], when reversed, S is a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]. So the elements are in reverse order of the original array.

The maximum sum for S is the maximum over all possible splits of the sum of 1s in the first part and 2s in the second part.

Let's think of S as a new array. For example, for each possible split i (0 <= i <= len(S)), the first i elements are the first part (sum of 1s), and the remaining len(S) - i elements are the second part (sum of 2s).

But this is equivalent to the maximum over all i of (number of 1s in the first i elements of S) + (number of 2s in the elements from i+1 onwards in S).

Let's denote this sum for S as the maximum of (count_1s(S[:i]) + count_2s(S[i:])).

Wait, but S[i:] includes the elements from index i onwards. So for i =0, it's the entire array. For i = len(S), it's the empty array.

So for a given S, the maximum sum is the maximum of:

sum_1s up to i (inclusive) in S + sum_2s from i+1 to end in S.

But how to compute this for all possible intervals efficiently.

An alternative approach: For each possible start and end of the reversed subarray, precompute the cumulative counts of 1s and 2s in reversed order.

Wait, but perhaps we can model for each possible l and r (the reversed subarray [l, r] in the original array), and then compute the required sum.

Let me think of the reversed subarray as being a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l].

Let's create for each possible l and r, the cumulative count of 1s and 2s in the reversed order.

Wait, but perhaps for each possible l, we can process r from l to n, and track the cumulative counts.

For example, for l fixed, and r increasing from l to n, the reversed subarray starts at a[r] (since for each step, r increases by 1, and the subarray becomes longer by 1 element). So for l fixed, the reversed subarray is [a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]] as r increases from l to n.

For each l, we can process all possible r >= l and compute the max_s for each [l, r] in O(1) per r.

How?

Let's think: For a fixed l, and varying r from l to n. The reversed subarray is a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]. Let's process each element a[r] as we move r from l to n.

Wait, for l=5, the reversed subarrays for r=5 is [a5], for r=6 is [a6, a5], etc.

For each such reversed subarray, the elements are being added to the front of the current reversed subarray. Wait, no. Because when r increases by 1, the reversed subarray [l, r] is a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]. So when r increases by 1, the new reversed subarray is a[r], followed by the previous reversed subarray (which was [l, r-1] as a[r-1], a[r-2], ..., a[l]).

So, for each l, we can process r from l to n, building the reversed subarray incrementally by adding the next element (a[r]) to the beginning.

Wait, for example, l=3, r=3: subarray is [a3]. r=4: subarray is [a4, a3]. r=5: [a5, a4, a3], etc. So each time r increases by 1, the new element a[r] is added to the front of the reversed subarray.

So for each l, the reversed subarray for r >= l is built by appending a[r] to the front as r increases. So the processing order for r is from l to n.

Now, for each l and r, when building the reversed subarray, we can track the cumulative counts of 1s and 2s, and track the maximum sum (sum_1s up to i + sum_2s from i+1) for each possible i.

But how?

Let's think: for each l, we can track for the reversed subarray up to r, the possible maximum sum. Let's see:

For the reversed subarray S when r is fixed (for a given l), S is a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l].

The elements of S are processed as a[r], a[r-1], etc. So for each l, as r increases, the reversed subarray is built by adding a new element to the front.

Now, for each step in r (from l to n), the reversed subarray S is a[r], followed by the previous reversed subarray (for r-1). So for example, when l=2 and r=4, S is a4, a3, a2. For r=5, S is a5, a4, a3, a2.

So, for each l, when processing r from l to n, the reversed subarray is the new element a[r] followed by the previous reversed subarray (which is for r-1).

Wait, no. For l=2 and r=3, the reversed subarray is a3, a2. For r=4, the reversed subarray is a4, a3, a2, a1? No, wait l is 2, so a[r] is a4, then a3, a2. So for l=2 and r=4, the reversed subarray is a4, a3, a2. So when r increases by 1 (from 3 to 4), the reversed subarray becomes a4 followed by the previous elements (a3, a2). So the reversed subarray grows by adding a[r] to the front.

So, for a fixed l, the reversed subarray for r is the sequence [a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]]. So each new r (from l to n) adds a new element to the front of the reversed subarray.

Now, to compute the max_s for each reversed subarray S (which is the maximum sum of 1s up to i plus 2s from i+1 in S), we can track certain variables as we build the reversed subarray incrementally.

Let's denote that for the current reversed subarray S (for l and current r), we track:

- The current count of 1s and 2s.

But how to track the maximum sum.

Alternatively, when a new element (x = a[r]) is added to the front of the reversed subarray S_prev (for r-1), the new reversed subarray S is [x] + S_prev.

For this new S, we need to compute the maximum sum of 1s in the first part and 2s in the second part.

Let's consider the possible splits in S. The split can be at 0 (the entire S is considered as the second part), or after the first element, etc.

The maximum sum for S can be obtained by either:

- Taking x as part of the first part (if x is 1), and then taking the best split from S_prev, which would be the maximum split for S_prev, adjusted by adding x's contribution.

Or:

- Taking x as part of the first part (if x is 1), then the split can be after x, leading to all elements in S_prev being part of the second part. So sum would be 1 (if x is 1) + the number of 2s in S_prev.

Similarly, if x is 2, then including it in the first part (which is 1s) is not possible, so the first part can only be up to 0 elements (if x is 2), so the split is after x, leading to the sum being 0 (from first part) + 1 (if x is 2) plus the number of 2s in S_prev.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's think recursively.

Let's suppose that for the previous S_prev (with r-1), we have the following information:

- best_prev: the maximum sum of 1s in a prefix plus 2s in the suffix for S_prev.

- count_1_prev: the total number of 1s in S_prev.

- count_2_prev: the total number of 2s in S_prev.

- max_ones_prev: the maximum number of 1s in any prefix of S_prev.

- max_twos_suffix: the maximum number of 2s in any suffix of S_prev.

But this might not help directly. Alternatively, when we add x to the front of S_prev, the new S is x followed by S_prev.

So for the new S, the maximum sum can be computed as follows:

Case 1: x is 1. Then, if we take x into the first part, then for each possible split in S_prev, the new split would be after x plus some split in S_prev. The best split for S_prev is the one that gives the maximum sum of 1s in the first part and 2s in the second part. So adding x (which is 1) to the first part would increase the count of 1s in the first part by 1. Alternatively, the split could be after x, leading to x being part of the first part (if x is 1), and then the entire S_prev is part of the second part (sum of 2s in S_prev).

So for the new S, the maximum sum is the maximum of:

- (1 (if x is 1) + best_prev) â†’ this is when x is added to the first part, and the best split from S_prev is considered.

- (1 + count_2_prev) â†’ this is when the split is after x, so the first part is x (1), and the second part is S_prev, which contributes count_2_prev (number of 2s in S_prev).

If x is 2, then it can't be part of the first part (since the first part is 1s). So the split must be after x, so the first part is 0, and the second part is x (2) plus S_prev. But since x is 2, the second part is all 2s. So the sum is 0 + (1 (if x is 2) + count_2_prev) + sum_2s in S_prev. Wait, no. The sum would be the number of 2s in the new S. Which is (1 if x is 2) plus count_2_prev.

Wait, for x=2, the split is after 0 elements. So the first part is empty (0 1s), and the second part is x followed by S_prev. The number of 2s in the second part is (if x is 2, which contributes 1) plus the number of 2s in S_prev.

So for x=2, the sum for this split is 0 (1s in first part) + (1 + count_2_prev) (2s in second part).

But also, other splits are possible. For example, the split could be after the first element (x), then the sum would be (0 for first part, since x is 2) plus the best split of S_prev. So the sum would be 0 + best_prev (which includes the best split of S_prev).

But best_prev could be the maximum between taking splits in S_prev. So the maximum sum for x=2 would be the maximum between (0 + best_prev) and (1 + count_2_prev).

Wait, but the best_prev could already include scenarios where the first part is 1s in S_prev. So adding x=2 to the front, the split after x would mean that the first part is x (2, which can't be part of the 1s), so the first part is empty. Then the split in S_prev is considered, which could be any possible split. But the best_prev already represents the maximum possible sum for S_prev.

So for x=2, the maximum sum for the new S is the maximum between:

- 0 (from first part) + best_prev (from S_prev's splits)

and

- 0 (first part is empty) + (number of 2s in S_prev + 1 (x is 2)).

But why not consider other splits?

Actually, the splits for the new S can be anywhere between 0 and len(S). So when x is 2, the best split could be:

- split after 0 elements: sum is 0 + (number of 2s in new S) â†’ which is 1 (x is 2) + count_2_prev (number of 2s in S_prev).

- split after 1 element (x): sum is 0 (x is 2, not part of first part) + best_prev (which is the best possible sum for S_prev).

- split after more than 1 elements: but since x is 2, the first part cannot have any 1s beyond 0 elements. So the first part would have 0 elements (since x is 2) and any split in S_prev. So the sum is 0 + best_prev.

So for x=2, the maximum sum is max( best_prev, 1 + count_2_prev ).

Similarly, for x=1:

The split can be after 0 elements (sum is 0 + best_prev), after 1 element (sum is 1 + best_prev), after 1 element and then the sum from S_prev's splits. Or, the split can be after 1 element, which is x (1), and then the rest of S_prev is part of the second part (sum is 1 (x) + count_2_prev).

So for x=1, the possible options are:

- split after 0 elements: sum is 0 + best_prev.

- split after 1 element: sum is 1 (x is 1) + count_2_prev.

- split after more than 1 elements: sum is 1 (x is 1) + best_prev (but best_prev could already include splits that start with 1s in S_prev).

Wait, but this is not correct. Because if we split after the first element (x=1), then the second part is S_prev. The number of 2s in the second part is count_2_prev. So the sum is 1 + count_2_prev. Alternatively, if we split after x and then have a split in S_prev, that would give 1 + best_prev. But best_prev is the maximum sum for S_prev, which could be more than count_2_prev.

So for x=1, the maximum sum is the maximum between:

- best_prev + 1 (since x is added to the first part, but how?)

Wait, perhaps this requires more careful analysis.

When x is 1, adding it to the front of S_prev:

The possible splits in the new S are:

- split after 0 elements â†’ sum is 0 (no 1s) + sum_2s of entire new S (which is 1 (if x is 1, which is not 2) plus sum_2s of S_prev â†’ which is sum_2_prev. So this sum is sum_2_prev + 0 (since x is 1, not 2) â†’ sum_2_prev.

Wait, no. The split after 0 elements: the first part is empty (0 1s), the second part is the entire new S (x followed by S_prev). The sum is the number of 2s in the entire new S. x is 1, which contributes 0 to the sum. The sum_2_prev is the number of 2s in S_prev. So this sum is sum_2_prev.

Alternatively, split after 1 element (x is in the first part). Then the first part has 1 element (x=1) and the sum is 1 (number of 1s) plus the sum of 2s in the remaining elements (S_prev). So the sum is 1 + sum_2_prev.

Or, split after 1 + k elements, where k is a split in S_prev. So the first part is x followed by the first k elements of S_prev, and the second part is the remaining elements of S_prev. The sum would be 1 (x) + (number of 1s in the first k elements of S_prev) + (number of 2s in the remaining elements of S_prev). But this is exactly 1 + the best_prev for S_prev. So the sum is 1 + best_prev.

Therefore, for x=1, the maximum sum is the maximum between:

- sum_2_prev â†’ split after 0 elements.

- 1 + sum_2_prev â†’ split after 1 element.

- 1 + best_prev â†’ split after more than 1 elements.

So the maximum of these three options.

But how do we compute this efficiently for each step.

This suggests that for each l, as we process r from l to n, we can track:

- best_current: the maximum sum for the current reversed subarray (for l and r).

- sum_2_current: the number of 2s in the current reversed subarray.

- sum_1_current: the number of 1s in the current reversed subarray.

Wait, but sum_1_current plus sum_2_current equals the length of the reversed subarray (since elements are only 1 and 2).

But for each new element x (a[r]) added to the front of the reversed subarray:

If x is 1:

sum_1_current_new = sum_1_prev + 1

sum_2_current_new = sum_2_prev

sum_2_in_new_S = sum_2_current_new (since x is 1, which contributes 0 to the 2s)

best_current_new = max( best_prev + 1, 1 + sum_2_prev, sum_2_prev )

Wait, no:

For x=1:

sum_2_in_new_S is sum_2_prev (since x is 1). So the split after 0 elements gives sum_2_prev.

The split after 1 element gives 1 (1s in first part) + sum_2_prev (2s in second part).

The split after more than 1 elements gives 1 (x) plus best_prev (which is the maximum sum for S_prev, which includes splits in S_prev).

So the best_current_new would be the maximum of these three options.

But how to compute this:

best_current_new = max( best_prev + 1, 1 + sum_2_prev, sum_2_prev )

But sum_2_prev is the number of 2s in S_prev. So sum_2_prev is sum_2_current_prev (sum_2_prev).

Similarly, for x=2:

sum_2_current_new = sum_2_prev + 1 (since x is 2).

sum_1_current_new = sum_1_prev.

The possible splits are:

- split after 0 elements: sum is sum_2_current_new (since x is 2, and the entire new S is in the second part).

- split after 1 element: sum is 0 (since x is 2) plus best_prev (sum for S_prev's splits).

So best_current_new for x=2 is max( sum_2_current_new, best_prev )

So putting this together, for each l, and for each r >= l, we can track:

current best, sum_2_current, sum_1_current.

But wait, sum_1_current and sum_2_current can be tracked as sum_1_prev + (x == 1) and sum_2_prev + (x ==2), but since for each l, we process r from l to n, the sum_1 and sum_2 for the reversed subarray [l, r] can be tracked incrementally.

So here's the plan:

For each l from 1 to n:

    Initialize sum_1 = 0, sum_2 = 0, best = 0.

    For r from l to n:

        x = a[r]

        if x == 1:

            new_sum_1 = sum_1 + 1

            new_sum_2 = sum_2

            candidate1 = best_prev + 1 (where best_prev is the previous best for r-1)

            candidate2 = 1 + sum_2_prev

            candidate3 = sum_2_prev

            new_best = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)

        else:  # x == 2

            new_sum_1 = sum_1

            new_sum_2 = sum_2 + 1

            candidate1 = sum_2_prev + 1  # sum_2_prev is sum_2 before adding x (which is sum_2_prev = sum_2)

            candidate2 = best_prev

            new_best = max(candidate1, candidate2)

        sum_1_prev = sum_1

        sum_2_prev = sum_2

        best_prev = best

        sum_1 = new_sum_1

        sum_2 = new_sum_2

        best = new_best

        # Now, compute left_ones = prefix_ones[l-1], right_twos = suffix_twos[r+1]

        current_total = prefix_ones[l-1] + best + suffix_twos[r+1]

        max_answer = max(max_answer, current_total)

But wait, initially for l and r=l:

The reversed subarray is [a[l]] (since l=r).

So when r starts at l, sum_1_prev is 0, sum_2_prev is 0, best_prev is 0.

For the first iteration (r=l):

if x is 1:

sum_1 becomes 1, sum_2 remains 0.

candidate1 = best_prev (0) + 1 â†’ 1 (but best_prev is 0, because before adding x, the sum_prev was 0).

candidate2 = 1 + sum_2_prev (0) â†’ 1.

candidate3 = sum_2_prev (0) â†’ 0.

so new_best is max(1,1,0) =1.

sum_1 =1, sum_2=0, best=1.

current_total = prefix_ones[l-1] + 1 + suffix_twos[r+1].

Similarly for x=2.

This approach seems correct.

Now, the variables sum_1_prev and sum_2_prev refer to the previous state (r-1). But when processing r from l to n, for each step, we need to track the previous sum_1, sum_2, and best.

Wait, but for each r in l..n, the initial state when r starts at l is sum_1_prev=0, sum_2_prev=0, best_prev=0. Then for r = l, the x is a[r], and the new sum_1 and sum_2 are computed. For r = l+1, x is a[r], and the previous state is the one from r=l.

So for each l, we can track:

current_sum_1 = 0

current_sum_2 = 0

current_best = 0

But wait, initially, for r=l-1, the reversed subarray is empty. Then, for r=l, the reversed subarray is [a[l]], and we process it.

But for l=1, r starts at 1, etc.

So the algorithm for each l would be:

Initialize:

sum_1 = 0

sum_2 = 0

best = 0

For r in l to n:

    x = a[r]

    if x == 1:

        new_sum_1 = sum_1 + 1

        new_sum_2 = sum_2

        candidate1 = best + 1  # previous best is for the reversed subarray up to r-1, which was best_prev. Then adding x=1 to the front, and taking the best_prev split plus 1 for x.

        candidate2 = 1 + sum_2  # split after x, sum_2 is the number of 2s in the previous subarray (which is sum_2_prev). But in the current setup, sum_2 is the sum_2_prev.

        candidate3 = sum_2  # split after 0 elements, sum_2_prev (sum_2_prev is sum_2 before adding x. Wait, no: when x=1 is added, sum_2_prev is sum_2 (previous sum_2), which is sum_2_prev = sum_2.

        new_best = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)

    else:

        new_sum_1 = sum_1

        new_sum_2 = sum_2 + 1

        candidate1 = sum_2 + 1  # sum_2_prev is sum_2 (before adding x), but x is 2, so sum_2_prev + 1 (since x is added to the sum_2).

        candidate2 = best  # split after x, sum is best_prev (sum_prev's best).

        new_best = max(candidate1, candidate2)

    # Update the variables for next iteration

    sum_1, sum_2 = new_sum_1, new_sum_2

    best = new_best

    # Compute current_total and update max_answer.

    current_total = prefix_ones[l-1] + best + suffix_twos[r+1]

    max_answer = max(max_answer, current_total)

Wait, but in the first step (r=l), for x=1, the sum_2_prev is sum_2, which is 0. So candidate2 is 1 + 0=1. candidate1 is best (0) +1=1. So new_best is max(1,1,0)=1. Which is correct.

For example, if the reversed subarray is [1], then the maximum sum is 1 (split after 1 element) â†’ 1 (1s) +0 (no 2s). Or split after 0 elements â†’ 0 (1s) +0 (2s in S). So the best is 1.

So this seems correct.

So the algorithm works as follows:

For each l from 1 to n:

    Initialize sum_1, sum_2, best to 0.

    For r from l to n:

        x = a[r]

        compute new_sum_1, new_sum_2, new_best based on x.

        compute current_total = prefix_ones[l-1] + new_best + suffix_twos[r+1]

        update max_answer.

But how to precompute prefix_ones and suffix_twos.

prefix_ones[i] is the number of 1s in the first i elements (assuming 1-based indexing).

Wait, perhaps:

prefix_ones[0] = 0.

for i from 1 to n:

    prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (a[i] == 1)

Similarly, suffix_twos[i] is the number of 2s from position i to n.

suffix_twos[n+1] =0.

for i from n down to 1:

    suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (a[i] ==2)

So for l-1, prefix_ones[l-1] is the number of 1s in the prefix up to position l-1 (which is 1-based).

For example, l=1: prefix_ones[0] =0. r+1 would be 1 to n+1.

So, for each l and r in the loop, the current_total is prefix_ones[l-1] + best + suffix_twos[r+1].

This gives the maximum possible sum for the reversed subarray [l, r].

But we also need to consider the original LNDS (without any reversal), as well as the best possible [l, r] that maximizes current_total.

So the steps are:

1. Compute the original LNDS.

2. Compute the maximum current_total over all possible [l, r].

3. The answer is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum current_total.

But wait, the original LNDS could be higher than any possible reversal. For example, if the array is already all 1s followed by all 2s, then reversing any subarray can't improve the LNDS.

So how do we compute the original LNDS?

For the original array, the LNDS can be computed using the standard DP approach, which is O(n^2), but for n=2000, that's 4e6 operations, which is acceptable.

Alternatively, for an array of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s up to i plus the number of 2s from i onwards, for all possible i. Because the optimal sequence is a prefix of 1s and a suffix of 2s.

For example, for the original array, the maximum LNDS is:

max( (number of 1s in [1..i]) + (number of 2s in [i..n]) ) for i from 0 to n.

Because the best subsequence is to take all 1s up to i, then all 2s from i onwards. Wait, but the 2s from i onwards can be anywhere in the array. So this approach would find the maximum.

So for the original array, the maximum LNDS can be computed as:

max_original = 0

for i from 0 to n:

    count_1 = prefix_ones[i]

    count_2 = suffix_twos[i+1]

    max_original = max(max_original, count_1 + count_2)

So this is O(n) time.

So the overall steps are:

- Precompute prefix_ones and suffix_twos.

- Compute max_original.

- For each possible l and r, compute current_total and keep track of the maximum.

- The answer is the maximum between max_original and the maximum current_total.

So putting it all together:

Compute prefix_ones:

prefix_ones = [0] * (n+1)

for i in range(1, n+1):

    prefix_ones[i] = prefix_ones[i-1] + (a[i] == 1)

Compute suffix_twos:

suffix_twos = [0] * (n+2)

for i in range(n, 0, -1):

    suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (a[i] == 2)

Compute max_original:

max_original = 0

for i in range(0, n+1):

    # i is the split point between 1-based indices.

    # prefix_ones[i] is the number of 1s up to i.

    # suffix_twos[i+1] is the number of 2s from i+1 to n.

    current = prefix_ones[i] + suffix_twos[i+1]

    if current > max_original:

        max_original = current

Then, compute the maximum current_total over all possible l and r.

Initialize max_answer = max_original.

Then for each l in 1 to n:

    sum_1 = 0

    sum_2 = 0

    best = 0

    for r in l to n:

        x = a[r]

        if x ==1:

            new_sum_1 = sum_1 +1

            new_sum_2 = sum_2

            candidate1 = best +1

            candidate2 = 1 + sum_2

            candidate3 = sum_2

            new_best = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)

        else:

            new_sum_1 = sum_1

            new_sum_2 = sum_2 +1

            candidate1 = sum_2 +1  # sum_2 is the previous sum_2 before adding x. Now, x is 2, so sum_2 increases by 1.

            candidate2 = best

            new_best = max(candidate1, candidate2)

        sum_1, sum_2 = new_sum_1, new_sum_2

        best = new_best

        current_total = prefix_ones[l-1] + best + suffix_twos[r+1]

        if current_total > max_answer:

            max_answer = current_total

Finally, the answer is max_answer.

But wait, for the original array, the maximum LNDS is computed as the max of prefix_ones[i] + suffix_twos[i+1], which is correct. Because this represents taking all 1s up to i and all 2s after i.

But in the reversed subarray scenario, the current_total is computed as prefix_ones[l-1] (1s before l) + best (max 1s followed by 2s in reversed subarray) + suffix_twos[r+1] (2s after r). This represents taking all 1s from the prefix, the best possible 1s followed by 2s from the reversed subarray, and all 2s from the suffix.

This could indeed give a better result than the original array's maximum.

So this approach should work.

Now, let's test this logic against the first example.

First example input:

4

1 2 1 2

prefix_ones is [0,1,1,2,2]

suffix_twos is [0,3,2,2,1,0]

max_original is computed as:

for i from 0 to 4:

i=0: 0 + suffix_twos[1] (3) â†’ 3.

i=1: 1 + suffix_twos[2] (2) â†’ 3.

i=2: 1 + suffix_twos[3] (2) â†’3.

i=3: 2 + suffix_twos[4] (1) â†’3.

i=4: 2 + suffix_twos[5] (0) â†’2.

So max_original is 3.

Now, compute for l=2, r=3.

In the original array, the reversed subarray is a[2..3] reversed: a[3]=1, a[2]=2 â†’ [1,2].

sum_1 starts at 0, sum_2=0, best=0.

Processing r=2:

x = a[2] =2.

x is 2:

new_sum_1 =0, sum_2 becomes 0+1=1.

candidate1 = sum_2_prev (0) +1 â†’1.

candidate2 = best_prev (0).

new_best = max(1,0) â†’1.

current_total = prefix_ones[1] (1) + 1 + suffix_twos[3] (2) â†’ 1+1+2=4.

So this is the candidate for l=2, r=2. But in the first example, the correct reversal is l=2, r=3.

Processing r=3 for l=2:

sum_1 and sum_2 are updated from the previous step (r=2):

sum_1 is 0, sum_2 is1, best is1.

Now, r=3:

x = a[3] =1.

x is 1:

new_sum_1 =0+1=1, sum_2 remains 1.

candidate1 = best_prev (1) +1 â†’2.

candidate2 =1 + sum_2_prev (1) â†’2.

candidate3 = sum_2_prev (1) â†’1.

new_best = max(2,2,1) â†’2.

current_total = prefix_ones[1] (1) +2 + suffix_twos[4] (1) â†’1+2+1=4.

So this is the correct answer.

Yes, the code would capture this.

So this approach works.

Now, implementing this in Python.

The steps:

Read n, read the array (assuming 1-based or 0-based? Need to be careful.)

But in the code, the array is 1-based for the prefix and suffix arrays.

So in Python, the input can be read as a list, then a[1], a[2], ... a[n] are the elements.

But Python lists are 0-based, so when we read the input as list, we can pad the list with a dummy element at index 0.

For example:

n = int(input())

a = list(map(int, input().split()))

# pad a to be 1-based.

a = [0] + a

Then, prefix_ones[i] represents the number of 1s in the first i elements.

Similarly for suffix_twos.

Now, let's code this.

Then, compute prefix_ones and suffix_twos.

Then compute max_original.

Then, for each l from 1 to n:

    sum_1, sum_2, best = 0, 0, 0

    for r in range(l, n+1):

        x = a[r]

        if x == 1:

            new_sum_1 = sum_1 + 1

            new_sum_2 = sum_2

            candidate1 = best + 1

            candidate2 = 1 + sum_2

            candidate3 = sum_2

            new_best = max(candidate1, candidate2, candidate3)

        else:

            new_sum_1 = sum_1

            new_sum_2 = sum_2 + 1

            candidate1 = sum_2 + 1

            candidate2 = best

            new_best = max(candidate1, candidate2)

        # update variables

        sum_1, sum_2 = new_sum_1, new_sum_2

        best = new_best

        # compute current_total

        current_total = prefix_ones[l-1] + best + suffix_twos[r+1]

        if current_total > max_answer:

            max_answer = current_total

Finally, the answer is max_answer.

So the code should look like this.

Testing against sample input 1.

```python
def main(input_stream, output_stream):
    n = int(input_stream.readline().rstrip("\n"))

            if current_total > max_answer:

    print(max_answer, file=output_stream)

The second sample input:

10

1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1

After reversal of [3,7], the array becomes:

1 1 (reversed of 2,2,2,1,1) â†’ 1,1,2,2,2 â†’ then 2,2,1.

So the array becomes:

[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]

The LNDS is 9.

But according to the code, during the processing of l=3 and r=7.

But I'll skip the detailed steps here. The code should handle it correctly.

Thus, the code should work.

```python
n = int(input())

prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)
