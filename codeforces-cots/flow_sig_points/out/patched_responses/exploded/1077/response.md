<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about handling a graph with dynamic edge weight updates and answering shortest path queries. The constraints are tight, especially considering that m and n can be up to 1e5, and q is up to 2000. Also, each query of the second type can add multiple edges, but the total across all such queries is up to 1e6. So we need an efficient way to handle these updates and answer the queries quickly.

First, let's understand the problem. For each type 1 query, we need the shortest path from 1 to v. For type 2, we add 1 to the weights of certain edges. The key here is that these updates are cumulative. So each time a type 2 query is processed, the affected edges' weights increase by 1, and this affects future queries.

The main challenge is handling the updates efficiently and recomputing the shortest paths as needed. Since the updates are additive and happen in batches, we need to find a way to model this without recomputing everything from scratch each time.

Let me think about the standard approaches for dynamic shortest paths. Normally, Dijkstra's algorithm is O(M + N log N) per run, which is manageable for a single run. But if after each update we have to run Dijkstra again, that's O(q * (M + N log N)), which with q=2000 and M=1e5 could be 2e8 operations. That's probably too slow, especially given that each Dijkstra run could take a while. But wait, maybe there's a smarter way here.

Wait, the type 2 queries are adding 1 to a set of edges. So each edge's weight is initial weight plus the number of times it's been selected in type 2 queries. Let's model this as each edge l has a base weight c_l, and a delta count k_l (number of times it's been updated). The current weight is c_l + k_l. So whenever a type 2 query comes in, we increment k_l for each edge in the list.

But how does this affect the shortest paths? Each time the weights of certain edges are increased, the shortest paths could change. However, recomputing the shortest paths from scratch for every update is expensive. So we need a way to handle these incremental changes efficiently.

Wait, but what if we model the problem by precomputing some information that allows us to adjust the distances when edges are updated? Let's think: the initial state has all edges at their base weights. Then, each type 2 query adds 1 to some edges. So the current weight of edge l is c_l + sum of times it's been included in type 2 queries.

Hmm. So each time a type 2 query is processed, the affected edges' current weights increase by 1, which affects all future queries. So the problem is dynamic in the sense that edges can be modified, and we need to answer shortest path queries after these modifications.

Now, the problem is to handle these updates efficiently and answer the shortest path queries. So what's the most efficient way?

Let's consider the possible approaches:

1. Recompute the shortest paths from scratch after each type 2 query. But with q=2000 and each Dijkstra being O(M + N log N), this would be 2000 * (1e5 + 1e5 log 1e5) operations. Let's see: 1e5 log 1e5 is around 1e5 * 17 ≈ 1.7e6. So each Dijkstra is roughly 1.8e6 operations. Multiply by 2000 gives 3.6e9 operations, which is way too much for 10 seconds. Python can handle about 1e8 operations per second, so this is 3.6e9 which is 36 seconds. So this approach is not feasible.

2. Find a way to represent the current state in a way that allows incremental updates to the distances. For example, if the graph has certain properties, like being a DAG or having non-negative edges (which Dijkstra requires), but even then, handling edge increases might be tricky. Because when edges' weights increase, the distances can only increase or stay the same. Wait, no. For example, if you have a path that uses an edge that's increased, its distance could increase, but maybe another path that was previously longer becomes better. So it's not straightforward.

Wait, in our problem, edges are directed and their weights are being increased. So when we add 1 to certain edges, all the paths that include those edges will have their total distance increased by the number of those edges in the path. So, the problem is that after each update, some edges' weights go up, which might invalidate the current shortest paths.

But recomputing the shortest paths each time is expensive. So perhaps, given that the type 2 queries are up to 2000, and the type 1 queries can be answered with the current state, maybe there's a way to batch process the updates and recompute the shortest paths once per type 2 query.

Wait, but even that might be feasible. Let's see: 2000 type 2 queries. For each, after applying the delta, we need to recompute the shortest paths. But 2000 * Dijkstra's time. As discussed earlier, that's 3.6e9 operations, which is too much. So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative approach: note that each type 2 query adds 1 to a set of edges. Since edges can be added multiple times (they can be in multiple type 2 queries), each edge's weight is its base weight plus the number of times it's been updated. So the current weight of edge l is c_l + k_l, where k_l is the count of how many times it's been included in type 2 queries.

So for each edge, we can track the number of times it's been updated. Then, when answering a type 1 query, the edge weights are the base plus their update count. But how to compute the shortest paths efficiently when the weights are dynamic like this?

The problem is that the edge weights are dynamic and can change after each type 2 query. So the standard approach is to model this as a dynamic graph and use a data structure that can handle updates and answer shortest path queries efficiently.

But in practice, dynamic graphs are hard to handle efficiently, especially with a mix of updates and queries. For this problem, perhaps there's a smarter approach considering the way the edge weights are modified.

Wait, let's consider the following:

Each time a type 2 query is processed, the weight of certain edges increases by 1. So, the current weight of each edge is c_l + sum_{queries in which l is selected}.

But how does this affect the shortest paths? For example, when we process a type 2 query, the edges' weights increase, which can make some paths longer. But if the current shortest path doesn't use any of these edges, then the distance remains the same. Otherwise, it might increase.

But recomputing the shortest path from scratch each time a type 2 query comes in is expensive. So perhaps, we can find a way to represent the problem such that each type 2 query can be processed with minimal recomputation.

Alternative idea: since each type 2 query adds 1 to some edges, perhaps we can model the total added to each edge and use a modified Dijkstra's algorithm that takes into account the current counts. But then, each time a type 1 query comes, we have to compute the shortest path with the current counts, which could be O(M + N log N) per query. However, if there are a lot of type 1 queries, this is not feasible.

But in the problem, the queries can be mixed. So for example, there could be 2000 type 2 queries and 2000 type 1 queries, each of which requires a Dijkstra run. That's 2000 Dijkstra runs, which again might be too slow.

Wait, but the constraints on q are up to 2000. Let's think: each type 1 query would require a Dijkstra run. If there are 2000 type 1 queries, each requiring O(M + N log N) time, that's 2000 * (1e5 + 1e5 log 1e5) ≈ 3.6e9 operations, which is way beyond Python's capabilities. So that's not feasible.

So we need a better approach. Let's think differently.

What if we can represent the problem in terms of the original edge weights plus the sum of the updates, and find a way to compute the shortest paths efficiently by precomputing some information that allows us to adjust for the updates without recomputing everything from scratch?

For example, suppose that we precompute all possible updates. But since the number of possible combinations is huge, that's not feasible.

Alternative approach: Notice that the updates are additive. Each edge's weight is c_l + k_l, where k_l is the number of times it's been included in a type 2 query. So, after each type 2 query, the k_l's for the edges in that query increase by 1.

Now, the distance from 1 to v is the minimum over all possible paths from 1 to v of the sum (c_l + k_l) for each edge l in the path. So, the distance can be written as sum(c_l) over the path + sum(k_l) over the edges in the path.

But sum(k_l) for the edges in the path is equal to the number of times each edge in the path was included in any type 2 query. Let's model this as:

distance = (sum of c_l in the path) + (sum over all type 2 queries of the number of edges in the path that were in that query).

Wait, because each time a type 2 query adds edges l1, l2, ..., lc, all those edges' k_l increases by 1. So, the sum for a path is the initial sum (sum c_l) plus the sum over all edges in the path of the number of times they were in a type 2 query.

But that's equivalent to sum c_l + sum (number of times each edge in the path was updated).

But sum (number of times each edge in the path was updated) is equal to the sum over all type 2 queries of the count of edges in the path that are in that query. Because for each query, if the query includes edge l, then k_l increases by 1, so each occurrence of l in a query contributes 1 to each path that includes l.

So the total added to the path's sum is the number of times any edge in the path was part of a type 2 query.

This seems a bit abstract. Let's think of it as for each type 2 query, when it is processed, the current sum of the edges in the path that are included in this query increases by 1 each.

Wait, maybe the problem can be rephrased as: each type 2 query contributes 1 to each edge in the current list, which adds 1 per edge in the path that is in that query. So, the total added for a path is the number of times edges in the path were included in type 2 queries.

Hmm. So the distance for a path is sum(c_l) + sum_{edges l in path} (number of times l was in a type 2 query).

Alternatively, sum(c_l) + sum_{queries q} (number of edges in the path that are in q's list).

So the total distance is the initial sum plus the number of overlaps between the path's edges and the type 2 queries' edges.

So, for each type 1 query, we need to find the path from 1 to v where sum(c_l) + sum_{edges in path} (their update counts) is minimized.

But how can we model this efficiently?

Alternative Idea: For each edge l, track how many times it has been updated (call this delta_l). The current weight is c_l + delta_l.

So, when a type 2 query comes in, we increment delta_l for each l in the list. Then, for a type 1 query, we compute the shortest path where the edge weights are c_l + delta_l.

The problem is to compute this shortest path efficiently after each update.

But recomputing the shortest path from scratch for every type 1 query is expensive. However, if the number of type 1 queries is manageable, maybe this is feasible.

Wait, the problem allows for up to 2000 queries in total. If some of them are type 1, then each type 1 requires a Dijkstra run. For example, if there are 2000 type 1 queries, that's 2000 Dijkstra runs. Which, as before, is 3.6e9 operations. Not feasible in Python.

Alternative approach: Since the edge weight changes are additive, perhaps we can model the delta as part of the problem and precompute some structures.

Wait, perhaps we can model the problem with the initial edge weights and track the deltas, then compute the effect on the distances.

But I'm not sure. Let's think of it as the delta for each edge. So, the current distance to a node is the initial distance plus some function of the deltas of the edges in the path.

But how?

Another Idea: Suppose that we can precompute all possible shortest paths in the initial graph (without any updates). Then, when edges are updated, we can adjust the distances based on the delta. But this is only possible if the updates are such that the shortest paths don't change. However, adding to edge weights can change the shortest paths, so this approach isn't straightforward.

Alternatively, think of the problem as the initial graph, and each type 2 query adds a virtual 'cost' that depends on the edges used in the path. For example, if an edge l is updated k times, then each time it's used in a path, it contributes k to the path's total cost.

So the total cost of a path is sum(c_l) + sum(updates for each edge l in the path).

But how can we model this sum of updates for the edges in the path? Each update is a query that adds 1 to certain edges. So for each edge l, the number of updates it has been part of is delta_l. The sum over all edges in the path of delta_l is the number of times any edge in the path was updated.

So, the problem reduces to finding the path from 1 to v that has the minimum (sum(c_l) + sum(delta_l for l in path)).

But sum(c_l) is the initial weight of the path, and sum(delta_l) is the total number of times edges in the path were modified. So the total weight is sum(c_l + delta_l) as before.

So the question is, how to compute the shortest path considering the current delta_l for each edge.

But each time a type 2 query comes in, it adds 1 to delta_l for a certain set of edges.

The challenge is to compute the shortest path from 1 to v efficiently after each type 2 query, given that the edge weights are changing in this additive way.

Hmm. Let's think of the problem as having two components: the initial edge weights (c_l) and the delta_l for each edge. So the effective weight is c_l + delta_l.

Each delta_l starts at 0 and is increased by 1 each time the edge is included in a type 2 query.

Now, the problem is that delta_l can be up to the number of type 2 queries, which is up to 2000. But each type 2 query can add up to 1e6 edges (since the total across all queries is 1e6), so delta_l can be up to 2000 for any edge.

But how to manage this? Let's see.

We need a way to track for each edge l, the number of times it has been included in type 2 queries (delta_l). Then, for each type 1 query, compute the shortest path from 1 to v with edge weights c_l + delta_l.

But the problem is to compute these shortest paths efficiently.

So, here's the plan:

1. Maintain an array delta, where delta[l] is the number of times edge l has been included in type 2 queries. Initially, delta[l] = 0 for all l.

2. For each type 2 query, increment delta[l] for each l in the list.

3. For each type 1 query, run Dijkstra's algorithm where the weight of edge l is c_l + delta[l], and return the shortest distance to v.

But the problem is that for each type 1 query, running Dijkstra's is O(M + N log N), which is expensive if done multiple times. However, considering that q is up to 2000, and each query can be a type 1, then 2000 * (M + N log N) operations may be feasible if M is 1e5. Let's calculate:

For each Dijkstra's run:

- For each edge, we process it once (relaxation). So O(M) operations.

- The priority queue has O(N) entries, each with O(log N) time per insertion and extraction.

So for M=1e5, each Dijkstra's run would be about 1e5 operations for edges, plus 1e5 log 1e5 steps for the priority queue. But in Python, with the heapq module, the actual time is a bit worse.

But given that q is 2000, and each run takes about 0.1 seconds (optimistic estimate), then 2000 runs would take 200 seconds, which is way over the 10-second time limit.

So this approach is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Find a way to represent the problem such that the Dijkstra's algorithm can be optimized by considering the fact that the deltas are added incrementally. But I'm not sure how.

Wait, perhaps the key observation is that the deltas are non-decreasing. Each time a type 2 query is processed, some deltas increase by 1. So the edge weights are non-decreasing over time. Since edge weights can only increase, the shortest path distances can only increase or stay the same. Because if all edge weights are non-decreasing, any path's total weight is non-decreasing. Therefore, the shortest path distance from 1 to v is also non-decreasing over time.

This is a crucial insight. Because once this is established, we can manage the Dijkstra's runs in a way that allows us to reuse previous computations.

But wait, even if edge weights are increasing, the shortest path could switch to a different path that wasn't considered before. For example, if path A's total increases by some amount, and path B's total increases by a different amount, the minimum could switch between them.

Wait, no. If all edges' weights are non-decreasing, then all paths' total weights are non-decreasing. So the overall shortest path can only increase. Because any path's cost is now higher than before. So the shortest path can't get any shorter than it was previously. But could it stay the same? Yes, if the shortest path didn't use any edges that were updated.

But when we process a type 2 query, the edges in that query have their weight increased. So any path that uses those edges will now have a higher cost. So the previous shortest path (which might have used some of those edges) now has a higher cost, but there might be another path that was not affected (didn't use any of the updated edges) and thus remains the same. So in that case, the overall shortest path distance could remain the same or increase.

But since all paths' costs are non-decreasing, the minimal distance can't decrease. So once we compute the shortest path for a particular state of delta, any subsequent delta increases can only make the minimal distance larger or equal.

Hmm. How can this help us? Well, perhaps we can maintain the current shortest distances and, upon a type 2 query, efficiently update the distances based on the edges that were modified. But I'm not sure how.

Alternatively, since the distances are non-decreasing, perhaps after processing each type 2 query, we can run a modified Dijkstra that takes into account the edges that were updated and propagates the changes.

This brings us to the concept of dynamic shortest paths with non-decreasing edge weights. There's an algorithm called the Ramalingam and Reps algorithm which handles dynamic updates for edge increases and can efficiently update the shortest paths. But implementing this in Python might be challenging due to time constraints.

Alternatively, since after each type 2 query, some edges' weights increase, and we need to find the new shortest paths, perhaps we can use a modified version of the Dijkstra algorithm that starts with the previous distances and only updates nodes where the path can be improved (but in this case, since edge weights are increased, the distances can't be improved, so perhaps the only thing that can happen is that some paths become longer).

Wait, but after a type 2 query, some edges are increased. This may invalidate some of the existing shortest paths. For example, suppose the shortest path from 1 to v was through edge l. If l's weight increases by 1, the new distance via l is previous distance +1. But maybe there's another path that was longer before but is now shorter. Wait, no. Because all edge weights are increased, the other path's total is the same as before. So if the other path's total was higher than the original path's (original path's total + 1), then the new shortest distance is the minimum of the original path's total +1 and the other path's total. So in this case, the other path could now be better.

Wait, no. Because if the other path's total was higher than the original path's total, but the original path's total increased, then the new minimal distance could be the other path's total if it's less than the original path's increased total.

But this depends on the specific paths. For example, suppose path A had a total of 5, and path B had a total of 6. Then, if path A's edges are increased by 1 (so new total is 5 + k, where k is the number of edges in path A that were modified in the current type 2 query), then the new total could be 5 + 1 (if one edge in A was modified). Then, the new minimal distance is 6 (path B's total). So the minimal distance can decrease.

Wait, but this contradicts the earlier assumption that edge weight increases lead to non-decreasing distances. So where is the mistake here?

Ah, the mistake is in assuming that all edge weights are non-decreasing. However, in the problem, only the edges in the type 2 query are increased. Other edges remain the same. So the other paths' weights are not necessarily increasing. For example, if a type 2 query increases edge l1, then path A (which includes l1) increases in weight, but path B (which does not include l1) remains the same. So the minimal distance could switch from path A (original weight 5) to path B (original weight 6) if the increase in path A's weight makes it 6 or higher.

In this case, the minimal distance decreases from 5 to 6 (since after the update, path A is 6 and path B is 6, so the minimal is 6). Wait, but that's the same as before. No, perhaps another example:

Original path A: cost 5 (using edge l1 which is increased by 1). Path B: cost 6 (no edges modified). After the type 2 query on l1, path A's cost becomes 6, path B's cost remains 6. So the minimal distance is still 6. But if path B's cost was 5.5, then after the update, path B's cost remains 5.5, and becomes the new minimal. So the minimal distance can decrease.

Wait, this is a problem. So the previous assumption that distances are non-decreasing is incorrect. Because some edges are increased, but others are not. So it's possible that the minimal distance could decrease, which invalidates any approach based on the idea that the distances are only increasing.

Therefore, this line of thinking is not helpful. So back to the drawing board.

Alternative Idea: Since the updates are additive and the edge weights are only being increased, perhaps we can model the current delta for each edge and precompute the shortest path tree, and then adjust the distances based on the delta for each edge in the path. But how?

Alternatively, precompute the shortest path tree for the initial graph (without any updates) and track for each node the edges in the shortest path. Then, whenever an edge in the shortest path to a node is updated, the distance for that node and possibly others need to be recomputed. But this approach would require maintaining which edges are in the shortest paths, which is not feasible for large graphs.

Another Idea: Since type 2 queries can be up to 2000 and each type 1 query can be answered by a Dijkstra run, but with the problem constraints, perhaps in practice, the number of type 1 queries is small. For example, if most queries are type 2 and only a few are type 1, then the total number of Dijkstra runs is manageable. However, the problem statement allows for q=2000 type 1 queries, so this is not reliable.

Alternative Plan:

We need a way to answer type 1 queries efficiently, perhaps by maintaining a priority queue and updating distances as edges are updated. But this is tricky.

Let's think: the current state is that each edge has a weight of c_l + delta_l. Each type 2 query increases delta_l for certain edges by 1. Type 1 queries ask for the distance to v with the current delta.

So, the problem is essentially maintaining the shortest paths in a dynamic graph where edge weights are increasing.

This is a classic problem in dynamic graph algorithms. One possible approach is to use a Dijkstra-like algorithm that can handle edge increases efficiently. However, implementing such algorithms can be complex, especially in Python.

An alternative approach is to note that edge increases can only make certain paths worse. So, if we have a shortest path tree, and an edge in the tree is increased, then the subtree rooted at that edge's destination may need to be recomputed. However, implementing this efficiently requires a dynamic shortest path algorithm, which might be challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a BFS-like approach if the edge weights are small. But in this problem, the edge weights can be up to 1e9, so that's not feasible.

Another Idea: Given that the number of type 2 queries is small (up to 2000), perhaps precompute the delta for each edge and, for each type 1 query, compute the current delta and run Dijkstra with the adjusted weights. But this is the same as the original approach and would be too slow for 2000 queries.

Wait, but perhaps the problem's time constraints are lenient enough for Python. Let's see:

In Python, a Dijkstra's algorithm using heapq can process 1e5 edges in about 0.1 seconds (but this is optimistic). For 2000 queries, that's 2000 * 0.1 = 200 seconds, which is way over the 10-second time limit. So this is not feasible.

Alternative Idea: Since the updates are additive, and each query of type 2 can be represented as a list of edges to increment, perhaps we can precompute for each edge the list of times it's been updated (i.e., delta_l), and then for each type 1 query, compute the current weights as c_l + delta_l and run a Dijkstra. But again, this is the same as before.

But perhaps there's a way to optimize the Dijkstra runs by reusing previous information. For example, if we can maintain the shortest paths in a way that allows incremental updates.

But how?

Another Idea: Use the fact that each type 2 query increments certain edges' weights. So, when processing a type 2 query, the edges' weights are increased by 1, which can only increase the distances. But as discussed earlier, this isn't necessarily the case.

Wait, no. Because only some edges are increased, other edges' weights remain the same. So a path that uses non-updated edges can have the same distance as before, which could be lower than a path that uses updated edges.

So the minimal distance can decrease. For example:

Initially, path A has cost 5 (using edge l1), path B has cost 6 (using no edges in any type 2 queries). After a type 2 query that increases l1 by 1, path A's cost becomes 6, so the minimal distance is now min(6, 6) = 6, which is higher than before (5). So in this case, the minimal distance increases.

But if there's another path B with cost 5.5 that doesn't use any updated edges, then after the update, the minimal distance would be 5.5, which is lower than the previous minimal of 5 (but that's impossible unless there was a mistake in the example). Wait, no. Because if path B existed with cost 5.5 before the update, then it would have been the minimal path. So the example is invalid.

Hmm. So the minimal distance can't decrease after a type 2 query. Because the minimal path after the query is the same as before, unless it used edges that were updated. If the minimal path didn't use any updated edges, its cost remains the same. If it did use updated edges, its cost increases, but there may be other paths that are now better.

Wait, but those other paths might have been longer before but now are shorter. For example:

Initial state:

path A (uses edge l1) cost 5.

path B (doesn't use l1) cost 6.

So the minimal distance is 5.

After a type 2 query that increments l1 by 1, path A's cost is 6.

Now, the minimal distance is min(6, 6) =6, which is higher.

Another example:

path A (uses l1) cost 6.

path B (uses l2) cost 5.

Initially, path B is the minimal distance.

If l2 is updated, path B's cost increases by 1 to 6, so the minimal distance is 6.

But in this case, path A's cost is 6, so the minimal distance is 6.

So, in all cases where edge weights are increased, the minimal distance can't decrease. Because any path's cost is either the same (if it doesn't use any updated edges) or higher (if it does). The minimal distance is the smallest of all path costs. So if the previous minimal path didn't use any updated edges, its cost remains the same, so the minimal distance remains the same. If the previous minimal path used some updated edges, its cost increases, and the new minimal distance is the minimum of the previous non-minimal paths (which haven't been increased) or the new cost of the previous minimal path.

Wait, but this implies that the minimal distance can't decrease. Because all other path costs are either the same or higher. So the minimal distance can either stay the same or increase.

This is a crucial observation. Because if the minimal distance can't decrease, then once we have a certain distance for a node v, after processing a type 2 query, the distance can't be smaller than that. So this allows us to manage the distances more efficiently.

So, how can this be leveraged?

Let's think:

When processing a type 2 query, for each edge in the query, its weight increases by 1. This can affect the distances of nodes that are reachable via paths that include this edge.

But since the minimal distance can't decrease, any previous computed distance is a lower bound for the current distance.

So, when we process a type 2 query, we can run a modified Dijkstra that only processes nodes where the current distance may have increased.

But how?

The idea is to maintain a priority queue of nodes to process, initially empty. For each edge in the type 2 query, we look at all nodes that were reachable through paths that include this edge. For each such node, we need to check if the increase in this edge's weight affects their distance.

But this is still vague.

Alternatively, consider that the type 2 query adds 1 to certain edges. The current shortest paths may or may not use these edges. For each edge l in the type 2 query, if the current shortest path tree uses l, then the distance to the node reached via l may need to be updated.

But how to track which edges are used in the current shortest paths?

This seems complex.

But here's an approach inspired by dynamic SSSP algorithms:

1. Maintain the current distance array dist[], which holds the shortest distance from 1 to each node based on the current delta_l values.

2. For each type 2 query, which increases the delta_l for edges l in the query by 1, we need to update the distances for nodes whose shortest paths use any of these edges.

3. For each edge l in the type 2 query, if l is part of the shortest path tree (i.e., it is used in the shortest path to its destination node), then increasing its weight may cause the path through l to be longer than other paths. So we need to check if the new weight of l (c_l + delta_l + 1) affects the distance to the destination node of l.

4. For each such edge l (a→b with current weight w = c_l + delta_l), after incrementing delta_l by 1, the new weight is w+1. If the shortest path to b was through this edge, then the new distance to b could be dist[a] + (w+1). If this new distance is larger than the current dist[b], then the path through l is no longer the shortest. However, there may be other paths to b that are now shorter. So the distance to b may need to be updated, and this change could propagate to other nodes.

5. To handle this, we can use a priority queue and re-examine the nodes whose distances may have increased. However, since distances can only increase or stay the same, we can process nodes in a certain order.

But implementing this requires tracking the edges used in the shortest paths, which is not feasible in practice for large graphs.

Alternatively, here's a possible approach inspired by the paper "Dynamic Shortest Paths with Negative Edge Weights in Near-linear Time" by Bernáth and Pap, but adapted to our case where all edge weight changes are increases.

But I'm not familiar with the exact algorithm, and implementing such an algorithm in Python would be challenging.

Alternative Idea: Since each type 2 query adds 1 to a subset of edges, and after each type 2 query, we need to answer type 1 queries using the current delta_l, perhaps we can precompute all possible delta_l and answer the queries offline. But this seems impossible as the queries are online.

Another Idea: Since each type 2 query adds 1 to certain edges, and there are up to 2000 such queries, perhaps the total number of edges updated is up to 1e6. For each type 1 query, we can compute the current delta for each edge and run a Dijkstra. But again, with 2000 type 1 queries, this is 2000 Dijkstra runs, which is time-consuming.

But what if we can find a way to run a faster Dijkstra by using a more efficient priority queue, like a Fibonacci heap, which has O(1) decrease-key operations. However, Python doesn't have a built-in Fibonacci heap, and implementing one would be time-consuming and may not be efficient.

Alternatively, we can use a binary heap and accept that the Dijkstra implementation is not optimal. But even that may not be fast enough.

Wait, let's think about the problem constraints again:

n and m are up to 1e5.

q is up to 2000.

Total number of edges in type 2 queries is up to 1e6.

Time limit is 10 seconds.

In Python, with a fast implementation of Dijkstra using heapq and adjacency lists, maybe each Dijkstra run can be optimized to handle 1e5 edges in around 0.5 seconds. Then, 2000 runs would take 1000 seconds, which is way over. So this approach is not feasible.

So, what's the alternative?

Another Idea: Let's note that each type 2 query increases the weights of certain edges by 1. So, the effect of a type 2 query is to add 1 to the delta_l of each edge in the query. So, the total cost of a path is the sum of (c_l + delta_l) for all edges l in the path.

But delta_l is the number of times edge l has been included in type 2 queries. So, for each type 1 query, we need to compute the minimum sum over all paths of (c_l + delta_l).

But delta_l can be represented as the sum over the type 2 queries that include edge l. So, each type 2 query is a set of edges. For a given path, the number of type 2 queries that include at least one edge in the path is the sum of delta_l for edges in the path.

But wait, no. delta_l is the number of times edge l has been in type 2 queries. So for a path, the sum of delta_l for edges in the path is exactly the number of times each edge in the path has been included in type 2 queries.

So, the total added to the path's cost is equal to the number of type 2 queries that include any of the edges in the path. But no— because each type 2 query can include multiple edges in the path. For example, if a type 2 query includes two edges in the path, then the sum delta_l for those two edges would increase by 1 each, adding 2 to the path's total.

So the sum delta_l for edges in the path is the total number of times edges in the path were included in type 2 queries. This is different from the number of type 2 queries that include any edge in the path.

But this seems difficult to model.

Alternative Idea: We can precompute for each edge l the list of type 2 queries that include it. Then, for a path, the sum of the number of queries that include each edge in the path gives the total added to the path's cost.

But again, this is equivalent to sum delta_l for edges in the path.

So, the problem reduces to the same as before.

But how to compute this sum efficiently.

Another Idea: The sum delta_l for edges in the path is the same as the sum of the delta_l for each edge in the path, which is known once we have the current state of delta_l. So, the problem is to compute the shortest path in the graph with edge weights c_l + delta_l.

But this brings us back to the initial approach of running Dijkstra for each type 1 query.

But given the time constraints, this seems unavoidable. So perhaps we need to find a way to optimize the Dijkstra's runs as much as possible.

Optimizing Dijkstra's algorithm in Python:

- Use adjacency lists with tuples (target, weight) for each edge.

- Precompute the adjacency list with the base weights.

- For each type 1 query, compute the current weight of each edge as c_l + delta_l, and run Dijkstra's.

But storing all edges and recomputing their weights each time is expensive.

Wait, but for each type 1 query, we can generate the current weight for each edge on the fly. But with m=1e5, this is O(m) per query, which is expensive.

Alternative Idea: Precompute the initial adjacency list, and for each type 2 query, track the delta for each edge. Then, during the Dijkstra run, when processing an edge l, compute its current weight as c_l + delta_l.

But in Python, this is manageable. Because during the Dijkstra run, when we process an edge, we can compute its current weight by looking up delta[l].

So, for each type 1 query:

- Run Dijkstra's algorithm, and for each edge l in the adjacency list, the weight is c_l + delta[l].

This way, we don't need to modify the adjacency list for each query. We just need to look up delta[l] when processing each edge.

This is efficient in terms of memory because we don't need to create new adjacency lists for each query. The delta array can be maintained separately.

So, the steps are:

1. Read the graph, storing for each edge l (indexed from 1 to m) the start a, end b, base weight c.

2. Initialize a delta array of size m+1 (since edges are 1-based) with all zeros.

3. For each query:

   a. If it's type 2: for each l in the list, delta[l] += 1.

   b. If it's type 1: run Dijkstra's algorithm where the weight of edge l is c_l + delta[l], and return the distance to v.

The key optimization is that during the Dijkstra run, we compute the current weight of each edge on the fly by adding its base weight and delta.

This way, the adjacency list doesn't need to be modified between queries. Only the delta array is updated for type 2 queries.

So, the main challenge is to optimize the Dijkstra's algorithm to handle this efficiently.

In Python, using a heap-based Dijkstra's algorithm with adjacency lists:

Each edge in the adjacency list is stored as a tuple (b, c_l). Then, during Dijkstra's run, when processing the edge, the current weight is computed as c_l + delta[l].

Wait, but how to track the index l for each edge? Because each edge in the adjacency list must know its own index to look up delta[l].

Ah, right. So when we read the edges, we need to store not just the target and base weight, but also the edge index. Wait, no. Because the edges are stored in the adjacency list, but each edge's index is known when we read them. For example, the first edge is index 1, the second index 2, etc. So when building the adjacency list, for each edge l, we need to store a tuple (b, c_l, l). But wait, the original edge's index is l, which is given when we read the input. So during input processing, we can create a list edges, where edges[l] contains (a, b, c). Then, for the adjacency list, we can create for each node a list of tuples (b, c_l, l), where l is the edge index.

So when building the adjacency list:

adj[a].append( (b, c_l, l) )

Then, during Dijkstra's algorithm, for each such edge, the current weight is c_l + delta[l].

This way, during the Dijkstra's run, when processing an edge, we can look up delta[l] and compute the current weight.

Yes.

So the adjacency list needs to include the edge index for each edge. This way, during the Dijkstra run, when processing an edge, we can look up the delta for that edge and compute its current weight.

This is a crucial step.

So, the plan is:

- Read the m edges, storing them in a list where each edge has (a, b, c, index l).

- Build an adjacency list adj[a] containing tuples (b, c, l).

- For each type 1 query, run Dijkstra's algorithm using the current delta[l] values.

Now, the Dijkstra's algorithm for a type 1 query would proceed as follows:

- Initialize a distance array with infinity for all nodes except the start node (1), which is zero.

- Use a priority queue, starting with (0, 1).

- For each node popped from the queue, process each outgoing edge (b, c, l). The current weight is c + delta[l]. If the new distance to b is less than the current known distance, update it and add to the queue.

This is the standard Dijkstra's algorithm, except that the edge weight is computed dynamically.

But in Python, accessing delta[l] for each edge is O(1), so this is feasible.

The main issue is the time complexity. For each type 1 query, it's O(M log N) time. But with 2000 type 1 queries, this is 2e5 * 2000 = 2e8 operations, which might be manageable in Python if the code is optimized.

But let's think about the worst case. For each type 1 query, m=1e5 edges processed. Each edge requires a lookup in delta. In Python, this is manageable. The heapq operations are O(log N) per insertion and extraction.

But even with m=1e5 and q=2e3, it's 2e8 operations. Python can handle roughly 1e8 operations per second, so 2e8 would be 2 seconds. But with the overhead of Python's loops and heapq operations, it's likely to be much slower.

So, how to optimize this further?

One optimization is to use a faster priority queue. For example, using a heap implemented as a list and using heappop and heappush. But in Python, the heapq module is optimized, so this is the best we can do.

Another optimization is to represent the adjacency list as a list of lists, where each entry is a tuple of (b, c, l). But in Python, tuples are immutable, and accessing their elements is fast.

Additionally, since we are processing a lot of edges, using a compiled language like C++ would be much faster. But we need to write this in Python.

Alternative Idea: Precompute all the type 2 queries and handle the type 1 queries offline. But this is not possible since the queries are online and must be processed in order.

So, given the time constraints, perhaps the only feasible solution is to implement the approach described, and hope that it's fast enough. But in practice, this may not work for Python, given its speed limitations.

But let's look at the sample inputs. For example, the first sample input has 9 queries, including type 2 and type 1. The first query is a type 2, which increments edges 2. Then type 1 queries. So, each type 1 query would require a Dijkstra run. But in the sample, there are 5 type 1 queries, each requiring a Dijkstra run. For n=3 and m=2, each Dijkstra run is trivial.

But for larger inputs, this approach may not work.

Alternative Idea: Use BFS if all edge weights are zero. But the problem allows for edges with varying weights.

Hmm.

Another Idea: Precompute the shortest path once, and track the number of edges in that path. Then, each time a type 2 query is processed, if any of the edges in the precomputed path are updated, the distance increases by the number of updated edges in the path. But this only works if the shortest path doesn't change. However, the type 2 queries could cause the shortest path to change.

For example, suppose the current shortest path to v is P with sum c_l + sum delta_l. If a type 2 query adds 1 to some edges in P, the sum increases by the number of edges in P that are in the query. But there could be another path Q which wasn't the shortest before, but after the update, it's now shorter than P's new sum.

So this approach would not work.

Alternative Idea: The only way to handle this problem efficiently in Python is to use the initial approach of running Dijkstra's algorithm for each type 1 query, but optimize the code as much as possible.

So, let's proceed with this approach and see if we can optimize the code.

Steps to write the code:

1. Read n, m, q.

2. Read m edges. For each edge l (1-based), store a, b, c. Build the adjacency list adj[a].append( (b, c, l) ).

3. Initialize delta as a list of zeros of size m+1 (since edges are 1-based).

4. Process each of the q queries:

   a. For type 2 query: read c and the l1, l2, ..., lc edges. For each l in these edges, increment delta[l] by 1.

   b. For type 1 query: read v. Run Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path from 1 to v using edge weights c + delta[l]. Output the result.

Now, the code for Dijkstra's algorithm must be optimized for speed.

In Python, using a priority queue (heapq) and a distance array that is reused for each Dijkstra run. However, since each query requires a fresh run (the delta array changes), the distance array must be reinitialized each time.

But initializing a list of size 1e5 to infinity each time is O(n), which for n=1e5 and q=2000 is 2e8 operations. Which is way too slow.

Wait, this is a problem. For each type 1 query, we need to reset the distance array to infinity for all nodes except the start (node 1). For n=1e5, this is 1e5 operations per query. For 2000 queries, this is 2e8 operations. This is very slow.

So this is a critical issue. How can we avoid resetting the distance array each time?

Alternative Idea: Use a distance list that is updated for each query, but track the current "time" or "version" for each node. This way, we can avoid resetting the distance array between queries.

For example:

- Maintain a list dist and a list visited_time, initialized to 0.

- For each query, increment a global time counter. When processing a node, we check if the visited_time for that node is equal to the current time. If not, we treat the distance as infinity.

But this approach requires checking against the current time for each node during the Dijkstra run. However, this adds overhead to each edge relaxation step.

But let's see how this would work:

Initialize dist as a list of infinity, and visited_time as a list of 0.

For each type 1 query:

   current_time += 1

   dist[1] = 0

   visited_time[1] = current_time

   heap = [(0, 1)]

   while heap is not empty:

      current_dist, u = heappop(heap)

      if u == v: break (early exit if needed)

      if visited_time[u] != current_time or current_dist > dist[u]:

          continue

      for each edge in adj[u]:

          b, c, l = edge

          new_dist = current_dist + c + delta[l]

          if visited_time[b] != current_time or new_dist < dist[b]:

              dist[b] = new_dist

              visited_time[b] = current_time

              heappush(heap, (new_dist, b))

   if visited_time[v] == current_time:

       print(dist[v])

   else:

       print(-1)

This way, for each type 1 query, we don't need to reset the distance array. Instead, we increment current_time and only update the nodes' visited_time and dist when necessary.

This approach reduces the initialization time from O(n) per query to O(1) per query, plus the overhead of checking visited_time during the Dijkstra run.

This is a significant optimization.

So, the code will maintain a dist array and visited_time array. For each query, current_time is incremented, and the start node's dist and visited_time are initialized. Then, during the Dijkstra run, nodes are processed only if their visited_time is current_time and their current_dist is up to date.

This way, the dist array doesn't need to be reset for each query. This reduces the per-query initialization cost from O(n) to O(1), which is crucial for large n.

So, the steps for each type 1 query are:

- Increment current_time.

- Set dist[1] to 0 and visited_time[1] to current_time.

- Push (0, 1) into the heap.

- Proceed with Dijkstra's algorithm, checking visited_time and updating dist and visited_time as needed.

This approach is much more efficient and is essential for handling large n.

Now, let's code this in Python, making sure to optimize as much as possible.

Another optimization: precompute the adjacency list with tuples (b, c, l) for each edge. Then, during Dijkstra's run, for each edge, retrieve the current delta[l] and compute the weight.

Also, use sys.stdin.readline for faster input reading.

In Python, using sys.stdin and split appropriately can significantly speed up input processing.

Additionally, using a priority queue and early termination when the target node is reached.

But for this problem, since each type 1 query can ask for different nodes, early termination is possible only when the popped node is the target.

So, in code:

import sys
import heapq

n, m, q = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]  # nodes are 1-based
edges = []  # edges[0] unused, edges[1..m] are the edges
for l in range(1, m+1):
    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    adj[a].append( (b, c, l) )

delta = [0]*(m+1)  # delta[0] unused

current_time = 0
dist = [0]*(n+1)
visited_time = [0]*(n+1)

for _ in range(q):
    query = sys.stdin.readline().split()
    if query[0] == '2':
        # type 2 query
        c = int(query[1])
        ls = list(map(int, query[2:2+c]))
        for l in ls:
            delta[l] += 1
    else:
        # type 1 query
        v = int(query[1])
        current_time += 1
        # Initialize for Dijkstra
        dist[1] = 0
        visited_time[1] = current_time
        heap = []
        heapq.heappush(heap, (0, 1))
        found = False
        while heap:
            current_dist, u = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if u == v:
                print(current_dist)
                found = True
                break
            if visited_time[u] != current_time or current_dist > dist[u]:
                continue
            for edge in adj[u]:
                b, c_l, l = edge
                new_dist = current_dist + c_l + delta[l]
                if visited_time[b] < current_time or new_dist < dist[b]:
                    dist[b] = new_dist
                    visited_time[b] = current_time
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (new_dist, b))
        if not found:
            print(-1)

Wait, but this code has a problem: when a node is popped from the heap, but its visited_time is not current_time or its distance is not the current_dist, we skip processing it. For other nodes, we process their edges.

But this should work correctly.

Testing the code against the sample input:

Sample Input 1:

3 2 9
1 2 0
2 3 0
2 1 2
1 3
1 2
2 1 1
1 3
1 2
2 2 1 2
1 3
1 2

The sample output is:

1
0
2
1
4
2

Let's see:

The initial edges are:

Edge 1: 1->2, weight 0

Edge 2: 2->3, weight 0

First query is type 2 with c=1 and edges 2. So delta[2] becomes 1.

Then type 1 queries for 3 and 2.

After the first type 2 query, delta is [0, 0, 1]. So the edge weights are:

Edge 1: 0+0 = 0

Edge 2:0+1=1

The path 1->2->3 has weight 0+1=1. So the first type 1 query for 3 outputs 1.

The next query is type 1 for 2. The shortest path is directly edge 1, weight 0.

Then a type 2 query adds 1 to edge 1. Now delta is [0, 1, 1]. The edges' weights are:

Edge 1: 0+1=1

Edge 2:0+1=1.

So for the next type 1 query for 3, the path 1->2->3 has weight 1+1=2. Output 2.

Another type 1 for 2: path 1->2 with weight 1.

Another type 2 query adds 1 to edges 1 and 2. Now delta[1] is 2, delta[2] is 2. Edge weights:

Edge 1: 0+2=2

Edge 2:0+2=2.

For type 1 query for 3, the path weight is 2+2=4.

Finally, after another type 2 query adding 2 edges, the delta for 1 and 2 are 3 and 3. But the last query is type 1 for 2, which uses edge 1 with weight 3, so output 3. But the sample output's last line is 2. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the sample input.

Wait the sample input's type 2 queries are:

The first query is 2 1 2: add 1 to edge 2.

Then, after the first two type 1 queries, there's a query 2 1 1 (add 1 to edge 1).

Then, after two more type 1 queries, there's 2 2 1 2 (add 1 to edges 1 and 2).

So after that, delta[1] is 2, delta[2] is 2.

Then, when querying type 1 for 3, the path is 1->2 (weight 0+1=1 (delta for edge 1 is 1 after the first type 2 query and second type 2 query adds 1 to edge 1, making delta[1] 1. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the sequence wrong.

But the code should handle this correctly.

Overall, the code seems correct, but may have some issues with the visited_time and dist arrays.

But the key optimization is using the current_time and visited_time to avoid reinitializing the distance array each time. This should save a lot of time.

Another potential optimization is to break early when the target node is popped from the heap, as once it's processed, we have the shortest distance.

So, this code should handle the problem correctly.

Now, the code needs to be tested for correctness and optimized for speed.

In terms of speed, in Python, using sys.stdin.readline and avoiding unnecessary operations is crucial. The current code uses list comprehensions for adjacency lists and minimal operations during processing.

But for large inputs, the code may still be too slow. However, given the problem constraints and the code's optimizations, this is the best approach possible.
