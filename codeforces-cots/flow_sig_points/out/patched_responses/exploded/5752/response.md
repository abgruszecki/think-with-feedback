Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The goal is to find the minimal number of elements to change in the array so that after compression (clamping between l and r), the resulting array uses no more than I bytes. And the key is to minimize the number of elements altered.

First, let's understand the problem constraints. The disk size is I bytes, each byte is 8 bits. So the total allowed bits is 8*I. The array has n elements, and each element uses k bits, where k is the ceiling of log2(K), with K being the number of distinct values after compression. So the total bits used is n * k, which must be <= 8*I. Otherwise, we need to compress.

Our task is to choose l and r such that after compression, K is as small as possible (so k is minimized) to meet the bit requirement, and the number of elements changed (those outside [l, r]) is minimized.

So how to approach this?

First, the steps might be:

1. Sort the array. Because when looking for ranges [l, r], sorted arrays can help us efficiently find the possible ranges and the required changes.

2. Preprocess the array to count the frequency of each element, possibly using a frequency map. But maybe sorting and grouping is better for sliding window approaches.

Wait, maybe sliding window over the sorted array. Since the array is sorted, a window [left, right] represents a possible range [l, r]. The number of distinct elements in this window would be the number of unique elements in that window. Then, K is the number of unique elements, which determines k. We need K such that n * ceil(log2 K) <= 8*I.

But what's the maximum allowed K for which n*ceil(log2 K) <= 8*I?

Let's compute the maximum allowed K. Let's compute the maximum possible K such that ceil(log2 K) <= (8*I)/n. Wait, but if 8*I is less than n*0? That can't be because log2(1) is 0, and K can't be 0. So first, calculate the maximum allowed k, which is the maximum bits per element allowed. Then K can be up to 2^k.

Wait, the formula for k is ceiling(log2 K). So the maximum allowed k is the maximum such that k <= (8*I)/n, and since k is ceiling(log2 K), then the maximum K allowed is 2^k.

Wait, maybe we can first compute the maximum allowed k_bits, which is the maximum possible value of ceil(log2 K) that allows n * k_bits <= 8 * I. Then, K must be <= 2^k_bits. But since K can be less than 2^k_bits, but the actual k_bits is the ceiling.

So first step: compute the maximum allowed k_bits. If the initial K (number of distinct elements in the array) already satisfies n * ceil(log2 K) <= 8*I, then we can output 0 changes.

Otherwise, we need to reduce K to some K' where ceil(log2 K') <= allowed_k, and find the K' where the minimal number of elements need to be changed.

Wait, but how do we find the minimal changes? The problem is equivalent to selecting a subset of the sorted array (a contiguous window in the sorted array) where the number of unique elements in this window is K', such that ceil(log2 K') <= allowed_k, and the number of elements not in this window is minimized (since those elements will have to be clamped to l or r, which are the ends of the window). So the minimal changes is the total elements outside the window.

Wait, no. Wait, in the window [l, r], the elements inside the window (in the original array) are left as is. Elements less than l are clamped to l, so these are the elements in the original array that are less than l. Similarly, elements greater than r are clamped to r, which are the elements in the original array greater than r.

So for a window [l, r], the number of elements to change is the number of elements in the array less than l plus the number of elements greater than r.

But since the array is sorted, once we have a window (a range in the sorted array), l is the left end of the window, and r is the right end. So all elements before the window's start index are less than l (since the array is sorted), so they have to be clamped to l. Similarly, elements after the window's end index are greater than r, so clamped to r. The elements inside the window (between start and end indices) may have duplicates, but the K is the number of unique elements in the window.

Wait, no. The K is the number of distinct elements in the array after clamping. So after clamping, the elements are either l, any elements in [l, r], or r. Wait, no. Wait, when you clamp, the elements less than l become l, elements greater than r become r, and those in between are unchanged. So the distinct values after clamping are: l, all the unique elements in the array that are in [l, r], and r. Wait, no. Suppose there are elements in the array that are exactly l or exactly r. Then, after clamping, the distinct values are the union of the elements in [l, r] (as they are), plus any elements clamped to l or r? No, because elements originally in [l, r] remain the same. So the distinct values after clamping are exactly the distinct elements in the array that are <= r and >= l, plus possibly l or r if there are elements clamped to them. Wait, no. For example, if the array has elements 1,3,5, and we choose l=2, r=4. Then the array after clamping becomes 2,3,4. The distinct values are 2,3,4. So K is 3. So the K is the number of distinct elements in the original array that are in [l, r], plus 1 if there are elements clamped to l (even if l was not in the original array), and plus 1 if there are elements clamped to r (even if r was not in the original array). Wait, no. Because clamping elements to l or r adds those values to the K. So K can be up to (number of unique elements in [l, r] in the original array) plus 1 (if there are elements clamped to l but l is not present in [l, r], same for r). Wait, no. Let's think again.

After clamping, the possible values are:

- All elements in the original array that are in [l, r] (they remain as is).

- l if there are elements in the array less than l (they are clamped to l).

- r if there are elements in the array greater than r (they are clamped to r).

But l and r might themselves be in the original array's [l, r] range. So the K after compression is:

count = number of distinct elements in the original array that are in [l, r].

if there are elements < l → add 1 (since those are clamped to l, which may or may not have been in the original array's [l, r] range).

Similarly, if there are elements > r → add 1.

Wait, no. Because if l is in the original array's [l, r] range, then clamping elements < l to l doesn't introduce a new value. For example, if l is in the original array's [l, r], then when elements are clamped to l, they just add to the existing l's count, but the distinct K remains the same as the original elements in [l, r]. But if l is not present in the original array's [l, r], then clamping elements < l to l introduces a new value.

So K is the number of distinct elements in [l, r] in the original array, plus 1 if there are elements clamped to l (i.e., if l is not in the original array's [l, r] and there are elements < l), plus 1 if there are elements clamped to r (i.e., if r is not in the original array's [l, r] and there are elements > r).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider that after clamping, the possible values are all elements in [l, r], plus l and r if there are elements clamped to them. But that's not quite accurate because if l is already present in the array's [l, r], then clamping elements < l to l doesn't add a new value. So perhaps the correct way to compute K is:

K = (number of distinct elements in [l, r]) + (1 if there are elements < l) + (1 if there are elements > r) - (if l is in [l, r] and there are elements < l: subtract 0, because l is already counted. Similarly for r).

Hmm. This seems tricky. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute K as follows:

The clamped array's distinct elements are:

- l (if there are elements < l, or l is present in the original array's [l, r]).

- r (if there are elements > r, or r is present in the original array's [l, r]).

- All distinct elements in the original array that are between l and r, inclusive.

Wait, no. For example, original array has 2,1,2,3,4,3. Choose l=2, r=3. The clamped array is 2,2,2,3,3,3. The distinct elements are 2 and 3. So K=2. Here, the original elements in [2,3] are 2 and 3. Elements < l (1) are clamped to 2. So K is 2, which is exactly the number of distinct elements in [l, r]. Because l (2) is present in the original array's [l, r], so clamping the elements < l (1) to 2 adds 2 as a value, but 2 is already in [l, r]. Similarly, elements > r (4) are clamped to 3, which is in [l, r]. So in this case, K is the number of distinct elements in [l, r] (which is 2). 

Another example: original array is [1,3,5]. Choose l=2, r=4. Clamped array becomes 2,3,4. K is 3. The original array in [2,4] has 3, but since we clamped elements <2 (1) to 2 and elements >4 (5) to 4. So the distinct elements are 2,3,4. So K is 3. Here, the original array's elements in [l, r] (3) contribute 1, but the clamping added 2 and 4.

So in this case, K is 3, which is (number of elements in [l, r] in original array) + 1 (elements clamped to l) +1 (elements clamped to r). But since l and r were not in the original array's [l, r], the clamped values are added.

But how do we model this in our code? It's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the K after clamping is equal to the number of unique elements in the original array that are in [l, r], plus 1 if there are elements clamped to l (i.e., elements < l exist), and plus 1 if there are elements clamped to r (elements > r exist), but subtract 1 if l is already present in the original array's [l, r] and there are elements clamped to l. Wait, this is getting too convoluted.

Maybe the key insight is that when we choose l and r, the K (number of distinct elements after clamping) is the number of unique elements in the original array that are in [l, r], plus whether l is outside that range (but then clamped to) and whether r is outside.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal K can be found by considering all possible windows in the sorted unique elements. Let's think: the array is sorted and we have unique elements. Let's call the unique elements list 'unique_sorted'. For example, in the first sample input, the array is [1,2,3,4]. So unique_sorted is [1,2,3,4]. Choosing l=2 and r=3. The elements in [l, r] are 2 and 3, so K=2. Then, since there are elements < l (1), they are clamped to 2. But 2 is already in the window, so K remains 2. Similarly, elements > r (4) are clamped to 3, which is in the window, so K remains 2.

Wait, so K is equal to the number of unique elements in the original array that are within [l, r]. Because any clamped elements are set to l or r, which are part of the [l, r] range. Wait, no. For example, if the window is [2,3], and the original array has 1 (clamped to 2) and 4 (clamped to 3). Then, the clamped array has elements 2,2,2,3,3,3. So the unique elements are 2 and 3. So K is 2. But the original window [2,3] already includes 2 and 3. So K is the number of unique elements in the window.

But if the window is [2,4], and the original array has elements 1,2,3,4,5. Then l=2, r=4. Clamped elements are 2,2,3,4,4. K is 3 (2,3,4). The original window [2,4] includes 2,3,4. So K is 3, which is the count of unique elements in the window. Even though elements are clamped to 2 and 4, which are in the window, so they don't add new elements.

So, the K after clamping is exactly the number of unique elements in the original array that lie within [l, r], plus 1 if there are elements clamped to l (i.e., elements < l) and l is not in the original array's [l, r], and similarly for r.

Wait, no. Because in the first case, the elements clamped to l (2) are already part of the window, so K is the number of elements in the window. So in general, the K after clamping is the number of unique elements in the original array that are in [l, r], plus the number of elements outside [l, r] that contribute new unique values (i.e., l and r if they are not in the original array's [l, r] and there are elements clamped to them). But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the K is the number of unique elements in the original array that are in [l, r], plus the number of endpoints (l or r) that are not in the original array's [l, r] but are added via clamping.

But this is getting too complicated. Perhaps another approach: when you choose l and r, the K is the number of distinct values in the array after clamping. These values are:

- All values in the array that are between l and r (unchanged).

- l (if any element is clamped to it, i.e., if there are elements < l).

- r (if any element is clamped to it, i.e., if there are elements > r).

But how to count this? For example, if the array has elements [1,3,5], and we choose l=2 and r=4. The clamped array is [2,3,4]. The distinct values are 2,3,4. So K is 3. The original elements in [2,4] is just 3. So K is 1 (from the original in [l, r]) +1 (clamped to l) +1 (clamped to r) = 3.

If the array is [2,3,5], and we choose l=2, r=3. The clamped array is [2,3,3]. K is 2. The original elements in [2,3] are 2 and 3. So K is 2. The elements clamped to r (5 →3) don't add a new value.

So, the K is the count of unique elements in the original array's [l, r], plus the count of whether l is present in the array (if there are elements < l) and whether r is present in the array (if there are elements > r).

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again. The K is the number of distinct elements in the clamped array. The clamped array consists of:

- For each element in the original array:

   if x < l → x becomes l.

   elif x > r → x becomes r.

   else x remains.

So the distinct elements are:

- all elements in the original array that are in [l, r].

- l (if any elements are clamped to l, i.e., if there are elements < l).

- r (if any elements are clamped to r, i.e., if there are elements > r).

So K is the size of the set {elements in original array ∩ [l, r]} ∪ {l if there are elements < l} ∪ {r if there are elements > r}.

So K = len(unique_in_window) + (1 if has_less else 0) + (1 if has_more else 0) - (overlaps where l is already in the window or r is already in the window).

Wait, for example:

Original array: [1,3,5], l=2, r=4.

unique_in_window is [3], len is 1.

has_less is True (elements < l: 1 → clamped to 2).

has_more is True (elements > r: 5 → clamped to 4).

But l (2) is not in the original array's [2,4] (the original array has 3 in that range), so adding l (2) adds 1. Similarly for r (4) which is not in the original array's [2,4], so adds 1. So total K is 1+1+1=3.

Another example: original array [2,3,5], l=2, r=3.

elements in window [2,3] are 2 and 3. So unique_in_window has size 2.

elements < l: none (since 2 is the lower bound). elements > r: 5 → clamped to 3. So has_more is True. So K is 2 (unique_in_window) + 0 (no elements clamped to l) + (if 3 is already in the window, then adding r (3) which is already present, so no increase. So K remains 2.

So yes, the formula is:

K = number of unique elements in the original array within [l, r] + (1 if there are elements < l and l not in the window) + (1 if there are elements > r and r not in the window).

But how to compute this efficiently?

Alternatively, let's pre-sort the array and also create a sorted list of unique elements. Then, for any window in the unique elements (since we can choose l and r from the unique elements), we can determine the K. But perhaps the optimal l and r can be chosen from the unique elements, to minimize the K. Because if there's a unique element between two others, maybe choosing the endpoints of the unique elements as the window would be better.

But the problem is that when the window is a subset of the unique elements, the K can be computed as the number of unique elements in the window plus possible additions of l and r if there are elements outside the window.

Wait, but the window is a continuous segment of the sorted unique elements. So for example, the unique elements are [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]. If we choose a window [a2, a3], then l is a2, r is a3. The elements in the array are clamped to a2 if they are less than a2, a3 if they are greater than a3. The unique elements in [a2, a3] are a2 and a3. So K is 2 plus 1 if there are elements < a2, and 1 if there are elements > a3. But if elements are clamped to a2 or a3, but a2 and a3 are in the window, then those clamped values are part of the window's unique elements, so adding them doesn't increase K.

So in this case, the K is the number of unique elements in the window plus (1 if there are elements < l and l is not in the window) → no, because l is the start of the window. So the window contains l. So in this case, elements clamped to l (if any) are added as l, which is already in the window. So K is the number of unique elements in the window plus (1 if there are elements > r and r is not in the window). Wait, no. Because r is the end of the window, which is part of the window. So elements clamped to r (if any) are added as r, which is already in the window. So K is the number of unique elements in the window plus 0 (since elements clamped to l or r are already in the window). Wait, no. Because l and r are part of the window's unique elements. So elements clamped to l or r are part of the window's values, so their presence doesn't add new unique elements. So K is exactly the number of unique elements in the window.

Wait, this can't be right. Let's take the example where the original array is [1,3,5], unique elements are [1,3,5]. If we choose l=3, r=5. Then the window is [3,5]. The elements in the array that are in [3,5] are 3 and 5. Elements < l (1) are clamped to 3. So the clamped array becomes [3,3,5]. The distinct elements are 3 and 5. So K=2, which is the number of unique elements in the window. Because the elements clamped to 3 (which is in the window) don't add a new unique value.

Another example: original array is [2,1,2,3,4,3], sorted unique is [1,2,3,4]. Choosing l=2 and r=3. The window is [2,3]. Clamped array has elements 2,2,2,3,3,3. Distinct elements 2 and 3. K=2, which is the number of unique elements in the window. Elements clamped to 2 and 3 are already part of the window, so no new values added.

So the conclusion is that when we choose a window from the unique elements, the K is exactly the number of unique elements in the window. Because any elements clamped to l or r (the endpoints of the window) are already part of the window's unique elements. So in this case, K is the size of the window (number of unique elements in the window).

But wait, if the window is [l, r], and there are elements outside of the unique elements. For example, the unique elements are [1,3,5]. Suppose we choose l=2 and r=4, which are not in the unique elements. Then l and r are not present in the unique elements, but the clamped array would include 2 (from elements <2) and 4 (from elements >4). So the K would be 2 (the clamped values 2 and 4) plus any elements in the original array that are in [2,4]. For example, if the original array has 3, then the K is 3 (2,3,4). But how can we choose l and r not present in the unique elements? Because the problem allows l and r to be any integers, not necessarily present in the original array.

But this complicates the problem. So how can we efficiently consider all possible l and r? Because it's impossible to check all possible pairs of l and r. So perhaps the optimal approach is to consider only windows of unique elements in the original array. Because choosing l and r outside of the unique elements could lead to a lower K, but perhaps the minimal changes can be achieved by taking a window of the unique elements.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal l and r are such that l and r are elements of the original array's unique elements. Because if not, then we could adjust l and r to the nearest unique elements to cover more elements, thereby reducing the number of changes required.

For example, suppose the unique elements are [1,3,5]. Choosing l=2 and r=4 would lead to K=3 (2,3,4). But if we instead choose l=3 and r=3, the K would be 1, but this might require more changes. So perhaps the minimal changes are achieved by choosing a window from the unique elements, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal changes are achieved when the window is a subset of the unique elements. Because when you choose l and r to be between unique elements, you might end up with a larger K than necessary, which could require more changes. For example, choosing a larger K than needed would mean that the allowed K is smaller, requiring a larger window, but perhaps this is not the case.

This seems complicated. Maybe the key insight is that the minimal changes are achieved when the window of unique elements is as large as possible (so K is as small as possible), but that's not necessarily true. Alternatively, to minimize the number of changes, we need to find the largest window of unique elements (in the sorted unique array) such that the size of the window (number of unique elements) allows K' such that ceil(log2 K') <= allowed_k.

Once we have the allowed_k, which is the maximum allowed bits per element (allowed_k = (8*I) // n), but wait, allowed_k is determined by the maximum allowed K such that n * ceil(log2 K) <= 8*I. So allowed_k is the maximum possible k_bits that each element can use. So allowed_k must satisfy allowed_k >= ceil(log2 K) for the chosen K.

Wait, but the allowed_k is the maximum allowed k_bits. So allowed_k is the maximum integer such that allowed_k <= (8*I) / n. Because each element uses k_bits bits, and n * k_bits <= 8*I. Since k_bits must be an integer, allowed_k is the floor of (8*I)/n. Wait, no. Because for example, if 8*I is 8 and n is 3, then allowed_k would be 2, since 3 * 2 =6 <=8. But 3*3=9>8.

Wait, allowed_k is the maximum k_bits such that k_bits * n <= 8*I. So allowed_k = floor( (8*I) / n ). But k_bits is the ceil(log2 K). So the maximum K allowed is 2^allowed_k. For example, if allowed_k is 3, then K can be up to 8. So any K <= 8 would have ceil(log2 K) <= 3.

So first, we calculate allowed_k = floor( (8*I) / n ). But wait, because the sum n * k_bits must be <= 8*I, but k_bits is ceil(log2 K). So allowed_k is the maximum possible k_bits such that k_bits <= (8*I)/n. Since allowed_k must be an integer, allowed_k is the floor of (8*I)/n. For example, if 8*I=10, n=3 → 10/3=3.333, so allowed_k=3.

But what if n is 0? No, n is >=1 per the constraints.

So once allowed_k is calculated, the maximum allowed K is 2^allowed_k. However, if allowed_k is 0, then K must be <=1. So allowed_k is computed as:

allowed_k = (8*I) // n

But wait, if 8*I is not divisible by n, then allowed_k is the integer division. For example, 8*I=7, n=3 → 7//3=2. So allowed_k=2. Then, n * allowed_k = 6 <=7.

But then, the maximum K allowed is 2^allowed_k. So K <= 2^allowed_k.

So the first step is to compute allowed_k = (8*I) // n. Then, the maximum allowed K is max_K = 2^allowed_k.

But wait, if allowed_k is 0, then max_K is 1. So K must be 1.

So the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of elements to change such that after clamping, the number of distinct elements (K') is <= max_K.

But how?

So the approach is:

1. Compute allowed_k = (8*I) // n.

   But wait, the formula for k is ceil(log2 K). So for K=1, k=0. So if allowed_k is 0, then K must be 1.

   So allowed_k is the maximum possible k_bits such that n * k_bits <= 8*I.

   So allowed_k = floor( (8*I) / n )

   So compute allowed_k = (8 * I) // n.

   Then, the maximum allowed K is 2^allowed_k.

   But wait, if K is 3 and allowed_k is 2, then ceil(log2 3) = 2. So yes, allowed.

   So if allowed_k is 2, then K can be up to 4 (since 2^2=4), but ceil(log2 4) is 2, which is allowed.

   So yes, the maximum K allowed is 2^allowed_k.

   But if allowed_k is 3, then K can be up to 8.

   So the problem is to find a range [l, r] such that the number of distinct elements in the clamped array is <= 2^allowed_k, and the number of elements changed (those outside [l, r]) is minimized.

So the steps are:

- Compute allowed_k = (8*I) // n.

   If allowed_k >= log2 (current K), where current K is the number of distinct elements in the original array, then output 0.

   Else, proceed.

But how to compute current K? We can compute it by creating a set of the array and getting its length.

So step 1:

Compute current_K = len(set(array)).

Compute allowed_k = (8*I) // n.

max_allowed_K = 2^allowed_k.

But if allowed_k is 0, then max_allowed_K is 1.

If current_K <= max_allowed_K, then output 0.

Else, we need to find a window of unique elements in the sorted array such that the window's size (number of unique elements in the window) is <= max_allowed_K. For each such window, compute the number of elements outside the window (which would have to be clamped to l or r, which are the window's endpoints). The minimal such count is the answer.

Wait, but how to compute the number of elements outside the window. For example, the array is sorted. The window is between the unique elements' indexes. So the elements outside the window are all elements less than the window's start or greater than the window's end.

Wait, but the elements in the array are sorted. So the elements less than l (the window's start) are all elements before the first occurrence of l in the sorted array. The elements greater than r (the window's end) are all elements after the last occurrence of r in the sorted array.

But the array is sorted, so for a window [unique[i], unique[j]], the number of elements < unique[i] is the count of elements in the array that are less than unique[i]. Similarly, the number of elements > unique[j] is the count of elements in the array greater than unique[j]. The sum of these two counts is the number of elements that need to be changed.

But the elements in the array may have duplicates. So the counts can be computed using binary search.

Alternatively, since the array is sorted, the count of elements less than l is the index of the first element >= l. Similarly, the count of elements greater than r is n - the index of the first element > r.

So to compute these counts efficiently, we can:

1. Sort the array and create a sorted list.

2. Create a list of the unique elements in the array, sorted. Let's call this 'unique'.

3. For each possible window [unique[left], unique[right]] in 'unique' where the window's size (right - left + 1) <= max_allowed_K, compute the number of elements in the original array that are less than unique[left], plus the number of elements greater than unique[right].

   The minimal sum of these two values is the answer.

But how to efficiently find all possible windows in 'unique' where the size (number of unique elements in the window) is <= max_allowed_K and find the one with minimal changes.

So the problem reduces to a sliding window over the 'unique' array, where the window's size is <= max_allowed_K. For each such window, compute the number of elements outside the window (elements < left or > right), and find the minimal such sum.

But since the array is sorted, the elements < left are all elements before the first occurrence of unique[left], and elements > right are all elements after the last occurrence of unique[right].

So how to compute this:

Given the sorted array 'arr' and a window [unique[left], unique[right]], the number of elements < unique[left] is the number of elements in 'arr' that are strictly less than unique[left]. Similarly, elements > unique[right] is the number of elements in 'arr' that are strictly greater than unique[right].

So to compute these counts quickly, we can use the bisect module.

For example:

count_less = bisect_left(arr, unique[left])

count_greater = len(arr) - bisect_right(arr, unique[right])

total_changes = count_less + count_greater

We need to find the window [unique[left], unique[right]] with the minimal total_changes, such that the number of unique elements in the window (right - left + 1) <= max_allowed_K.

So the steps are:

1. Sort the array and compute the unique sorted list.

2. Compute allowed_k and max_allowed_K. If current K (len(unique)) <= max_allowed_K, return 0.

3. Otherwise, we need to slide a window over the 'unique' array where the window's size (number of elements in the window) is <= max_allowed_K, and compute the total changes for each possible window. The minimal such sum is the answer.

But how to efficiently slide the window?

Since the 'unique' array is sorted, we can use a sliding window approach where we keep track of the left and right pointers. For each possible right, we adjust the left to ensure that the window size is <= max_allowed_K, and compute the minimal total changes.

Wait, but the goal is to find all possible windows in 'unique' of size <= max_allowed_K. The minimal total changes is the answer.

But to find the minimal sum, we need to check all possible windows of size exactly max_allowed_K, since larger windows would require higher K (which is not allowed), and smaller windows would allow for lower K but may have higher total changes.

Wait, no. Because the allowed K is up to max_allowed_K. So a window of size K' (<= max_allowed_K) is allowed. But larger K' (closer to max_allowed_K) would allow more elements to be within the window, possibly reducing the number of elements that need to be changed.

So the optimal window is the one that covers as many elements as possible (i.e., the largest possible window within the K' <= max_allowed_K), but this may not be the case. For example, a smaller window may have a better trade-off between the number of elements inside and outside.

But how to find the best window? The minimal total_changes is the sum of elements outside the window. So the best window is the one that covers as many elements as possible. So the largest possible window (size max_allowed_K) would include the most elements, leaving the least possible elements outside.

But this is not necessarily true. For example, if the largest window has a high number of elements outside, but a slightly smaller window has a lower sum. So we need to check all possible window sizes up to max_allowed_K.

But since the 'unique' array is sorted, perhaps the minimal total changes is achieved by a window of size exactly max_allowed_K. Because a larger window (if allowed) would have a higher K' (but K' is allowed up to max_allowed_K). So the maximum possible window size is max_allowed_K, and we should check all possible windows of size max_allowed_K to find the minimal total changes.

Alternatively, if the window size is less than max_allowed_K, it's possible that a larger window (up to max_allowed_K) could have a better (smaller) total changes. So perhaps the optimal window is of size exactly max_allowed_K.

So the approach is:

- Find all possible consecutive elements in the 'unique' array that form a window of size exactly max_allowed_K. For each such window, compute the total_changes (elements less than left or greater than right). The minimal of these is the answer.

Wait, but if max_allowed_K is larger than the number of unique elements, then this is not possible. But in that case, the problem would have already returned 0 in step 2. So after step 2, the number of unique elements in the array is > max_allowed_K. So max_allowed_K is smaller than the current K.

So in that case, the window size must be exactly max_allowed_K. Because a smaller window would allow for a lower K, but perhaps larger total changes. So to minimize the changes, we want the largest possible window (max_allowed_K elements in the 'unique' array) that covers as many elements as possible, thus requiring the least changes.

So the problem reduces to finding the minimal total changes among all windows of size max_allowed_K in the 'unique' array.

But how to handle this when the 'unique' array's length is m, and we need to find all windows of size exactly max_allowed_K in m. For each such window, compute the sum of elements less than the window's left and elements greater than the window's right.

So the code steps are:

- Sort the array and create a list of unique elements, sorted. Let's call this 'unique'.

- Compute allowed_k = (8*I) // n.

   max_allowed_K = 2^allowed_k.

   current_K = len(unique).

   if current_K <= max_allowed_K → output 0.

- else:

   required_window_size = max_allowed_K.

   Now, in the 'unique' array, find all possible windows of size required_window_size. For each window [unique[i], unique[i + required_window_size -1]], compute the number of elements in the original array that are < unique[i], plus the number of elements > unique[i + required_window_size -1]. The minimal sum is the answer.

But wait, required_window_size is max_allowed_K. But for example, if max_allowed_K is 3, and the 'unique' array has 5 elements, then there are 5 -3 +1 =3 possible windows of size 3.

So the algorithm becomes:

Initialize min_changes = infinity.

For i in 0 to len(unique) - required_window_size:

   left_val = unique[i]

   right_val = unique[i + required_window_size -1]

   count_less = number of elements in original array < left_val

   count_more = number of elements in original array > right_val

   total = count_less + count_more

   if total < min_changes → update min_changes.

Return min_changes.

But how to compute count_less and count_more efficiently?

The original array is sorted, so count_less can be found using bisect.bisect_left(sorted_arr, left_val). count_more can be found as len(sorted_arr) - bisect.bisect_right(sorted_arr, right_val).

Yes.

So steps:

1. Sort the array.

2. Create the sorted unique array.

3. Compute allowed_k and max_allowed_K.

4. Check if current_K <= max_allowed_K → output 0.

5. Else, slide a window of size max_allowed_K over the unique array, compute for each window the count_less and count_more using bisect, and track the minimal sum.

6. Return the minimal sum.

Now, let's check the sample inputs.

Sample 1:

Input:

6 1 → I=1, n=6.

allowed_k = (8*1) //6 = 1.

max_allowed_K = 2^1=2.

The array is [2,1,2,3,4,3]. Sorted array is [1,2,2,3,3,4].

unique is [1,2,3,4]. current_K is 4, which is larger than 2.

So required_window_size is 2.

The possible windows in unique are:

[1,2], [2,3], [3,4].

For each window:

- window [1,2]:

count_less = elements <1: 0 (since sorted array starts with 1).

count_more = elements >2: in sorted array, elements >2 are 3,3,4 → count is 3.

total=0+3=3.

- window [2,3]:

elements <2: in sorted array, elements <2 are 1 → count is 1.

elements >3: elements >3 are 4 → count is 1.

total=2.

- window [3,4]:

elements <3: elements 1,2,2,3,3 → count is 3 (elements 1,2,2).

elements >4: 0.

total=3+0=3.

So the minimal is 2, which matches the sample.

Sample 2:

Input:

6 2 → I=2, allowed_k = (8*2)//6 = 16//6=2.

max_allowed_K=4.

current_K is 4, which is <=4. So output 0.

Sample3:

Input:

6 1 → allowed_k= (8*1)//6=1. max_allowed_K=2.

Array is [1,1,2,2,3,3]. Sorted.

unique is [1,2,3]. current_K=3>2.

required_window_size=2.

Possible windows:

[1,2], [2,3].

For [1,2]:

elements <1 →0.

elements >2 →3,3,3 → count 3.

total=3.

For [2,3]:

elements <2 →2 (1,1).

elements >3 →0.

total=2.

So minimal is 2. Which matches the sample.

So this approach works.

Now, the code.

But first, let's handle the allowed_k=0 case. For example, if allowed_k=0, then max_allowed_K=1. So the window must be of size 1. So all elements must be clamped to a single value. The best choice is to choose the most frequent unique element. The number of changes is the total elements not equal to that element.

So in code, when allowed_k=0, required_window_size is 1. We need to choose a single unique element. For each unique element x in 'unique', the changes are the number of elements <x + elements >x. The minimal sum.

For example, unique array is [1,3,5]. For x=3, elements <3 are 1, and elements >3 are 5 → count is 2. For x=1, elements >1 are 3,5 → count is 4. For x=5, elements <5 are 1,3 → count 4. So the best is x=3, changes 2.

So the code for allowed_k=0 is to slide a window of size 1 and find the minimal sum.

But according to the code approach, when allowed_k is (8*I) //n, which for allowed_k=0, the required_window_size is 1, and the code works.

So the code handles all cases.

Now, the steps in code:

Read n and I.

Read the array.

Sort the array.

Compute the unique array.

current_K = len(unique).

allowed_k = (8 * I) // n.

max_allowed_K = 2 ** allowed_k.

If allowed_k >= 30:  # since 2^30 is over 1e9, but Python handles large exponents.

   # but wait, allowed_k is computed as (8*I)//n. So for I up to 1e8 and n up to 4e5, 8*I is up to 8e8. For n=1, allowed_k could be up to 8e8, which is way larger than the possible number of unique elements. But since current_K is <= 4e5, if allowed_k is such that max_allowed_K >= current_K, then output 0.

But in code, after allowed_k is computed, we can check if allowed_k >= log2(current_K). But current_K could be up to 4e5. So log2(4e5) is about 19. So if allowed_k >=19, then current_K is <= 2^allowed_k.

But in code, the check is current_K <= max_allowed_K.

So code:

n, I = map(int, input().split())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

arr.sort()

unique = []

prev = None

for num in arr:

    if num != prev:

        unique.append(num)

        prev = num

current_K = len(unique)

allowed_k = (8*I) // n

max_allowed_K = 1 << allowed_k if allowed_k < 30 else float('inf')

if allowed_k >= 30:

    max_allowed_K = float('inf')

if current_K <= max_allowed_K:

    print(0)

else:

    # required window size is max_allowed_K

    required_window_size = max_allowed_K

    min_changes = float('inf')

    # iterate over all possible windows of size required_window_size in unique

    # possible if len(unique) >= required_window_size

    for i in range(len(unique) - required_window_size +1):

        left = unique[i]

        right = unique[i + required_window_size -1]

        # count elements < left in original array

        count_less = bisect.bisect_left(arr, left)

        # count elements > right in original array

        count_more = len(arr) - bisect.bisect_right(arr, right)

        total = count_less + count_more

        if total < min_changes:

            min_changes = total

    print(min_changes)

But wait, when allowed_k is 0, required_window_size is 1. So the code will iterate over all elements in unique as possible single-element windows.

Which is correct.

But in the code above, when allowed_k is 0, max_allowed_K is 1. So required_window_size is 1.

Now, what about when allowed_k is 0 and max_allowed_K is 1, but the unique array has multiple elements. The code will select windows of size 1 and choose the best one.

Which is correct.

But what if the allowed_k is 0 and I is very large, like 1e8. Then allowed_k could be 1e8 *8 /n. For example, if n=1, allowed_k is 8e8. But then 2^allowed_k is way larger than any possible current_K, so the code outputs 0.

But code handles that.

But the code has a problem: when allowed_k is large enough that 2^allowed_k exceeds the possible unique elements. For example, allowed_k is 20. Then 2^20 is 1 million. If the unique elements are 500,000, then max_allowed_K is 1 million, and current_K is 500,000, which is <= max_allowed_K. So output 0.

But the code correctly handles this.

But in the code, the line:

max_allowed_K = 1 << allowed_k if allowed_k < 30 else float('inf')

is problematic. Because for allowed_k >=30, 1<<allowed_k may be a very large number. But in Python, shifting 1 by 30 gives 1073741824, which is manageable. But when allowed_k is large (like 1e5), 1<<allowed_k would be impossible to compute. So to avoid that, perhaps the code should handle allowed_k >= 30 as a case where max_allowed_K is infinity (so current_K is automatically <= max_allowed_K). Because 2^30 is 1e9+, which is larger than the possible current_K (n up to 4e5). So for allowed_k >= 30, max_allowed_K is considered as infinity, so current_K is always <= max_allowed_K, so output 0.

So the code can be adjusted as follows:

if allowed_k >= 30:

    print(0)

else:

    max_allowed_K = 1 << allowed_k

    if current_K <= max_allowed_K:

        print(0)

    else:

        # proceed as before

Because 2^30 is 1,073,741,824. So if allowed_k is 30 or more, then max_allowed_K is >= 2^30, which is larger than any possible current_K (n is up to 4e5, so the current_K can't be more than 4e5). So if allowed_k >=30, then current_K is always <= max_allowed_K. So we can output 0.

So this case is handled.

So the code should:

Compute allowed_k = (8*I) //n.

if allowed_k >=30:

   print(0)

else:

   max_allowed_K = 1 << allowed_k

   if current_K <= max_allowed_K:

      print(0)

   else:

      required_window_size = max_allowed_K

      ... compute the minimal changes.

This handles the case where allowed_k is very large, leading to a large max_allowed_K that current_K can't possibly exceed.

So the code becomes:

import bisect

n, I = map(int, input().split())

arr = list(map(int, input().split()))

arr.sort()

# Compute unique elements

unique = []

prev = None

for num in arr:

    if num != prev:

        unique.append(num)

        prev = num

current_K = len(unique)

allowed_k = (8 * I) // n

if allowed_k >= 30:

    print(0)

else:

    max_allowed_K = 1 << allowed_k  # 2^allowed_k

    if current_K <= max_allowed_K:

        print(0)

    else:

        required_window_size = max_allowed_K

        min_changes = float('inf')

        # Iterate over all possible windows of size required_window_size in unique

        # required_window_size <= current_K

        # So the number of possible windows is len(unique) - required_window_size +1

        for i in range(len(unique) - required_window_size +1):

            left_val = unique[i]

            right_val = unique[i + required_window_size -1]

            # elements < left_val in arr

            count_less = bisect.bisect_left(arr, left_val)

            # elements > right_val in arr

            count_more = len(arr) - bisect.bisect_right(arr, right_val)

            total = count_less + count_more

            if total < min_changes:

                min_changes = total

        print(min_changes)

Now, let's test this code with the samples.

Sample1:

n=6, I=1.

allowed_k = (8*1)/6 = 1.333 → floor is 1.

allowed_k=1 <30.

max_allowed_K = 2.

current_K=4>2.

required_window_size=2.

Possible windows:

i=0: left=1, right=2. count_less=0 (elements <1), count_more= elements >2: 4 → count_more= len(arr) - bisect.bisect_right(arr,2) → arr is [1,2,2,3,3,4]. bisect_right(arr,2) is 3. 6-3=3. total=0+3=3.

i=1: left=2, right=3. count_less= bisect_left(arr,2)=1 (index of first 2). count_more=6 - bisect_right(arr,3) → bisect_right(arr,3) is 5. 6-5=1. total=1+1=2.

i=2: left=3, right=4. count_less= bisect_left(arr,3) is 3 (elements before 3 are 1,2,2). count_more=6 - bisect_right(arr,4)=6-6=0. total=3+0=3.

So min_changes=2.

Sample2:

n=6, I=2.

allowed_k= (8*2)//6=16//6=2.

max_allowed_K=4.

current_K=4 →4<=4. So output 0.

Sample3:

n=6, I=1.

allowed_k=8*1//6=1.

max_allowed_K=2.

current_K=3>2.

required_window_size=2.

Possible windows:

i=0: left=1, right=2. count_less=0 (elements <1). count_more= elements>2: 3,3,3 → count_more=6 - bisect_right(arr,2). arr is [1,1,2,2,3,3]. bisect_right(2) is 4. 6-4=2. total 0+2=2.

i=1: left=2, right=3. count_less= bisect_left(arr,2)=2 (elements before first 2). count_more=6 - bisect_right(arr,3)=6-6=0. total=2+0=2.

So the minimal is 2.

Which matches the sample.

So this code works for the samples.

Now, for the edge case where allowed_k is 0.

Example: n=5, I=0.2 bytes →8*I=1.6, allowed_k=0.

max_allowed_K=1.

unique is [1,2,3,4,5]. current_K=5>1.

required_window_size=1.

So for each element in unique:

For 1: elements <1: 0. elements >1: 4. total=4.

For 2: elements <2:2 (two 1s). elements>2:3. total=5.

For 3: elements <3:2 (1,2). elements>3:2 (4,5). total=4.

For4: elements <4:4 (1,2,3,4?), wait, no. The array is sorted. Wait, unique array is [1,2,3,4,5]. For window [4], left_val=4.

elements <4: bisect_left(arr,4). If the array has elements 1,2,3,4,5. So bisect_left(4) is the index of first 4.

Assuming arr is [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5], then bisect_left(4) is 6. So count_less=6. elements>4: len(arr) - bisect_right(4) → 10-8=2. So total=6+2=8.

But the minimal would be to choose the element with the highest frequency.

So the code would choose the window that covers the element with the most occurrences, but the code is correct.

So the code should handle all cases.

Now, for the code's efficiency.

n can be up to 4e5.

Sorting the array is O(n log n), which is acceptable.

Creating the unique array is O(n).

Then, for the sliding window part:

The size of the unique array can be up to n (if all elements are distinct). But in the worst case, when required_window_size is 2^allowed_k, and allowed_k is say 20, but current_K is 1e6, then required_window_size is 2^20 which is 1 million. But current_K can be up to 4e5 (since n is up to 4e5, the unique array can't be larger than 4e5). So len(unique) - required_window_size +1 can be negative if required_window_size > len(unique). But since in the code, we have already checked that current_K > max_allowed_K, which is required_window_size, so required_window_size must be <= current_K. So len(unique) - required_window_size +1 >= 1- required_window_size +1 = 2 - required_window_size. But required_window_size is up to current_K (len(unique)). So the loop could be O(m) where m is the len(unique), which is up to 4e5. And each iteration does two binary searches on the array, which is O(log n).

So the total time complexity is O(n log n) for sorting, O(n) for unique array, and O(m * log n) for the sliding window part. Since m is up to 4e5 and log n is about 20, this is acceptable for time constraints.

Thus, this code should work efficiently.
