Okay, I need to solve this problem where I have to reverse the encryption process described. Let's understand the encryption steps first so I can figure out how to reverse them.

So the encryption process for a string s is as follows: for each divisor d of n (the length of s) in decreasing order, reverse the substring from position 1 to d. Each of these reverses is applied in order. For example, if the divisors are 10,5,2,1 (as in the first example), then the encryption applies each of those reverses in that order.

The problem is that given the encrypted string t, which is the result after all these reverses, I need to find the original string s. The key is that applying the encryption steps to s gives t, so to decrypt, I need to reverse the encryption steps.

Wait, but how do reverses work when applied in reverse order? Let's think. Suppose the encryption steps are a series of reverses in order d1, d2, ..., dk. The encryption is applying reverse(d1), then reverse(d2), etc. To get back to s from t, I need to undo these operations in reverse order. Because each reverse is its own inverse. For example, if you reverse a substring once, reversing it again will bring it back to the original.

So, the encryption steps are done in the order of divisors from largest to smallest. So to reverse the process, the decryption would apply the reverses in the reverse order of the encryption's divisors. Wait, but the encryption's divisors are processed in decreasing order. So the encryption steps are applied in the order d = n, then next highest divisor, etc., down to 1. So the encryption is a sequence of reverses in the order of the divisors sorted in decreasing order.

To decrypt, we need to apply the inverse of each operation in reverse order. Since reversing a substring is its own inverse, the decryption process would apply the reverses in the same divisors, but in the reverse order. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Suppose the encryption steps are reverse(d1), reverse(d2), ..., reverse(dk), where d1 > d2 > ... > dk. Then the encryption process is:

t = reverse(dk) ( ... (reverse(d2) ( reverse(d1) (s) )) ... )

So to get s from t, we need to apply the inverse operations in reverse order. The inverse of reverse(d) is reverse(d) again. So the decryption process would be applying reverse(dk), then reverse(dk-1), ..., reverse(d1). Because the order of operations is reversed. So the decryption steps are the same divisors, but in increasing order (since encryption is in decreasing order), but wait no. Let's think:

For example, encryption order is d1 (largest), d2 (next), etc. So the encryption steps are: step1: reverse(d1), step2: reverse(d2), ..., stepk: reverse(dk=1). So the overall effect is that after all steps, the encrypted string is t = reverse(dk) ( reverse(dk-1) ( ... reverse(d1)(s) ... )).

To get s from t, you have to undo each step in reverse order. So first undo stepk: which is reverse(dk), then undo stepk-1: reverse(dk-1), etc. But since each reverse is its own inverse, undoing stepk is applying reverse(dk) again. So the decryption process would be applying reverse(dk), reverse(dk-1), ..., reverse(d1) in that order. Because the order of operations is reversed.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose encryption steps are reverse(4), reverse(2). So the order is first reverse the first 4 characters, then reverse the first 2. To decrypt, we need to reverse those steps. So the encryption was s → reverse4 → reverse2 → t. So to get s from t, we need to reverse2 and then reverse4. So the decryption steps are reverse2 followed by reverse4.

So in the encryption, the divisors are processed in decreasing order (4, 2, 1 perhaps?), but the actual divisors depend on n. Wait, in encryption, the divisors are all divisors of n, sorted in decreasing order. So for example, n=4, the divisors are 4, 2, 1. So encryption steps would be reverse(4), reverse(2), reverse(1). But reversing the first 1 character (i.e., the first character alone) does nothing, so in practice, the 1 can be ignored. So for n=4, the divisors in decreasing order are 4, 2, 1, but when processed, the reverse(1) does nothing.

So when decrypting, the order of the divisors for the decryption steps would be the reverse of the encryption steps. Wait, no. Because the encryption steps are done in the order of the divisors sorted in decreasing order. So in encryption, the steps are d1 (largest), d2 (next), etc. So for decryption, the order of operations would be the same list of divisors but in reverse order, i.e., from smallest to largest (since the encryption order was from largest to smallest). But again, each reverse is applied to the first d characters. 

Wait, but in the first example, the encryption steps were 10,5,2,1. So the order was 10 →5 →2 →1. To decrypt, the steps would be reverse each of those operations in reverse order. So first reverse the 1 (which does nothing), then reverse 2, then reverse 5, then reverse 10. But applying those reverses in that order would transform t back into s. 

So the problem is that for the encrypted string t, which is the result of the encryption steps applied to s, the decryption steps are the same list of divisors, but processed in the reverse order. And for each divisor in that reversed order, we apply the reverse again. 

Therefore, the approach to decrypt t into s is to generate all the divisors of n in decreasing order (as in the encryption steps), then reverse that list to get the order in which to apply the reverses for decryption. Then, for each divisor d in that reversed list (i.e., in increasing order?), apply the reverse of the first d characters of the current string.

Wait, no. Let me rephrase. The encryption steps are done in the order of divisors sorted in decreasing order. To reverse that process, we need to apply the reverses in the reverse order. So if the encryption steps were [d1, d2, d3, ...], then decryption steps are [d3, d2, d1], etc. So for each divisor in the encryption order, we apply the reverse, and to undo, we apply the reverse in reverse order. Because each reverse is its own inverse.

So the encryption is a sequence of reverses in the order of divisors in decreasing order. The decryption is the same sequence of reverses, but applied in reverse order. Because each reverse cancels the effect when applied again.

So the plan is:

1. Find all divisors of n, sorted in decreasing order. Let's call this list D.

2. To decrypt t, we need to apply reverses in the reverse order of D. So for each d in reversed(D), apply reverse of the first d characters.

Wait, no. Wait, the encryption steps were applied in the order of D (D being sorted in decreasing order). So the steps are d1, d2, d3, ..., dk. So the encryption is reverse(d1) followed by reverse(d2), etc. So the decryption steps would be reverse(dk), reverse(dk-1), ..., reverse(d1). Because to undo the encryption, you need to reverse each step in reverse order. Because the encryption was applied in the order d1 then d2: so the total effect is reverse(d2) ( reverse(d1) (s) ). To undo, you first reverse(d2) again, then reverse(d1) again.

So the decryption steps are the same divisors as in encryption, but in the reverse order. So if the encryption divisors are sorted in decreasing order, then the decryption steps are sorted in increasing order (but not necessarily, because the list of divisors may not be consecutive). For example, n=6: divisors in decreasing order are 6, 3, 2, 1. So the encryption steps are reverse 6, reverse 3, reverse 2, reverse 1. The decryption steps would be reverse 1, reverse 2, reverse 3, reverse 6. 

But reversing 1 does nothing, so we can skip that. Similarly, for any d=1, the reverse has no effect. So perhaps when generating D, we can exclude 1, but the problem statement includes it. Wait, in the first example, the divisors were 10,5,2,1. So in encryption, they did the reverse(10), then reverse(5), then reverse(2), then reverse(1). But reverse(1) does nothing. So when decrypting, the first step is reverse(1) (do nothing), then reverse(2), then reverse(5), then reverse(10). 

But in the first example, the encrypted string t is "rocesfedoc". When applying the decrypt steps:

Start with t = "rocesfedoc"

First, reverse(1) does nothing. Then reverse(2) the first 2 characters. The first 2 of "ro" becomes "or". Then reverse(5) the first 5 characters. Then reverse(10) the entire string. 

Wait, let's test with the first example. The encryption steps for s="codeforces" (length 10) are:

reverse(10) → "secrofedoc" (original is codeforces → reversed 10 becomes secrofedoc?), wait maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. The problem says the substring starts at position 1 and ends at position d. Wait, in programming terms, usually strings are 0-indexed, but the problem uses 1-based indices. So for example, in the first example, the original string is "codeforces" which is 10 characters. Reversing the first 10 characters (the entire string) gives "secroF edoc" (assuming all lowercase, but exact letters may vary). Then reverse 5 (the next divisor of 10 after 10 is 5). So after reversing the first 5 characters of the current string. Let's see:

Original s: c o d e f o r c e s → wait wait, original codeforces is 'c o d e f o r c e s'? Wait no, codeforces is spelled as c o d e f o r c e s? Wait codeforces is 10 letters: 'c', 'o', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 'c', 'e', 's'.

Wait, the first example's input is "rocesfedoc", which after decryption becomes "codeforces". So the encryption steps (applied to codeforces) must result in rocesfedoc. Let's see:

Encryption steps for codeforces:

n=10, divisors of 10 in decreasing order are 10, 5, 2, 1.

Step 1: reverse first 10 characters (the whole string). codeforces reversed is 'secrofedoc' (assuming the original is codeforces). Then step 2: reverse first 5 characters. The current string is 'secrofedoc' (if the first step is codeforces reversed). The first 5 characters are s, e, c, r, o → reversed becomes o, r, c, e, s. So the string becomes 'orcse' followed by 'fedoc' → 'orcsef edoc'? Then next step is divisor 2: reverse first 2 characters. 'or' → 'ro'. So the string becomes 'rocsedoc' (not sure, but according to the example, after all steps, it's 'rocesfedoc'. Then the final step is reversing 1, which does nothing. So the encrypted string is 'rocesfedoc'. 

So to decrypt, we need to reverse the steps. The encryption steps were [10,5,2,1]. So the decryption steps are [1,2,5,10], each reversed. So for each step in that order, apply reverse. So start with t = 'rocesfedoc'.

Apply reverse(1) → no change. Then reverse(2) → first two characters 'ro' becomes 'or'. Then reverse(5) → first 5 characters of the current string. Let's see:

After reverse(2): current string is 'orcesfedoc'.

Then reverse(5): first 5 characters are o, r, c, e, s → reversed is s, e, c, r, o. So the string becomes 'secro fedoc' → 'secr ofedoc'? Wait, maybe the next part is 'fedoc' from position 6-10. So after reverse(5), the first 5 characters become 'secro', making the string 'secrofedoc'. Then reverse(10) → reverse the entire string back to 'codeforces'.

Yes, so that's the correct approach.

Thus, the decryption process is to take the list of divisors of n in decreasing order (as in the encryption steps), then reverse that list (so the order is increasing) and apply the reverse for each d in that reversed list. But wait, the list in encryption steps is [10,5,2,1], reversed list is [1,2,5,10]. So decrypt steps are to apply reverse(1), then reverse(2), reverse(5), reverse(10). 

But applying reverse(1) does nothing. So perhaps we can skip it. But according to the problem statement, in the encryption steps, even d=1 is considered. So during decryption, we must apply all steps, including d=1.

But when we reverse the list of divisors in the encryption order (which is decreasing), the decryption steps are in the reverse order of that list. So the list becomes increasing divisors? Not exactly. For example, if the encryption steps were [6,3,2,1], the reversed list would be [1,2,3,6], so decrypt steps are reverse(1), reverse(2), reverse(3), reverse(6).

But for each d in that reversed list, apply the reverse. So the process is:

current string = t.

for d in reversed_divisors:

    reverse the first d characters.

So, the algorithm for decryption is:

- Find all divisors of n in decreasing order (same order as encryption steps).

- Reverse the list of divisors to get the order for decryption steps.

- For each divisor d in this reversed list, apply reverse on the first d characters of the current string.

Thus, the problem reduces to:

1. Generate all divisors of n in decreasing order.

2. Reverse that list.

3. For each d in this reversed list, reverse the first d characters of the string.

The final string after all these steps is s.

So, the key steps are generating the divisors in the correct order and applying the reverses.

Now, how to generate the divisors in decreasing order?

For n up to 100, this can be done by checking all numbers from 1 to n, collect those that divide n, then sort in decreasing order.

Wait, but the order is from largest to smallest. So for example, n=10, the divisors are 10,5,2,1. So for the encryption steps, the order is 10,5,2,1.

Thus, generating the divisors in decreasing order:

We can iterate from n down to 1, and check if i is a divisor of n. Collect all such i.

Once we have that list, reverse it (so it becomes 1,2,5,10 for the first example), then for each d in this reversed list, apply reverse on first d characters.

Now, the problem is that the encrypted string t is given, and applying these reverses in the reversed order of the encryption steps (i.e., the decryption steps) gives the original s.

So the code steps would be:

Read n and t.

Generate divisors of n in decreasing order.

Reverse this list to get the decryption steps.

For each d in this reversed list:

    t = t[:d][::-1] + t[d:]

Wait, but in Python, strings are immutable. So each step creates a new string. For n up to 100, and the number of divisors is O(n) (worst case, for n=100, which has 9 divisors: 100,50,25,20, etc.), this is acceptable.

Thus, the code can be written as:

    decryption_order = divisors[::-1]

    s = t

    for d in decryption_order:

        s = s[:d][::-1] + s[d:]

    print(s, file=output_stream)

Let's see. The divisors of 16 in decreasing order are 16,8,4,2,1. Reversed list is [1,2,4,8,16]. Applying reverses in that order.

But let's see:

Starting with the encrypted string 'plmaetwoxesisiht', applying reverses for d=1 (no change), d=2 (reverse first 2 characters → 'lpmaetwoxesisiht'), then d=4 (reverse first 4 → 'p l m a → a m l p → so first four becomes a m l p → 'amlp...', then d=8: reverse first 8, then d=16: reverse entire string. 

But perhaps the code would correctly generate the output. Since the sample output is 'thisisexampletwo', the code's steps would reverse each step of the encryption.

Thus, the code seems correct.

Now, the code's time complexity: for each divisor in the decryption_order list, which is O(k) steps, where k is the number of divisors of n. Each step involves reversing a substring of length d, which is O(d) operations, but in Python, slicing and reversing a string is O(d) time. For n up to 100, and the maximum number of divisors being O(100) (e.g., 100 has 9 divisors), and each step being O(n) time, the total time is O(k*n) which is acceptable.

Thus, the code should work for all test cases within the time constraints.

So the code is correct, and the approach is as described.
