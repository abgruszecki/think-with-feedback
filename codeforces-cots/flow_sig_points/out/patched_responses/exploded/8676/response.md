<think>
Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So the task is to find the longest possible dynasty name based on the given list of abbreviated names. The dynasty must follow certain rules. Let me break down the problem.

First, the dynasty is a sequence of kings where each subsequent king's first character matches the previous king's last character. Also, the first king's first character must match the last king's last character. And all the kings in the dynasty must be in the order they appear in the list. So, the dynasty is a subsequence of the list that adheres to these constraints, and we need to find the maximum total length of such a dynasty's name.

Hmm. So each possible dynasty is a sequence of names from the list (in order) where each next name starts with the previous's end character. Additionally, the first name's start and last name's end must be the same. And we want the sum of the lengths of these names to be as large as possible.

The challenge is to model this efficiently given the constraints of n up to 5e5. So a brute-force approach is impossible. We need a dynamic programming approach or some way to track transitions between start and end characters.

Let me think. For each position in the list, perhaps we can track the best possible sum of lengths for sequences ending with a certain character. But also, considering whether the sequence is part of a cycle (since the first and last must form a loop). Wait, but the dynasty can consist of a single king. In that case, the start and end are the same (since the first and last are the same king), so that's allowed.

So, let's model this. Let's consider two scenarios:

1. Sequences that form a chain (not yet closed into a loop). For these, we track the start character and the end character, but need to accumulate the maximum sum.

Wait, but the dynasty's first and last must form a loop, so the entire dynasty's start and end must be the same. So the optimal solution is a sequence of names where each next starts with the previous end, and the overall start and end are the same. And among all possible such sequences, we need the one with maximum total length.

But how do we model this? Maybe we can track for each possible start and end character, the maximum possible sum for sequences that start with s and end with e. Then, when processing each name, we can update these values.

Wait, but even better, perhaps we can track for each possible end character, the maximum possible sum of a sequence that ends with that character, and whose start character is s. Then, when a new name comes in with start c and end d, for each possible s, we can see if there's a sequence that ends with c and starts with s, and then add the length of this name to form a new sequence starting with s and ending with d.

But this might be too slow. Because for each name, we might need to iterate over all possible start characters s.

Alternatively, let's think of it as a dynamic programming problem where for each character c (the end character of the current sequence), we track two things:

- The maximum sum where the start character is equal to c. This would form a valid dynasty (since start and end are the same). Let's call this closed_max[c].

- The maximum sum where the start character is s and end character is c, but s != c. We need to track these in a way that allows us to process transitions.

Wait, maybe not. Let's think again. For a dynasty to be valid, the entire sequence must start with s and end with s. So, any sequence that starts with s and ends with s can be considered a valid dynasty. So the maximum possible sum is the maximum among all possible sequences where the start and end characters are the same.

So the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum of a sequence of names (in order) where each next starts with the previous end, and the start and end of the entire sequence are the same.

But how do we model this efficiently?

Perhaps for each name in the list, when processing it, we can update a dictionary that tracks for each possible end character, the maximum possible sum of a sequence that ends with that character and starts with a particular character.

Wait, but that's complicated. Let's think of it this way: for each possible pair (s, e), we track the maximum sum of a sequence that starts with s and ends with e. Then, when processing a new name that starts with c and ends with d, and has length l, we can look for all pairs (s, c) and extend them to (s, d) with sum increased by l. Also, the name can be a sequence by itself, starting and ending with its own start and end.

But this approach would have O(26^2) possible pairs, which is manageable. Because for each name, we can process all possible transitions in O(26) time. Since 26^2 is 676, even with 5e5 names, it's 5e5 * 26 = 1.3e7 operations, which should be acceptable.

So here's the plan:

- We maintain a DP table, which is a dictionary (or a 2D array) where dp[s][e] represents the maximum sum of a sequence that starts with character s, ends with e, and follows the chain constraints (each next starts with previous end).

- For each name in the list, we process it as follows:

   a. Get the start character c (first character of the name) and end character d (last character of the name). Let the length be l.

   b. For the current name, we can form a new sequence by itself. So for the pair (c, d), we check if dp[c][d] is less than l. If yes, update it.

   c. Then, for all existing sequences that end with c (i.e., for all possible s, if there's a sequence starting with s and ending with c), adding this name would create a new sequence starting with s, ending with d, with sum dp[s][c] + l. So, for each possible s, if dp[s][c] exists, then the new possible sum for (s, d) is dp[s][c] + l. We can update dp[s][d] to be the maximum between its current value and this new value.

   d. However, since processing each name requires updating all possible s for which there's a dp[s][c], this could be done by iterating over all possible s (26 letters) and checking if dp[s][c] exists. But even that is manageable because 26 is a small number.

- After processing each name, we can check all dp[s][s] entries (sequences where start and end are the same) and keep track of the maximum sum found so far.

So the steps are:

Initialize the DP table as empty.

For each name in the list:

   Extract c (start char) and d (end char) and l (length).

   Create a temporary dictionary to hold updates for this step to avoid overwriting.

   For all possible s in the current DP's start characters where there is a sequence ending with c:

       new_sum = dp[s][c] + l

       if new_sum > tmp[s][d], update tmp[s][d] to new_sum.

   Also, the current name can be a new sequence (c, d) with sum l. So compare with existing values.

   Then, update the DP table with the tmp values, but for each (s, d), we take the maximum between the current dp[s][d] and the new value.

   Also, after updating the DP, check if any s where d == s has a sum that's a new maximum.

Wait, but how to efficiently handle the tmp updates? Because we need to first calculate all possible transitions based on the current DP state before applying them, to prevent overwriting during the same step.

So for each name:

   c is first char, d is last char, l is len.

   temp_updates is a dictionary (or a 2D array) to collect new possible values.

   For the new name alone:

       key (c, d): possible sum l. If existing dp[c][d] is less than l, then add to temp_updates.

   Then, for all possible s in the current DP's s where there is a sequence ending with c:

       new_sum = dp[s][c] + l

       if temp_updates[s][d] < new_sum, set it.

   Then, after processing all possible transitions, merge temp_updates into the main DP by taking the maximum for each (s, e) pair.

Additionally, after processing each name, check if there's a new maximum in the DP where s == e, and update the global maximum.

At the end, the global maximum is the answer. If no such sequences exist (the maximum is zero), check if any single name forms a valid dynasty (i.e., its start and end are same). If so, the maximum could be the maximum of such individual names. But wait, according to the problem statement, the dynasty can consist of a single king, which requires that the first and last character are the same. So the single king's name must have the first and last characters the same.

So during processing, whenever we process a name, if the first and last characters are the same, then the sum for that name (its length) is a candidate for the maximum. So the maximum can be the maximum between all existing closed sequences (s == e) and any such individual names.

Wait, but in the initial setup, when we process the first name, if it's a closed name (c == d), then it's a valid dynasty. So in the DP, the initial step would have a (c, d) entry with sum l, and since c == d, that's part of the closed sequences. So the code should automatically pick that up.

But what if the maximum is formed by a single name with c == d? The code would track that in the dp[c][d] (since c and d are the same), and when we check all s == e after each step, that would be considered.

So the algorithm should handle that case.

Now, let's think about the data structures. Since s and e are characters from 'a' to 'z', we can represent the DP as a 26x26 array, where each cell (s, e) holds the maximum sum for sequences starting with s and ending with e. This is more efficient than a dictionary, as accessing and updating via indices is O(1).

So the steps would be:

Initialize a 26x26 array, all elements initialized to -infinity or zero. Wait, but since sequences can have length zero (but according to the problem, names are non-empty). So perhaps we start with all zeros, but sequences are only considered if they have at least one name. Hmm, perhaps better to initialize the DP array with -infinity, and then during processing, when a new name is considered, we can set the maximum between existing and possible new values.

Wait, let's think. Initially, the DP is empty. So for each name, when we process it:

For the new name's own (c, d), we can create a new entry if it's better than existing.

Then, for all existing entries (s, c), we can create a new entry (s, d) with sum DP[s][c] + l.

So, the DP array can be represented as a 26x26 grid, where each cell (s, e) holds the maximum sum of a sequence starting with s and ending with e. Initially, all cells are -infinity (or zero?), but perhaps starting with all -infinity except for entries that can be updated as we process names.

Wait, no. Let's initialize all DP[s][e] as -infinity. Then, for the first name, c is the first character, d is the last, l is the length. Then, for the new name alone:

if DP[c][d] is less than l, then update DP[c][d] to l.

Then, for the transitions from existing sequences ending with c. But since initially there are no sequences, that part doesn't contribute.

Then, after processing the first name, we check DP[s][s] for all s, and see if any is updated. For example, if the name's c == d, then DP[c][d] is l, which would contribute to the maximum.

So the initial state is all -infinity. Then, for each name, we:

1. Create a temporary array (maybe a 26x26) to collect new possible updates for this step. We need to make sure that when processing transitions from existing sequences, we don't overwrite the current DP's values until all transitions are considered.

So the steps for each name would be:

   a. Get c (first char), d (last char), l (length).

   b. Initialize a temporary array (temp_dp) as a copy of the current DP. Wait, no. Because the temp_dp should accumulate all possible updates from this name. Alternatively, create a new temporary structure to hold possible updates.

   Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is:

   For each name, process two possibilities:

   - The name forms a new sequence by itself. So for (c, d), the sum is max(DP[c][d], l).

   - All existing sequences that end with c can be extended by this name. For each s in 0..25, if DP[s][c] is not -infinity, then the new sum for (s, d) is DP[s][c] + l, which may be better than the current DP[s][d].

   But during processing, we cannot modify the DP while we are still reading from it. So the standard approach is to first collect all the updates in a temporary structure and then merge them into the DP.

So for each name:

   Create a temporary array (temp_updates) which will hold the new possible values for this step.

   Initialize temp_updates as a copy of the DP. No, perhaps not. Because the temp_updates is for the new transitions that this name introduces. Alternatively, for each possible (s, e) pair, the new possible value could be either:

   a. The maximum between the current DP[s][e] and the new possible value from adding this name to existing sequences ending with c, or the name alone.

   So perhaps:

   For each possible (s, e) in the DP:

       temp_updates[s][e] = DP[s][e]

   Then, process:

   For the current name's own (c, d):

       if temp_updates[c][d] < l:
           temp_updates[c][d] = l

   Then, for all possible s in 0..25:

       if DP[s][c] is not -infinity:

           new_sum = DP[s][c] + l

           if new_sum > temp_updates[s][d]:
               temp_updates[s][d] = new_sum

   Then, after processing all s, merge temp_updates into the DP by taking the maximum for each (s, e) pair.

Wait, no. Because the temp_updates is not just the sum of the current name. We need to consider all possible transitions and update the DP accordingly. Alternatively, during the processing of the name, for each possible s, we can compute the new possible sum for (s, d) and compare it to the existing DP and the temp_updates.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is:

Initialize a temporary array for the new possible DP values. For each (s, e), the new possible value is the maximum between:

   - the current DP[s][e] (carrying over existing values)

   - the new possible values generated by this name.

The new possible values are:

   1. The name by itself: (c, d) with sum l.

   2. For all s where there is a sequence ending with c (DP[s][c] is not -infinity), then adding this name gives a new sequence (s, d) with sum DP[s][c] + l.

So, for each (s, e) in the DP:

   new_value = DP[s][e]

   if e == d:

       # Check if adding this name via transitions from s where c is the end
       for possible_s in all s:
           if DP[possible_s][c] + l > new_value:
               new_value = max(new_value, DP[possible_s][c] + l)

       # Also check if the name alone is better
       if s == c and e == d and l > new_value:
           new_value = l

   Wait, no. This seems complicated.

Maybe the better way is:

For each name (c, d, l):

   Create a temporary 26x26 array that starts as the current DP.

   Then, process two possibilities:

   a. The name can form a new sequence (c, d) with sum l. So, if the temporary's [c][d] is less than l, update it to l.

   b. For all s in 0..25, check if DP[s][c] is not -infinity. If so, then the new sequence (s, d) can have sum DP[s][c] + l. Compare this to the temporary's [s][d] and update if necessary.

Wait, but in this case, we need to first compute the new possible values based on the original DP, not the temporary array. Because the temporary array is a copy of the original DP, and we apply both possibilities a and b to it.

Wait, maybe the steps are:

   For each name:

       new_dp is a copy of the current DP.

       # Update new_dp for the case where the name is added to existing sequences ending with c.

       for s in 0..25:

           if DP[s][c] != -infinity:

               possible_sum = DP[s][c] + l

               if possible_sum > new_dp[s][d]:

                   new_dp[s][d] = possible_sum

       # Update new_dp for the case where the name is a standalone sequence.

       if l > new_dp[c][d]:

           new_dp[c][d] = l

       # Then, the DP becomes the new_dp.

       DP = new_dp

But this approach is incorrect because when processing multiple s values, the updates might overwrite each other. Wait, no. Because in this approach, the new_dp is a copy of the original DP. Then, for each s, we check the original DP's [s][c] and add the possible_sum to new_dp's [s][d]. So all the s's are considered based on the original DP, which is correct.

But creating a copy of a 26x26 array for each of 5e5 names would take O(5e5 * 26*26) operations, which is about 3.38e7 operations. That's manageable.

Wait, but how to efficiently make a copy of the DP array? In Python, if we have a list of lists, making a deep copy each time would be expensive. Wait, but 26x26 is small. So for each name, create a new 26x26 array that is a copy of the previous DP. Then, apply the two steps (adding transitions and adding the standalone name). Then, set DP to this new array.

But in Python, for a 26x26 array, making a deep copy can be done with something like [row.copy() for row in DP], but for 5e5 steps, that's 5e5 * 26 * 26 = 3.38e7 operations. Which is acceptable.

Alternatively, since the updates are additive and based on the original DP, perhaps we can avoid making a full copy and instead compute the new_dp as the max between existing DP and the possible transitions.

Wait, perhaps:

We can create a new_dp array initialized as the same as the current DP.

Then, for each s in 0..25:

   if DP[s][c] is not -infinity:

       possible_sum = DP[s][c] + l

       if possible_sum > new_dp[s][d]:

           new_dp[s][d] = possible_sum

Then, check if the current name's own (c, d) is better than existing in new_dp.

So, for the name itself:

if l > new_dp[c][d]:

   new_dp[c][d] = l

Then, set DP = new_dp.

But how do we create new_dp as a copy of the current DP?

In Python, for a list of lists:

new_dp = [row.copy() for row in DP]

This is manageable for 26x26.

So the code would look something like:

Initialize dp as a 26x26 array filled with -infinity.

max_len = 0

for each name in the list:

   c = first character, converted to 0-25

   d = last character, converted to 0-25

   l = length of the name

   # Create a new_dp array as a copy of the current dp

   new_dp = [row.copy() for row in dp]

   # Update transitions from existing sequences ending with c

   for s in range(26):

       if dp[s][c] != -infinity:

           if (dp[s][c] + l) > new_dp[s][d]:

               new_dp[s][d] = dp[s][c] + l

   # Update the standalone name

   if l > new_dp[c][d]:

       new_dp[c][d] = l

   # Update the current dp to new_dp

   dp = new_dp

   # Update max_len by checking all s where start and end are the same

   current_max = max(dp[s][s] for s in range(26))

   if current_max > max_len:

       max_len = current_max

But wait, this approach would have a problem: after each name, we create a new copy of the entire DP array. For 5e5 names, each copy is 26x26, which is 676 elements. So 5e5 * 676 = 3.38e8 operations. Which is acceptable? Well, in Python, list comprehensions are fast, but creating a list of 26 lists, each with 26 elements, for 5e5 times, might be manageable. But perhaps there's a more efficient way.

Alternative approach: instead of making a copy each time, use two separate DP arrays and alternate between them. For example, use a previous_dp and current_dp. For each step, current_dp is initialized as previous_dp's values. Then, during processing, we update current_dp based on the previous_dp. This way, we avoid copying the entire array each time.

But how to implement this. Let's see:

We can have two 26x26 arrays: prev_dp and curr_dp.

For each name:

   c, d, l = ...

   # Initialize curr_dp as a copy of prev_dp.

   for s in 0..25:

       curr_dp[s] = prev_dp[s].copy()

   # Then, process transitions:

   for s in 0..25:

       if prev_dp[s][c] != -infinity:

           sum_val = prev_dp[s][c] + l

           if sum_val > curr_dp[s][d]:

               curr_dp[s][d] = sum_val

   # Update the standalone case:

   if l > curr_dp[c][d]:

       curr_dp[c][d] = l

   # Then, check max_len:

   current_max = max(curr_dp[s][s] for s in 0..25)

   if current_max > max_len:

       max_len = current_max

   # Swap prev_dp and curr_dp for the next iteration.

   prev_dp, curr_dp = curr_dp, prev_dp

Wait, but in Python, how to efficiently copy the rows. For each of the 26 rows, we can make a copy. So for s in 0..25, curr_dp[s] = list(prev_dp[s]). This would create a deep copy of each row.

But for each name, this is 26 * 26 operations. 5e5 * 26*26 = 3.38e8 operations. Which is acceptable, but perhaps in Python, this is a bit slow for the time constraints.

Another optimization: since each name's processing only depends on the previous state, perhaps we can avoid copying the entire DP and instead compute the new values based on the previous state.

Wait, perhaps the transitions can be computed in a way that the current name's processing is based solely on the previous DP. So for each (s, e) in the new_dp, the value is the maximum between:

   a. The previous DP[s][e]

   b. The new possible value from adding the current name to a sequence ending with c (i.e., previous DP[s'][c] + l, where s' = s).

   c. The new possible value of the current name alone (if s is c and e is d, then l).

Wait, but this approach is not straightforward. Let's think again.

The new_dp for a name can be built as:

For each (s, e) in new_dp:

   new_dp[s][e] = max(prev_dp[s][e], ... )

The ... comes from two possibilities:

1. Adding the current name to a sequence that ended with c, leading to e = d and s remains s.

   For all s, if there was a prev_dp[s][c], then new_dp[s][d] can be updated to max(prev_dp[s][d], prev_dp[s][c] + l).

2. The name alone: new_dp[c][d] = max(prev_dp[c][d], l).

So the new_dp is computed as:

new_dp = [row.copy() for row in prev_dp]

for s in range(26):

   if prev_dp[s][c] != -infinity:

       new_sum = prev_dp[s][c] + l

       if new_sum > new_dp[s][d]:

           new_dp[s][d] = new_sum

if l > new_dp[c][d]:

   new_dp[c][d] = l

So in this case, the new_dp is a copy of the previous_dp, and then modified for possible transitions and the standalone case.

But making a copy of the previous_dp for each name is expensive. So perhaps we can pre-initialize new_dp as the same as prev_dp, but only update the necessary cells.

Wait, but in Python, for each name, how much time does it take to copy the 26x26 array. Let's think: 26 rows, each being a list of 26 elements. So for each name, 26 * 26 = 676 elements copied. For 5e5 names, that's 5e5 * 676 = 3.38e8 operations. In Python, each list copy is O(n), so this might be feasible, but perhaps it's better to find a way to avoid copying.

Alternative approach: for each name, compute the new possible values and track the maximum possible sum for each (s, e) pair.

But maybe the code can be written with the first approach, and in practice, it's fast enough.

Let me proceed with the code structure:

Initialize the DP as a 26x26 array filled with -infinity.

max_len = 0

for each name in the list:

   c = ord(first_char) - ord('a')

   d = ord(last_char) - ord('a')

   l = len(name)

   # Create a copy of the current DP into new_dp

   new_dp = [row.copy() for row in dp]

   # Update new_dp based on transitions from sequences ending with c

   for s in range(26):

       if dp[s][c] != -infinity:

           possible_sum = dp[s][c] + l

           if possible_sum > new_dp[s][d]:

               new_dp[s][d] = possible_sum

   # Update new_dp with the standalone case

   if l > new_dp[c][d]:

       new_dp[c][d] = l

   # Update the current DP to new_dp

   dp = new_dp

   # Check for closed sequences (s == e)

   current_max = max(dp[s][s] for s in range(26))

   if current_max > max_len:

       max_len = current_max

After processing all names, output max_len if it's >=0, else 0.

But wait, the initial state is all -infinity. So after the first name, if it's a closed sequence (c == d), then new_dp[c][d] = l (if l is larger than previous, which was -inf). Then, the current_max would be l. So that's correct.

But in the problem statement, even if all possible dynasties are invalid (like sequences that can't form a closed loop), the answer is 0. So we need to return 0 if there's no valid dynasty.

Wait, no. The note says that a dynasty can consist of a single king. So if a single king's first and last characters are the same, that's a valid dynasty. So if even one such exists, the maximum can't be zero. But in the sample input 3:

3

ab

c

def

The output is 1, which is the 'c' in the second position. Because 'c' has first and last character 'c', so it's a valid dynasty of length 1.

So the code's approach of tracking the maximum of dp[s][s] after each step should capture this.

But what if all names have first and last characters different, and no possible sequences can form a closed loop? Then the maximum would be 0.

But in the code, the initial DP is all -infinity. So for the first name that is not closed (c != d), the new_dp[c][d] is set to l, but the current_max would be max of all dp[s][s], which are all -inf except possibly some. So the current_max would remain 0 only if no closed sequences are possible.

Wait, no. Because in the code, the initial DP is all -infinity. Then, when processing the first name, new_dp is a copy of the initial DP (all -inf), but then for transitions and the standalone case.

Suppose the first name is 'ab' (c=0, d=1, l=2). Then, after processing:

new_dp[0][1] = max(-inf, 2) → 2.

current_max is the max of dp[s][s], which are all -inf except perhaps if any s has dp[s][s] updated. But in this case, only (0,1) is updated. So current_max is -inf. But the code's 'max' function over all s would return -inf. So how to handle this.

Wait, in Python, the max of an iterable with all elements as -inf is -inf. So the code's current_max would be -inf. So the max_len remains 0. But according to the problem statement, if there are no dynasties (like no sequences that can form a closed loop), the answer is 0.

So in the code, after processing all names, the max_len can be -inf (if no closed sequences are found) or some positive number. But in such cases, we need to output 0.

Wait, but the code initializes max_len as 0, and after each name, checks if current_max (which is the max of dp[s][s]) is greater than max_len. But dp[s][s] could be -inf (if no closed sequences). So if after all names, all dp[s][s] are -inf, then the max_len would remain 0.

But what about names that are valid as single-king dynasties (c == d)?

For example, the third sample input: the second name is 'c', which starts and ends with 'c'. So when processing that name:

c = 2, d = 2, l=1.

The new_dp[2][2] is set to 1. So current_max is 1, which is greater than the initial max_len of 0, so max_len becomes 1.

So the code's approach would capture that.

But the code's initial DP is all -inf. So after processing that name, the new_dp[2][2] is 1, and the current_max is 1. So the code correctly sets max_len to 1.

But if no names have c == d, then the code would output 0.

So the code's final output would be the max between 0 and the maximum dp[s][s] across all steps.

Wait, no. Because in the code, the initial max_len is 0, and during each step, the current_max is the maximum of dp[s][s], which could be -inf. So after all steps, if the max_len is still 0, but there were no valid dynasties (all dp[s][s] are -inf), then the code outputs 0, which is correct.

Wait, but if all dp[s][s] are -inf, then current_max is -inf. So during each step, if current_max is -inf, it's not greater than max_len (0), so max_len remains 0. Thus, the code would output 0, which is correct.

So the code should be correct.

Now, let's test the sample inputs.

Sample Input 1:

3

abc → starts with 'a' (0), ends with 'c' (2), l=3.

ca → starts with 'c' (2), ends with 'a' (0), l=2.

cba → starts with 'c' (2), ends with 'a' (0), l=3.

Processing the first name:

After processing 'abc', new_dp[0][2] = 3.

current_max is max of dp[s][s] → all -inf, except none, so current_max is -inf. So max_len remains 0.

Processing the second name: 'ca' (c=2, d=0, l=2).

Transitions: look for s where prev_dp[s][2] (prev_dp is the DP after first name, which is all -inf except (0,2) =3. So for s=0: prev_dp[0][2] is 3. So adding this name, possible_sum is 3+2=5. So new_dp[0][0] =5.

Also, the standalone name 'ca' (c=2, d=0) → new_dp[2][0] is set to 2.

So after processing, new_dp has (0,0) as 5, (2,0) as 2.

current_max is max of dp[s][s] → 5 (from s=0). So max_len becomes 5.

Third name: 'cba' (c=2, d=0, l=3).

Transitions: look for s where prev_dp[s][2] (prev_dp is after second step). prev_dp has (0,0)=5, (0,2) is 3 (from first step?), or what? Wait, after second step, the DP is new_dp after processing the second name. Let's think:

After processing the second name, the DP has:

new_dp[0][0] =5 (from adding 'ca' to the first 'abc' → 3+2=5, which creates a sequence starting with 0 and ending with 0).

new_dp[2][0] =2 (standalone 'ca').

Other entries are -inf.

Now, processing the third name (c=2, d=0, l=3):

For transitions: look for s where prev_dp[s][c=2] is not -inf.

prev_dp is the DP after second step. So prev_dp[s][2] for any s is -inf, except s=0 where prev_dp[0][2] is 3 (from first step, but after second step, the DP is new_dp which includes transitions from the second name. Wait no: after the first name, DP is new_dp after first step (0,2)=3. Then, processing the second name, 'ca' (c=2, d=0, l=2). So during that step, for transitions, for each s in 0..25, check if prev_dp[s][c=2] is not -inf. In the prev_dp (after first step), s=0 has prev_dp[0][2] =3. So for s=0, possible_sum =3 +2=5. So new_dp[0][0] is set to 5. Then, the standalone name 'ca' is (2,0) → set to 2.

So after second step, new_dp is:

- (0,0):5

- (2,0):2

- (0,2):3 (from first step, not modified in second step, since the transitions are only adding to (0,0) and (2,0).)

Wait, no. Because during the second step's processing:

The new_dp starts as a copy of the previous DP (after first step), which includes (0,2)=3 and others as -inf. Then, for s in 0..25:

If prev_dp[s][c=2] (c=2 for the second name) is not -inf. So s=0: prev_dp[0][2] =3 → possible_sum =3 +2=5. So new_dp[0][0] (d=0) is updated to 5. Also, standalone name (c=2, d=0) → new_dp[2][0] is set to 2. So after second step, the DP is:

s=0:

e=0:5

e=2:3 (from first step, since new_dp is a copy of previous DP)

others: -inf

s=2:

e=0:2

others: -inf

Other s's: all -inf.

Now, processing the third name (c=2, d=0, l=3).

The transitions are:

For each s in 0..25, if prev_dp (after second step) [s][2] is not -inf.

Looking at the prev_dp after second step:

s=0 has e=2 →3.

Other s's have e=2 as -inf.

So for s=0, prev_dp[0][2] =3. possible_sum =3 +3=6. So new_dp[0][0] is max(5, 6) →6.

Also, standalone case: c=2, d=0 → new_dp[2][0] is max(2,3) →3.

So after processing the third name, the DP has:

s=0:

e=0:6 (from transition)

e=2:3 (from previous steps)

s=2:

e=0:3 (from standalone)

others: -inf.

Then, the current_max is the max of dp[s][s], which is 6 (s=0).

So the code would set max_len to 6, which matches the sample.

So the code works for the first sample.

Sample Input 3:

3

ab → c=0, d=1, l=2.

c → c=2, d=2, l=1.

def → c=3, d=5, l=3.

Processing the first name: new_dp[0][1] =2. current_max is -inf. max_len remains 0.

Processing the second name:

c=2, d=2, l=1.

Transitions: look for s where prev_dp[s][2] is not -inf. prev_dp after first step has (0,1)=2. So no s has prev_dp[s][2] != -inf. So transitions don't add anything. Then, standalone case: new_dp[2][2] is set to 1. current_max is max of dp[s][s] →1. So max_len becomes 1.

Third name: processed, but no impact on the max_len. So the output is 1.

So the code works.

Now, the code's time and memory complexity:

Time:

Each of the 5e5 names is processed in O(26) time (for the loop over s in 0..25). Because for each name, we loop through 26 possible s values. Then, copying the DP array (26x26) for each name. So total time is O(n * 26 + n * 26^2) → O(n * 26^2) → 5e5 * 676 → 3.38e8 operations. Which is acceptable for Python in 2 seconds.

Memory:

The DP arrays are 26x26 each. So for two copies (previous and current), it's 2 * 26*26 = 1352 integers. Which is negligible.

So the code should work.

Now, let's write the code.

But in Python, how to handle the initial DP. Let's create a 26x26 array filled with -infinity.

We can initialize the DP as follows:

Sample 3:

3

ab → c=0, d=1, l=2. No closed.

c → c=2, d=2. l=1. So new_dp[2][2] =1. current_max is 1. max_len becomes 1.

def → c=3, d=5. l=3. No impact on max_len.

Output is 1.

So the code works.
