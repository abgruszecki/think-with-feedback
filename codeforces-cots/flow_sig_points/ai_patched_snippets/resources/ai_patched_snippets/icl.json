Let's see. bin(1) is '0b1', so [2:] is '1', which is correct.\n\nWhat about edge cases like n=1e6? Let's compute 1e6 in binary. Well, bin(1000000) is '0b11110100001001000000', which when sliced gives the correct binary.\n\nThis approach is O(1) time because converting an integer to binary in Python is done efficiently, even for large numbers.

The built-in functions are optimized in C, so they're much faster than any manual implementation.\n\nAnother approach would be to manually compute the binary digits by dividing n by 2 each time and collecting the remainders.
