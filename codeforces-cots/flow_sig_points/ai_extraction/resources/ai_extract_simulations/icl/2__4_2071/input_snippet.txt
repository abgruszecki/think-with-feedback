Wait, but that's possible. However, the problem statement says that the numbers can be up to 10^500. Wait, but 10^500 is a 1 followed by 500 zeros, which is 501 digits. But the constraints say 1 ≤ a, b < 10^500. Wait, the problem statement says the numbers are less than 10^500, which would have up to 500 digits. For example, 10^500 is a 501-digit number. So the input numbers can have up to 500 digits. So when a and b are read as integers, Python can handle them. Then adding and printing would work.

So why would this not work? Because in some programming languages, like C++ or Java, such large numbers can't be stored as integers, so you have to handle them as strings and perform digit-by-digit addition. But in Python, the code would work. So for the given problem, the optimal approach is to read the two numbers as integers, add them, and output the result as a string. Because Python can handle arbitrary-precision integers. That would be the simplest and fastest solution.

But wait, is there a case where this approach would fail? Like leading zeros? No, because the input is guaranteed to not have leading zeros. And the output must not have leading zeros. But when adding two numbers, the sum could have leading zeros? No, because the sum of two numbers with at least 1 (since a and b are at least 1) can't be zero. So the sum will be at least 2, so no leading zeros. Wait, but if a is 1 and b is 0, but according to the constraints, the numbers are 1 ≤ a, b < 10^500, so b can't be zero. Wait the constraints say 1 ≤ a, b < 10^500. So both a and b are at least 1. So their sum is at least 2, so when printed as a string, there's no leading zero. So the code can safely convert to integer and print the sum as a string.

So the Python code would be:
