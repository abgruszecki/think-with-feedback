<think>
Okay, let's see. We need to solve this problem where a girl wants to buy flowers for her bouquet. The constraints are that the difference in petals between any two flowers in the bouquet can't exceed one. And she has m coins, each flower costs as much as its petals. So the goal is to find the maximum total petals possible under these conditions.

Hmm. So first, the key point is that all flowers in the bouquet must have petals either k or k+1. Because if the max difference is 1, then they can be all in a group where either all are same, or some are one more. So for example, flowers can be 3,3,4: their differences are at most 1.

So the approach here is to find for each possible k, the maximum number of flowers we can take that are either k or k+1, such that the sum of their costs (which is the same as the sum of petals) is <= m. Then among all possible k, find the maximum sum.

But how do we efficiently compute this for all possible k? Because n can be up to 2e5 and each a_i up to 1e9, trying all possible k values isn't feasible unless we can do it efficiently.

Wait, here's an idea: sort the array of a_i. Then, for each possible group of consecutive elements where the max and min differ by at most 1. For example, in the sorted array, any such group can be considered. But even that might be tricky.

Alternatively, since the flowers can be of two types (k and k+1), perhaps the optimal bouquet is formed by taking all flowers that are either k or k+1, for some k. So the possible candidates are pairs of consecutive sorted a_i's where a certain k is chosen. But how do we find the best k?

Alternatively, we can think of k being any possible value, and for each k, calculate the sum of all a_i where a_i is either k or k+1, and then select the maximum sum that is <= m. But even that approach is O(n) per test case for each possible k, which is not feasible since a_i can be up to 1e9 and there are up to 2e5 n per test case.

Wait, but perhaps we can pre-sort the array, then for each possible k, find the number of flowers that are >=k and <=k+1. Then, the sum of those flowers would be the sum of a_i's in that range. But even here, how to find which k gives the maximum sum under m?

Alternatively, the optimal bouquet would consist of some of the largest possible flowers. For example, maybe take all flowers that are either x or x-1, where x is the maximum possible. Because taking larger petals gives more total.

So perhaps the optimal k is such that k is either the maximum a_i or one less. Or maybe even more, but that's a possible starting point.

Wait, but maybe not. For example, maybe there are a bunch of 2s and 3s, and some higher numbers. But maybe taking the 2s and 3s gives a sum that fits into m, whereas higher numbers are too few. So the problem is that the optimal k can be anywhere, not necessarily near the maximum a_i.

So, how to approach this?

Let me think of the steps:

1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.

2. Precompute prefix sums of the sorted array. Because when we choose a group of flowers with petals k or k+1, they might form a contiguous segment in the sorted array. Wait, not exactly. Because if the array is sorted, then any a_i that is k or k+1 must be consecutive in the array. For example, if the array is sorted, and there are elements like 2,2,3,3,4, then the group of 3 and 4 (k=3) would be a consecutive segment. Wait, no. Because 3 and 4 would have a difference of 1. So for k=3, the allowed a_i are 3 and 4. So in the sorted array, the possible a_i's would be consecutive in the array. So perhaps, the optimal k can be found by considering all possible consecutive pairs in the sorted array where the difference between adjacent elements is <=1. Hmm, maybe not. But perhaps by sorting the array, the possible k's that are worth considering are those where there's a cluster of a_i's that are within 1 of each other.

Alternatively, the optimal bouquet is made up of a contiguous segment in the sorted array where the maximum and minimum differ by at most 1. Because if you have a group that's not contiguous, perhaps there's a way to include more elements from a contiguous segment with higher a_i's.

Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, if the array is [1,1,3,3], then the group 1,1,3,3 would have a max difference of 2, which is invalid. But a group of 3 and 3 is allowed, but maybe also a group of 3 and 3 and some others. Wait, no. If the group is 3,3, then the difference is 0, which is okay. So in this case, taking the two 3's gives a sum of 6. If m is 6, that's possible.

But perhaps the optimal solution is to take the largest possible contiguous segment where the max and min differ by at most 1. Because that would give the highest sum possible.

Alternatively, maybe the optimal solution is to take a range where the maximum is x and the minimum is x or x-1, and the sum of all those elements is as large as possible without exceeding m.

But how do we efficiently find this x?

Another approach: For each possible x (could be any a_i or a_i +/-1), determine how many flowers can be taken that are either x or x-1. Then compute the sum of these flowers, but only take as many as possible, in a way that the sum is <=m, and track the maximum sum.

But how do we efficiently compute this for all possible x?

But x can be up to 1e9, so trying all possible x is not feasible.

Alternative idea: Since the array is sorted, for each possible x, the flowers that can be included are those >=x-1 and <=x. Wait, no. Because if the allowed difference is at most 1, then the flowers can be x or x+1. Wait, maybe x is the minimum in the bouquet. Then the maximum would be x+1. Or x is the maximum, then the minimum is x-1. So perhaps, for each possible x, the bouquet can have flowers in [x-1, x], or [x, x+1]. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the bouquet can consist of all flowers that are in [k, k+1]. So for any k, we can include all a_i where a_i is k or k+1. The sum of these a_i's is the sum of the group. If this sum is <= m, then the maximum possible sum is the sum of this group. But we need to find the maximum possible sum across all possible k.

But how do we find the best k?

Another thought: After sorting the array, for any possible window in the sorted array where the max is at most 1 more than the min, we can consider this window as a candidate. The sum of all elements in this window is a candidate for the maximum sum if it's <=m. Among all such possible windows, we need to find the maximum sum that is <=m. But considering all possible such windows would be O(n^2), which is not feasible.

But perhaps we can find that the optimal window is a contiguous interval in the sorted array. Because the array is sorted, any such window is a contiguous segment. So for example, a window from index i to j where a[j] - a[i] <=1. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray where the difference between the maximum and minimum in the subarray is at most 1.

Then, the sum of such a subarray is a candidate. We need to find the maximum sum among all such subarrays that is <=m, and also compare with the case where we take the entire subarray (if sum <=m), or take a subset of it (if sum is larger than m). Wait, but even if the sum of the entire subarray exceeds m, maybe taking a subset of it (like the largest elements) gives a sum that is <=m and higher than other candidates.

But how to model this.

Wait, the problem allows taking any subset of the flowers in the store. So even if the entire group of [k, k+1] flowers sum exceeds m, perhaps taking the largest possible subset of those flowers (sorted in non-decreasing order, take the largest possible) gives a sum that's as large as possible but <=m.

So the approach would be:

For each possible contiguous segment in the sorted array where max - min <=1:

- The sum of this segment is S. If S <=m, then it's a candidate.

- If S >m, then we can take the largest possible subset of flowers from this segment, starting from the largest (since they are sorted), adding them until the sum is <=m.

But how do we efficiently compute this for all possible such segments?

But even considering all possible segments where max - min <=1 is O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=2e5.

Therefore, we need a more efficient approach.

Alternative idea: Since the array is sorted, the maximum possible sum for a contiguous segment where max - min <=1 is when the segment is as large as possible. So perhaps, the optimal solution can be found by considering the largest possible such segments. For example, the segments where a[j] - a[i] <=1, and the segment is as large as possible.

But even this approach would require checking for all possible i and j, which is O(n^2). Not feasible.

Another angle: Since the array is sorted, for each index j, find the smallest i such that a[j] - a[i] <=1. Then, the sum from i to j is a candidate. Then, for each j, compute the sum from i to j and see if it's <=m. If so, it's a candidate. Otherwise, we can take the maximum possible sum from the elements in i..j that is <=m.

But for each j, how to compute the minimal i where a[j] -a[i] <=1.

Since the array is sorted, this can be done using binary search for each j.

Then, for each j, the largest possible window is [i, j], and the sum is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]. If that sum <=m, then the sum is a candidate. Otherwise, we need to find the maximum number of elements (from the end of the window) that sum to <=m.

But how?

This approach seems feasible.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Sort the array in non-decreasing order.

2. Compute the prefix sums array.

3. For each j in 0..n-1:

   a. Use binary search to find the smallest i such that a[j] -a[i] <=1. So the window [i..j] is the largest possible segment ending at j where the max a[j] and min a[i] differ by <=1.

   b. Compute the sum of this window. If sum <=m, then the sum is a candidate.

   c. If sum >m, then we need to find the maximum sum possible by taking some elements from i to j, possibly excluding some of the lower elements. Because the array is sorted, the elements in the window are non-decreasing. Wait, no: the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, so the elements from i to j are a[j] >=a[i], but the elements in the window may have some that are a[j]-1, etc.

Wait, the array is sorted, so a[i] <= a[i+1] <= ... <= a[j]. So the maximum difference in the window is a[j] -a[i] <=1. So all elements in the window are either a[j] or a[j]-1.

Because the array is sorted, so the first element in the window is a[i], and the last is a[j]. Since the maximum difference is 1, all elements are >=a[j] -1. So the window consists of elements that are either a[j]-1 or a[j].

So in this window, the elements are a[i], a[i+1], ..., a[j]. All are >=a[j]-1 and <=a[j]. So the sum is sum of all these elements. If the sum is <=m, then we can take them all. Otherwise, we need to take a subset of them, but the maximum possible sum would be taking as many of the largest elements as possible.

So in the window [i..j], the sum is S = prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]. If S <=m, then this is a candidate. Otherwise, we need to find the maximum sum of elements from the window, in the largest possible elements, such that their sum is <=m.

Since the elements are sorted, the largest elements are at the end. So we can take the rightmost k elements, where k is as large as possible such that their sum is <=m.

The sum of the rightmost k elements in the window is sum from j -k +1 to j. The prefix sum for that is prefix[j+1] - prefix[j -k +1].

We need to find the maximum k such that this sum <=m.

So for each window [i..j], the possible maximum sum is either S (if S <=m) or the sum of the largest possible k elements in the window (if S >m).

So the problem reduces to, for each j, compute the maximum possible sum in the window [i..j], then take the maximum over all j.

Now, how do we compute this efficiently?

For each j, find i via binary search (O(log n)), then compute S = sum from i to j.

If S <=m, then the candidate is S.

Else, find the maximum k (number of elements to take from the end of the window) such that sum_{x = j -k +1}^j a[x] <= m.

This sum is the sum of the top k elements in the window. Since the elements are sorted in non-decreasing order, the sum increases as k increases. Wait, no. Wait, the elements are in non-decreasing order. So the sum of the top k elements (last k elements) is the sum of the largest elements. So to maximize the sum, we take as many as possible. So for the window [i..j], if the sum is larger than m, then we can perform a binary search on k (from 0 to len) to find the maximum k where the sum of the last k elements is <=m.

But for each j, this would take O(log len) time. Since len can be up to n, this would be O(log n) per j, leading to O(n log n) per test case.

But with n up to 2e5, and t up to 1e4, but sum of n across test cases up to 2e5, this is acceptable.

So, the plan is:

For each test case:

1. Sort the array.

2. Compute prefix sums.

3. For each j from 0 to n-1:

   a. Find the smallest i where a[j] - a[i] <=1.

   b. Compute sum_total = prefix[j+1] - prefix[i].

   c. If sum_total <= m: candidate is sum_total.

   d. Else: find the largest k such that sum of last k elements in [i..j] <=m.

      - sum_k = prefix[j+1] - prefix[j+1 -k]

      - binary search k in 0 to j -i +1.

4. Keep track of the maximum candidate across all j.

Additionally, there's another possible scenario: taking a single flower. For example, if the best is to take the largest flower which has a cost of a_n. So even if a_n is 1e9, if m >=a_n, then the maximum sum is a_n. But this is covered in the approach above, because when j =n-1, i could be such that a[j] -a[i] <=1 (since i could be j). So the window [j..j], sum is a[j], which is considered.

But in some cases, maybe taking a single flower is better than a group. For example, in the third test case where 610 is the maximum, which is taken as a single flower.

But the approach above should handle this, because for j=7 (assuming 0-based), the window would be from i=0 to j=7 (since a[j] -a[i] could be <=1?), but in reality, when the array is sorted, the a[7] is 610, and other elements are smaller. So the window for j=7 (610) would have i=7, sum is 610. Since m is 1e5, which is larger than 610, sum is considered.

So the approach seems to cover all possibilities.

Now, how to implement this.

Let's think about the code structure.

First, sort the array.

Compute prefix sums.

Then, for each j in 0..n-1:

   find the minimal i where a[j] -a[i] <=1.

   i can be found using binary search. For example, the minimal i where a[i] >= (a[j] -1). Because since the array is sorted, a[i] >= a[j] -1 implies that a[j] -a[i] <=1.

   Wait, for a sorted array, a[j] is the largest in the window. So a[i] can be as small as a[j] -1, because a[j] - a[i] <=1 implies a[i] >=a[j]-1.

   So, for each j, the minimal i is the first index where a[i] >= a[j] -1. Because all elements from i to j-1 are >=a[i], which is >=a[j]-1, so a[j] -a[x] <=1 for all x in [i..j].

So, for each j, i is the lower_bound of (a[j]-1) in the array.

Wait, no. Because the array is sorted in non-decreasing order, the first index i where a[i] >= (a[j] -1). So all elements from i to j are >=a[j]-1. Since a[j] is the end of the window, all elements in [i..j] are between a[j]-1 and a[j]. So the difference between any two elements in this window is at most 1.

So yes, for each j, i is the first index where a[i] >= a[j] -1.

So, the binary search for i is to find the leftmost i where a[i] >= (a[j] -1).

Once i is found, the window is i to j.

The sum of this window is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i].

If that sum is <=m, then this sum is a candidate.

Otherwise, we need to find the maximum k (number of elements from the end of the window) such that sum of last k elements is <=m.

But how to compute that sum.

The sum of the last k elements in the window is sum from j -k +1 to j.

But since the elements are sorted, the last k elements are the largest in the window. So to maximize the sum, we take as many as possible.

So, the sum of the last k elements is prefix[j+1] - prefix[j+1 -k].

We need to find the maximum k in 1..window_length such that this sum <=m.

But how to compute this efficiently.

This is equivalent to finding the maximum k where (sum of the last k elements) <=m.

This can be done with a binary search on k.

The possible k ranges from 1 to (j -i +1).

The sum for k elements is prefix[j+1] - prefix[j+1 -k].

We can binary search for the maximum k where this sum <=m.

But how to compute this.

Wait, the prefix array is 0-based. For example, prefix[0] =0, prefix[1] =a[0], prefix[2] =a[0] +a[1], etc.

So, the sum of the last k elements (from position j -k +1 to j) is prefix[j+1] - prefix[j -k +1].

So for a given k, this is the sum. We need to find the maximum k in [1, len] (where len =j -i +1) such that sum <=m.

This can be found using binary search on k.

For example, in the window [i..j], the maximum possible k is the entire window (len). If the sum of the entire window is <=m, then k = len. Otherwise, we need to find the largest k where sum of last k elements is <=m.

So, for each j, after finding i, compute len =j -i +1.

If sum_total = prefix[j+1] - prefix[i] <=m, then candidate is sum_total.

Else, binary search for the maximum k where sum of last k elements (prefix[j+1] - prefix[j+1 -k]) <=m.

The binary search for k would be from low=1 to high=len.

For each mid in binary search:

sum = prefix[j+1] - prefix[j+1 - mid]

if sum <=m: can take mid, try higher.

else: try lower.

Once the maximum k is found, the sum is prefix[j+1] - prefix[j+1 -k], which is the candidate.

So, for each j, compute the maximum between the sum of the window (if possible) and the sum of the best k elements.

Then, track the maximum across all j.

This approach has a time complexity of O(n log n) per test case, which is acceptable given that n is up to 2e5 and sum across test cases is 2e5.

Now, let's think about the edge cases.

Case where all a_i are same. Then, the window is the entire array, sum is sum(a_i). If sum <=m, then that's the candidate. Otherwise, take as many as possible elements (all, but sum exceeds m, so take the largest possible subset. Wait, but sum of entire array exceeds m, so need to take the largest possible k elements (since all are same, sum is k*a_i). So k is m//a_i. But since all are same, perhaps the sum is k*a_i. So the maximum possible sum is min(m//a_i * a_i, sum(a_i)).

But according to the code approach, for each j, the i is found. For example, j is any index. For a_i all same, a[j]-a[i] is 0. So i would be 0 for all j. So for j =n-1, the window is 0..n-1. sum_total is sum(a_i). If sum_total <=m, then it's the candidate. Else, sum of last k elements would be sum(a_i's) of the last k elements. Which, since all elements are same, sum is k * a_j. So the maximum k is m // a_j, and sum is (m//a_j) * a_j.

But in the code approach, since the sum of the last k elements is (k * a_j), then the binary search for k would find the maximum k such that k*a_j <=m. Which is exactly m//a_j. So sum is (m//a_j)*a_j. Which is correct.

Another edge case is when all a_i are distinct and the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. Then, each window [i..j] is of length 1, so sum is a[j]. So for each j, the candidate is a[j] if a[j] <=m. So the maximum is the maximum a_j that's <=m.

Another case: when the sum of the entire window is larger than m, but the sum of some of the last k elements is possible.

For example, m=10, the window sum is 15. So the sum of last k elements must be <=10. Since the elements are sorted, the sum of the last k elements is as large as possible. So we can take as many as possible.

Now, how to implement the binary search for k.

For each j and i, len =j -i +1.

We need to perform a binary search over k in 1..len, and find the largest k where sum of the last k elements <=m.

But how to compute this sum for any k in O(1) using the prefix array.

Yes, since sum = prefix[j+1] - prefix[j+1 -k].

So in code:

low = 1

high = len

best_k =0

best_sum=0

while low <=high:

   mid = (low + high) //2

   current_sum = prefix[j+1] - prefix[j+1 -mid]

   if current_sum <=m:

       best_k =mid

       best_sum= current_sum

       low =mid +1

   else:

       high =mid -1

So after this, best_sum is the maximum sum possible from the window's elements.

Then, the candidate is best_sum.

So the code for each j would be:

i = find the first index where a[i] >=a[j]-1.

sum_total = prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]

if sum_total <=m:

   current_candidate = sum_total

else:

   len_window =j -i +1

   low=1

   high = len_window

   best_k=0

   best_sum=0

   while low <=high:

       mid = (low +high)//2

       s = prefix[j+1] - prefix[j+1 -mid]

       if s <=m:

           best_k=mid

           best_sum =s

           low=mid+1

       else:

           high=mid-1

   current_candidate = best_sum

max_answer = max(max_answer, current_candidate)

Thus, the code would proceed as such.

Now, let's test this approach against the sample input.

Sample Input 1:

5

First test case:

5 10

1 1 2 2 3

After sorting: [1,1,2,2,3]

prefix = [0,1,2,4,6,9]

For each j in 0..4.

Let's take j=4 (a[j] =3):

i is the first index where a[i] >=3-1=2. The array elements are [1,1,2,2,3]. So a[i] >=2. The first index where a[i] is >=2 is index 2 (a[2] =2). So i=2.

sum_total = prefix[5] - prefix[2] =9 -4=5. 5<=10. So current_candidate=5. Max is 5.

Wait, but the sample output is 7.

Hmm. What's wrong here.

Wait, let's see. The first test case sample output is 7, which comes from the bouquet (2,2,3) sum 7.

So according to the code approach, how is this handled.

In the sorted array, the 3 is at j=4. The code will check j=4, find i=2 (a[j] -1=2). The sum from i=2 to j=4 is 2+2+3 =7. Wait, prefix[5] (j=4) is 9, prefix[2] is 4. 9-4=5. Wait, that's 2+3? No. Wait, the sorted array is [1,1,2,2,3], so prefix array is:

prefix[0] =0

prefix[1] =1 (sum first element)

prefix[2] =1+1=2

prefix[3] =2+2=4

prefix[4] =4+2=6

prefix[5] =6+3=9.

So for j=4 (element 3), i=2. The sum from i=2 (prefix[2] is 2) to j=4 is prefix[5] - prefix[2] =9-2=7. Oh right! Wait, because j+1 is 5, so the sum from i=2 to j=4 is prefix[5] (sum of first 5 elements) minus prefix[2] (sum of first 2 elements). So 9-2=7.

Ah, right! So sum_total is 7, which is <=10. So current_candidate=7.

So the maximum would be 7, which matches the sample.

So that's correct. So for j=4, i=2, sum_total=7. That's the correct candidate.

So why did I get confused earlier? Oh because I made a mistake in the index calculation. The code uses j+1 as the end index of the prefix. So the sum from i to j is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i].

So the code works.

Another example: in the third test case:

8 100000

239 30 610 122 24 40 8 2

After sorting: [2,8,24,30,40,122,239,610]

prefix is [0,2,10,34,64,104,226,465, 1075 (2+8+24+30+40+122+239+610= 2+8=10, +24=34, +30=64, +40=104, +122=226, +239=465, +610=1075)].

For j=7 (610), a[j] -1=609. The first i where a[i]>=609 is i=7 (since all elements before are smaller). sum_total is 610. 610 <=1e5, so candidate is 610. Which is the sample output.

Another example: fourth test case.

Input:

11 13

2 4 11 1 1 2 3 5 4 3 2

Sorted array: [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,11,11]

Wait, wait. Original array is [2,4,11,1,1,2,3,5,4,3,2]. Wait, count the elements: 11 elements. Sorted would be:

1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,11.

So for j=8 (element 5), a[j] is 5. So a[j]-1=4. The first i where a[i] >=4 is index 7 (a[7]=4). So window is i=7 to j=8. The elements are 4,5. sum is 4+5=9 <=13. So candidate is 9.

But the sample's output is 13. So where does this come from?

Wait, the sample's note says the answer is 13, which is 4+4+5=13.

So the bouquet is [4,4,5], sum 13.

In the sorted array, these are elements at indices 7,8,9 (if 5 is at index 9?), but the sorted array is [1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,11]. So the elements 4 (indexes 7,8), 5 (index9). So for j=9 (element5), a[j]-1=4. The first i where a[i] >=4 is 7. So window is from 7 to9. sum is 4+4+5=13, which is <=13. So this is the candidate.

Thus, in the code, when j=9, the sum is 13. So the code will consider this as a candidate.

So the code would pick this as the maximum.

Thus, the code works.

So the approach seems correct.

Now, implementing this in Python.

First, for each test case, read n and m, then the array. Sort the array, compute the prefix sum.

Then, for each j, binary search i as the first index where a[i] >= a[j]-1.

Then compute sum_total, and if sum_total <=m, take it. Else, binary search the maximum k.

Now, in Python, the binary search for i can be done using bisect.bisect_left.

For example, for each j, target =a[j]-1.

i = bisect.bisect_left(a, target)

But since the array is sorted, this returns the first index where a[i] >=target.

Yes.

So, code outline:

import bisect

t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):

    a.sort()

    max_sum =0

    for j in range(n):

        target = a[j] -1

        sum_total = prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]

        if sum_total <=m:

            current = sum_total

        else:

            # binary search for k

            low =1

            while low <=high:

                mid = (low +high) //2

                if start <i:

                    # not possible, since start must be >=i

                    # because mid can't be larger than j -i +1.

                    # since high is j -i +1, start =j+1 -mid >= j+1 - (j-i+1) = i.

                    # so no need to check.

                s = prefix[j+1] - prefix[start]

                if s <=m:

                    current = max(current, s)

                    low = mid +1

                else:

                    high = mid -1

        if current > max_sum:

            max_sum = current

    print(max_sum)

Wait, but the code above for the 'else' part (sum_total >m) needs to compute the maximum sum possible by taking some elements from the window.

But in the code above, even if sum_total is <=m, the code takes sum_total. Otherwise, the code performs the binary search.

But let's make sure that the code correctly computes the maximum between sum_total (if possible) and the binary search result.

In the code above, for each j:

if sum_total <=m:

    current = sum_total

else:

    binary search to find current as the maximum sum of last k elements <=m.

Then compare current with max_sum.

This should be correct.

But let's test it against the fourth test case:

Sample Input 4:

11 13

2 4 11 1 1 2 3 5 4 3 2

After sorting: [1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,11]

prefix is:

0,1,2,4,6,8,11,14,18,22,27,38.

For j=8 (element4) (assuming 0-based index. Wait, sorted array is 0-based:

Indices 0-10:

0:1, 1:1, 2:2, 3:2, 4:2, 5:3, 6:3, 7:4, 8:4, 9:5, 10:11.

For j=9 (element5), a[j] is5. a[j]-1=4.

bisect_left finds the first index where a[i] >=4. Looking at the array:

a[7]=4, a[8]=4, a[9]=5, etc. So the first i where a[i] >=4 is 7.

sum_total is prefix[9+1] - prefix[7] = prefix[10] - prefix[7] =27 -18=9. But sum_total is 9 <=13, so current is 9. But the actual answer is 13. So how is this handled?

Wait, j=9 is the 5 in the array. Let's see:

For j=9, target is5-1=4.

i is 7 (a[7]=4).

sum_total is sum from i=7 to j=9: a[7]=4, a[8]=4, a[9]=5. Sum is4+4+5=13. Yes.

prefix[j+1] is prefix[10] =27 (sum of first 9 elements: 1+1+2+2+2+3+3+4+4+5= 1+1=2, +2=4, +2=6, +2=8, +3=11, +3=14, +4=18, +4=22, +5=27. So prefix[10] is 27.

prefix[i] =prefix[7] is 18.

sum_total=27-18=9? Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, prefix[10] is sum of first 10 elements (indices 0-9). So j=9 (element5) is index9. So j+1=10.

sum_total is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i] =prefix[10] - prefix[7] =27 -18=9. But the actual sum is 4+4+5=13. What's wrong here.

Wait, the prefix array calculation may be incorrect.

Wait, let's recompute the prefix array for the sorted array [1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,11]. Wait, no, the fourth test case has 11 flowers. The sorted array is:

Original a: [2,4,11,1,1,2,3,5,4,3,2]. After sorting:

1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,11. So 11 elements.

So prefix has 12 elements.

prefix[0] =0.

prefix[1] =1.

prefix[2] =1+1=2.

prefix[3] =2+2=4.

prefix[4] =4+2=6.

prefix[5] =6+3=9.

prefix[6] =9+3=12.

prefix[7] =12+4=16.

prefix[8] =16+4=20.

prefix[9] =20+5=25.

prefix[10] =25+11=36.

prefix[11] =36 (but no 11th element since j can't be 10 in the code).

Wait, wait, the code uses j from 0 to n-1. n is 11 here.

So for j=9 (element5), which is index9 in 0-based.

sum_total is prefix[j+1] - prefix[i] =prefix[10] - prefix[7] =25 (prefix[10] is sum up to index9) which is 1+1+2+2+2+3+3+4+4+5 = 1+1=2, +2=4, +2=6, +2=8, +3=11, +3=14, +4=18, +4=22, +5=27. Wait, wait, this is not right.

Wait, the 10 elements:

elements are indices 0-10 (since n=11). Wait no, j ranges from 0 to n-1 (0 to 10 for n=11). So when j is 9 (element5), the sum from i=7 to j=9 is elements 7,8,9.

elements 7,8,9 are 4,4,5.

sum is4+4+5=13.

prefix[j+1] is prefix[10], which is sum of elements 0-9.

Wait, the code computes the prefix array as:

prefix[0] =0

prefix[1] =a[0]

prefix[2] =a[0]+a[1]

...

prefix[11] =sum of a[0..10]

So for j=9, j+1=10. prefix[10] is sum of a[0..9].

The elements 0..9 are 1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,5. Sum is 1+1=2, +2=4, +2=6, +2=8, +3=11, +3=14, +4=18, +4=22, +5=27.

prefix[10] is 27.

prefix[i] is prefix[7], which is sum of a[0..6], which is 1+1+2+2+2+3+3 = 14.

So sum_total =27 -14 =13. Which is correct. So current_candidate is 13.

Thus, the code would capture this.

So why did I earlier think that sum_total was 9? Because I made a mistake in the example.

So the code is correct.

Thus, the code should work.

Now, the code must be optimized for speed. Using bisect in Python is O(1) for each j? No, bisect is O(log n) per j. So with n up to 2e5, this is acceptable.

But in Python, for multiple test cases, the code needs to read input quickly. Using input() for each line can be slow for large inputs. So it's better to read all input at once.

But in the problem statement, it's required to read from stdin using input(), and write to stdout using print(). So we need to make sure that the code reads the inputs efficiently.

In Python, using sys.stdin.readline is faster than input(), but according to the problem statement, the code must read via input(). So in the code, the code uses input().

But for n up to 2e5 and t up to 1e4, with sum of n across test cases up to 2e5, the code should handle it.

But in Python, reading multiple lines with input() may be slow if not handled properly. To speed up, we can read all input at once using sys.stdin.read(), split into tokens, and process them. But the code must read input from stdin via input(). However, the problem statement says the code must use input() and print().

But for the code to be efficient, we can read the entire input at once, split into tokens, and process.

So, modifying the code:

import bisect

import sys

def main():

    import sys

    input = sys.stdin.read().split()

    ptr=0

    t=int(input[ptr])

    ptr +=1

    for _ in range(t):

        n = int(input[ptr])

        m = int(input[ptr+1])

        ptr +=2

        a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr+n]))

        ptr +=n

        a.sort()

        prefix = [0]*(n+1)

        for i in range(n):

            prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + a[i]

        max_sum =0

        for j in range(n):

            target = a[j] -1

            i = bisect.bisect_left(a, target, 0, j+1)

            sum_total = prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]

            if sum_total <=m:

                current = sum_total

                if current > max_sum:

                    max_sum = current

            else:

                # Binary search for k

                low =1

                high = j -i +1

                best =0

                while low <= high:

                    mid = (low + high) //2

                    start = j+1 -mid

                    if start <i:

                        # Not possible, so skip (but mid is bounded by j-i+1)

                        high = mid -1

                        continue

                    s = prefix[j+1] - prefix[start]

                    if s <=m:

                        best = s

                        low = mid +1

                    else:

                        high = mid -1

                if best > max_sum:

                    max_sum = best

        print(max_sum)

But this code uses sys.stdin.read() to read all input at once. Which is faster.

However, the problem statement says that the solution must read input via input().

Wait, the problem statement says:

Your solution must read input from standard input (input()), write output to standard output (print()).

So using sys.stdin.read() is not allowed. Thus, the code must use input().

But for large inputs, using input() for each line can be slow. For example, reading 2e5 numbers via input() can be slow.

Thus, for Python, the way to read inputs quickly is to read via sys.stdin.read(), but the problem statement specifies that we must read via input(). So perhaps the code will pass, but may have some time issues.

But given the problem's time constraints (1.5 seconds per test), the code must be optimized.

In the code above, even with input() for each line, the code may work, but for large inputs, it may be tight.

But the code as written uses the standard approach and should be correct.

Another optimization: in the binary search for k, we can calculate the maximum k possible even faster.

For example, the sum of the last k elements is the sum of the largest k elements in the window. Since the array is sorted, these are the last k elements.

We can binary search for k in the range 1 to len_window.

But another approach is to precompute the prefix sums, and for each j and i, compute the maximum k such that the sum of the last k elements is <=m.

Yes, the code as written does this.

Thus, the code should work correctly.
