Okay, let's see. The problem is to count the number of distinct letters in Anton's set. The input is a string that starts with '{' and ends with '}', and in between are letters separated by ', '.

Looking at the mutant code: The code takes the input string, strips it, checks if the length is 3. If so, outputs 0. Otherwise, it takes the substring from index 1 to -1 (so removing the braces), splits by ', ', converts to a set, and takes the length. 

Wait, but what if the input is empty? Like the third example, which is "{}", the length is 2. So the code checks if len(s) == 3. Wait, the input is given as a single line. For example, the third test case is "{}", which has length 2. So the code's condition len(s) ==3 would be false. Wait, the code's first condition is if len(s) ==3: print(0). But in the third example, the input is "{}", which is two characters. So the code would go to the else clause. Then s[1:-1] would be the substring from index 1 to -1, which for "{}" is the empty string. Splitting an empty string by ', ' would give [''], but then converting to a set would have one element (the empty string), and len would be 1. But the correct output is 0. So that's a bug here.

Ah, right. The mutant code's logic is flawed. Because when the input is "{}", the code's else clause would process s[1:-1] as an empty string. Splitting that by ', ' gives a list with one empty string. So the set would have that empty string, and len is 1. But the correct answer is 0. So the code's condition is wrong. The code checks if len(s) ==3, which would be for cases like "{a}" (but that's not possible according to the problem's input format, since the letters are separated by commas and spaces. Wait, the input format says that between the letters are separated by a comma followed by a space. So the minimal non-empty case is like "{a}", which would have length 3. But according to the problem's input, the line is guaranteed to start with '{' and end with '}'. So the input can be "{}" (length 2) which is the empty set. So the code's first condition checks if len(s) ==3. But in the case of "{}", len(s) is 2, so it goes to else. Then s[1:-1] is empty string. Splitting by ', ' gives [''], which when converted to a set has one element (the empty string), so len is 1. But the correct answer is 0. So the code is wrong here.

So the bug is in the initial condition. The code checks if the length is 3, which would handle cases where there's exactly one character inside the braces. But for the empty case, the code's else clause is executed, leading to an incorrect count.

So the correct approach is to check if the length of the string is 2 (i.e., "{}"), then output 0. Otherwise, process the inner part. But how to handle the inner part correctly.

The correct approach is: if the string is "{}", then output 0. Otherwise, split the inner part (s[1:-1]) by ', ' and count the number of unique elements. But in the case where the inner part is empty (like s[1:-1] is empty), splitting would give [''], which we need to filter out. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be correct. So when the input is "{}", the inner part is empty. So in that case, the split would result in an empty list? Wait, no. Let's see: s = "{}", s[1:-1] is an empty string. Then s[1:-1].split(', ') would split the empty string. Splitting an empty string with split(', ') gives [''], because the split method splits on the separator. So if the string is empty, the split returns a list with one element, the empty string. So in the case of "{}", the code would split into [''], then the set would have one element (the empty string), and the length would be 1, which is wrong. So the code's logic is incorrect.

So the correct approach is: if the string is "{}", output 0. Otherwise, split the inner part (s[1:-1]) by ', ', and then count the number of elements in the set, but only if the elements are non-empty. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be correct. So when the input is not "{}", the inner part is a list of letters separated by ', ', each of which is a single lowercase letter. So in the case of "{}", the inner part is empty. So the code should check if the inner part is empty. So the correct code would be:

s = input().strip()
if s == '{}':
    print(0)
else:
    parts = s[1:-1].split(', ')
    print(len(set(parts)))

But wait, in the case where the input is "{}", s[1:-1] is empty, so parts is [''], and the set would have one element (the empty string). So the code would print 1, which is wrong. So the code needs to handle the case where the inner part is empty. So the correct approach is to check if the inner part is empty. So:

inner = s[1:-1]
if not inner:
    print(0)
else:
    parts = inner.split(', ')
    print(len(set(parts)))

Yes. So the code should first check if the inner part is empty. So the original code's condition (len(s) ==3) is incorrect. For example, the input "{a}" would have len(s) 3, but according to the problem's input format, that's not possible. Because the input is a list of letters separated by ', ', so the minimal non-empty case would be "{a}"? Wait, no. Because the problem says that the letters are separated by a comma followed by a space. So each letter is followed by ', ', except the last one. So the correct input for a single element would be "{a}"? Or is the input required to have the elements separated by ', ' even if there's only one element?

Wait, the problem statement says: "small English letters are listed, separated by a comma. Each comma is followed by a space." So the input for a single element would be "{a}"? Because there's no comma. So the input for a single element would be like "{a}". So the inner part is "a", which when split by ', ' gives ["a"], which is correct. So the code's original approach of checking len(s) ==3 (i.e., the input is "{x}") would output 1, which is correct. But the code's else clause would handle other cases. But the problem is when the input is "{}", which has len(s) 2, so the code's else clause is executed, leading to s[1:-1] being empty, split into [''], set size 1, which is wrong.

So the correct code should first check if the inner part is empty. So the code should be:

s = input().strip()
inner = s[1:-1]
if not inner:
    print(0)
else:
    parts = inner.split(', ')
    print(len(set(parts)))

This would handle all cases. For example:

Case 1: "{}" → inner is empty → print 0.

Case 2: "{a}" → inner is "a" → split into ["a"] → set size 1.

Case 3: "{a, b, c}" → split into ["a", "b", "c"] → set size 3.

Case 4: "{b, a, b, a}" → split into ["b", "a", "b", "a"] → set size 2.

So the original code's condition (len(s) ==3) is incorrect. It should check if the inner part is empty, not the length of the entire string.

So the mutant code's bug is in the initial condition. It checks if len(s) ==3, which would only handle the case where there's exactly one character inside the braces. But the correct check is whether the inner part (s[1:-1]) is empty. So the code should first check if the inner part is empty.

So the correct code is as I wrote above.

Now, the code needs to read the input, process it as per the problem statement.

Now, considering the constraints: the input line can be up to 1000 characters. So even with maximum input, the code's approach is O(n) time, which is acceptable.

So the correct code is:

s = input().strip()
inner = s[1:-1]
if not inner:
    print(0)
else:
    print(len(set(inner.split(', '))))

This should handle all cases correctly.

Testing the examples:

First example input: "{a, b, c}" → inner is "a, b, c" → split into ["a", "b", "c"] → set size 3 → output 3.

Second example: "{b, a, b, a}" → split into ["b", "a", "b", "a"] → set size 2 → output 2.

Third example: "{}" → inner is empty → output 0.

Another test case: "{a}" → inner is "a" → split into ["a"] → output 1.

Another test case: "{a, a}" → split into ["a", "a"] → set size 1 → output 1.

So the code works.

The original mutant code's problem was that it checked len(s) ==3, which would only handle the case where the input is like "{x}", but the correct check is whether the inner part is empty. So the code's condition was incorrect, leading to wrong output for the empty case.

So the correct code is as written.
